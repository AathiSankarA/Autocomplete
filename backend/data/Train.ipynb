A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA\\n\\nI.\\n\\n\\nTo Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men\\'s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\\n\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\\n\\nOne night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\\n\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\\n\\n\"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"\\n\\n\"Seven!\" I answered.\\n\\n\"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"\\n\\n\"Then, how do you know?\"\\n\\n\"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Holmes,\" said I, \"this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can\\'t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.\"\\n\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\n\\n\"It is simplicity itself,\" said he; \"my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\"\\n\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. \"When I hear you give your reasons,\" I remarked, \"the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so,\" he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. \"You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\"\\n\\n\"Frequently.\"\\n\\n\"How often?\"\\n\\n\"Well, some hundreds of times.\"\\n\\n\"Then how many are there?\"\\n\\n\"How many? I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\" He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. \"It came by the last post,\" said he. \"Read it aloud.\"\\n\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\n\\n\"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\\'clock,\" it said, \"a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\"\\n\\n\"This is indeed a mystery,\" I remarked. \"What do you imagine that it means?\"\\n\\n\"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?\"\\n\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\\n\\n\"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\" I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion\\'s processes. \"Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.\"\\n\\n\"Peculiar--that is the very word,\" said Holmes. \"It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.\"\\n\\nI did so, and saw a large \"E\" with a small \"g,\" a \"P,\" and a large \"G\" with a small \"t\" woven into the texture of the paper.\\n\\n\"What do you make of that?\" asked Holmes.\\n\\n\"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all. The \\'G\\' with the small \\'t\\' stands for \\'Gesellschaft,\\' which is the German for \\'Company.\\' It is a customary contraction like our \\'Co.\\' \\'P,\\' of course, stands for \\'Papier.\\' Now for the \\'Eg.\\' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.\" He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. \"Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \\'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.\\' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?\" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\\n\\n\"The paper was made in Bohemia,\" I said.\\n\\n\"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--\\'This account of you we have from all quarters received.\\' A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\\' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.\\n\\n\"A pair, by the sound,\" said he. \"Yes,\" he continued, glancing out of the window. \"A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There\\'s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.\"\\n\\n\"I think that I had better go, Holmes.\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\"\\n\\n\"But your client--\"\\n\\n\"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\"\\n\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.\\n\\n\"Come in!\" said Holmes.\\n\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\\n\\n\"You had my note?\" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. \"I told you that I would call.\" He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\n\\n\"Pray take a seat,\" said Holmes. \"This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?\"\\n\\n\"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.\"\\n\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. \"It is both, or none,\" said he. \"You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.\"\\n\\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \"Then I must begin,\" said he, \"by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.\"\\n\\n\"I promise,\" said Holmes.\\n\\n\"And I.\"\\n\\n\"You will excuse this mask,\" continued our strange visitor. \"The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.\"\\n\\n\"I was aware of it,\" said Holmes dryly.\\n\\n\"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.\"\\n\\n\"I was also aware of that,\" murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.\\n\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\\n\\n\"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\" he remarked, \"I should be better able to advise you.\"\\n\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \"You are right,\" he cried; \"I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\"\\n\\n\"Why, indeed?\" murmured Holmes. \"Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.\"\\n\\n\"But you can understand,\" said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \"you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\"\\n\\n\"Then, pray consult,\" said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\n\\n\"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\"\\n\\n\"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\" murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\\n\\n\"Let me see!\" said Holmes. \"Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.\"\\n\\n\"Precisely so. But how--\"\\n\\n\"Was there a secret marriage?\"\\n\\n\"None.\"\\n\\n\"No legal papers or certificates?\"\\n\\n\"None.\"\\n\\n\"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?\"\\n\\n\"There is the writing.\"\\n\\n\"Pooh, pooh! Forgery.\"\\n\\n\"My private note-paper.\"\\n\\n\"Stolen.\"\\n\\n\"My own seal.\"\\n\\n\"Imitated.\"\\n\\n\"My photograph.\"\\n\\n\"Bought.\"\\n\\n\"We were both in the photograph.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.\"\\n\\n\"I was mad--insane.\"\\n\\n\"You have compromised yourself seriously.\"\\n\\n\"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\"\\n\\n\"It must be recovered.\"\\n\\n\"We have tried and failed.\"\\n\\n\"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\"\\n\\n\"She will not sell.\"\\n\\n\"Stolen, then.\"\\n\\n\"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.\"\\n\\n\"No sign of it?\"\\n\\n\"Absolutely none.\"\\n\\nHolmes laughed. \"It is quite a pretty little problem,\" said he.\\n\\n\"But a very serious one to me,\" returned the King reproachfully.\\n\\n\"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\"\\n\\n\"To ruin me.\"\\n\\n\"But how?\"\\n\\n\"I am about to be married.\"\\n\\n\"So I have heard.\"\\n\\n\"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.\"\\n\\n\"And Irene Adler?\"\\n\\n\"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none.\"\\n\\n\"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?\"\\n\\n\"I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"And why?\"\\n\\n\"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, then we have three days yet,\" said Holmes with a yawn. \"That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.\"\\n\\n\"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\"\\n\\n\"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\"\\n\\n\"Then, as to money?\"\\n\\n\"You have carte blanche.\"\\n\\n\"Absolutely?\"\\n\\n\"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.\"\\n\\n\"And for present expenses?\"\\n\\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.\\n\\n\"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\" he said.\\n\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.\\n\\n\"And Mademoiselle\\'s address?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John\\'s Wood.\"\\n\\nHolmes took a note of it. \"One other question,\" said he. \"Was the photograph a cabinet?\"\\n\\n\"It was.\"\\n\\n\"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\" he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \"If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o\\'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.\"\\n\\nII.\\n\\n\\nAt three o\\'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o\\'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\\n\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend\\'s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\\n\\n\"Well, really!\" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\\n\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o\\'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.\\n\\n\"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.\"\\n\\n\"And what of Irene Adler?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Oh, she has turned all the men\\'s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.\\n\\n\"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman\\'s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.\"\\n\\n\"I am following you closely,\" I answered.\\n\\n\"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.\\n\\n\"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, \\'Drive like the devil,\\' he shouted, \\'first to Gross & Hankey\\'s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!\\'\\n\\n\"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn\\'t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\\n\\n\" \\'The Church of St. Monica, John,\\' she cried, \\'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\\'\\n\\n\"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. \\'The Church of St. Monica,\\' said I, \\'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\\' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\\n\\n\"My cabby drove fast. I don\\'t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\\n\\n\" \\'Thank God,\\' he cried. \\'You\\'ll do. Come! Come!\\'\\n\\n\" \\'What then?\\' I asked.\\n\\n\" \\'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\\'t be legal.\\'\\n\\n\"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.\"\\n\\n\"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\" said I; \"and what then?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. \\'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,\\' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.\"\\n\\n\"Which are?\"\\n\\n\"Some cold beef and a glass of beer,\" he answered, ringing the bell. \"I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.\"\\n\\n\"I shall be delighted.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t mind breaking the law?\"\\n\\n\"Not in the least.\"\\n\\n\"Nor running a chance of arrest?\"\\n\\n\"Not in a good cause.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, the cause is excellent!\"\\n\\n\"Then I am your man.\"\\n\\n\"I was sure that I might rely on you.\"\\n\\n\"But what is it you wish?\"\\n\\n\"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now,\" he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, \"I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\"\\n\\n\"And what then?\"\\n\\n\"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?\"\\n\\n\"I am to be neutral?\"\\n\\n\"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?\"\\n\\n\"Entirely.\"\\n\\n\"It is nothing very formidable,\" he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. \"It is an ordinary plumber\\'s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?\"\\n\\n\"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.\"\\n\\n\"Precisely.\"\\n\\n\"Then you may entirely rely on me.\"\\n\\n\"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.\"\\n\\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.\\n\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes\\' succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.\\n\\n\"You see,\" remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, \"this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?\"\\n\\n\"Where, indeed?\"\\n\\n\"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman\\'s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.\"\\n\\n\"Where, then?\"\\n\\n\"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.\"\\n\\n\"But it has twice been burgled.\"\\n\\n\"Pshaw! They did not know how to look.\"\\n\\n\"But how will you look?\"\\n\\n\"I will not look.\"\\n\\n\"What then?\"\\n\\n\"I will get her to show me.\"\\n\\n\"But she will refuse.\"\\n\\n\"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.\\n\\n\"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"He is dead,\" cried several voices.\\n\\n\"No, no, there\\'s life in him!\" shouted another. \"But he\\'ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s a brave fellow,\" said a woman. \"They would have had the lady\\'s purse and watch if it hadn\\'t been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he\\'s breathing now.\"\\n\\n\"He can\\'t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\"\\n\\n\"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!\"\\n\\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.\\n\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of \"Fire!\" The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids--joined in a general shriek of \"Fire!\" Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend\\'s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\\n\\n\"You did it very nicely, Doctor,\" he remarked. \"Nothing could have been better. It is all right.\"\\n\\n\"You have the photograph?\"\\n\\n\"I know where it is.\"\\n\\n\"And how did you find out?\"\\n\\n\"She showed me, as I told you she would.\"\\n\\n\"I am still in the dark.\"\\n\\n\"I do not wish to make a mystery,\" said he, laughing. \"The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\"\\n\\n\"I guessed as much.\"\\n\\n\"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\"\\n\\n\"That also I could fathom.\"\\n\\n\"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.\"\\n\\n\"How did that help you?\"\\n\\n\"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\"\\n\\n\"And now?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.\"\\n\\n\"And when will you call?\"\\n\\n\"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.\"\\n\\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\\n\\n\"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\"\\n\\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve heard that voice before,\" said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. \"Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\"\\n\\nIII.\\n\\n\\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\\n\\n\"You have really got it!\" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\\n\\n\"Not yet.\"\\n\\n\"But you have hopes?\"\\n\\n\"I have hopes.\"\\n\\n\"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\"\\n\\n\"We must have a cab.\"\\n\\n\"No, my brougham is waiting.\"\\n\\n\"Then that will simplify matters.\" We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.\\n\\n\"Irene Adler is married,\" remarked Holmes.\\n\\n\"Married! When?\"\\n\\n\"Yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"But to whom?\"\\n\\n\"To an English lawyer named Norton.\"\\n\\n\"But she could not love him.\"\\n\\n\"I am in hopes that she does.\"\\n\\n\"And why in hopes?\"\\n\\n\"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty\\'s plan.\"\\n\\n\"It is true. And yet--! Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!\" He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\\n\\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.\\n\\n\"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\" said she.\\n\\n\"I am Mr. Holmes,\" answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.\\n\\n\"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent.\"\\n\\n\"What!\" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. \"Do you mean that she has left England?\"\\n\\n\"Never to return.\"\\n\\n\"And the papers?\" asked the King hoarsely. \"All is lost.\"\\n\\n\"We shall see.\" He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to \"Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.\" My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\\n\\n\"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.\\n\\n\"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.\\n\\n\"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\n\\n\\n\"Very truly yours,              \\n\"IRENE NORTON, nee ADLER.\"\\n\\n\"What a woman--oh, what a woman!\" cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. \"Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?\"\\n\\n\"From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your Majesty,\" said Holmes coldly. \"I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty\\'s business to a more successful conclusion.\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary, my dear sir,\" cried the King; \"nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\"\\n\\n\"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring--\" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.\\n\\n\"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,\" said Holmes.\\n\\n\"You have but to name it.\"\\n\\n\"This photograph!\"\\n\\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\\n\\n\"Irene\\'s photograph!\" he cried. \"Certainly, if you wish it.\"\\n\\n\"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good morning.\" He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\\n\\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman\\'s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.\\n\\nADVENTURE  II.  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\\n\\n\\nI had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\\n\\n\"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,\" he said cordially.\\n\\n\"I was afraid that you were engaged.\"\\n\\n\"So I am. Very much so.\"\\n\\n\"Then I can wait in the next room.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.\"\\n\\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\\n\\n\"Try the settee,\" said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. \"I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.\"\\n\\n\"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\" I observed.\\n\\n\"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.\"\\n\\n\"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\"\\n\\n\"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\"\\n\\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.\\n\\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd\\'s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes\\' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. \"Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.\"\\n\\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\\n\\n\"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked. \"How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It\\'s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship\\'s carpenter.\"\\n\\n\"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.\"\\n\\n\"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\"\\n\\n\"I won\\'t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?\"\\n\\n\"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?\"\\n\\n\"Well, but China?\"\\n\\n\"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes\\' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.\"\\n\\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. \"Well, I never!\" said he. \"I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all.\"\\n\\n\"I begin to think, Watson,\" said Holmes, \"that I make a mistake in explaining. \\'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,\\' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have got it now,\" he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. \"Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir.\"\\n\\nI took the paper from him and read as follows:\\n\\n\"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o\\'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope\\'s Court, Fleet Street.\"\\n\\n\"What on earth does this mean?\" I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.\\n\\nHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. \"It is a little off the beaten track, isn\\'t it?\" said he. \"And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date.\"\\n\\n\"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.\"\\n\\n\"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?\"\\n\\n\"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \"I have a small pawnbroker\\'s business at Coburg Square, near the City. It\\'s not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.\"\\n\\n\"What is the name of this obliging youth?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n\"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he\\'s not such a youth, either. It\\'s hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?\"\\n\\n\"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don\\'t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he has his faults, too,\" said Mr. Wilson. \"Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he\\'s a good worker. There\\'s no vice in him.\"\\n\\n\"He is still with you, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that\\'s all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.\\n\\n\"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:\\n\\n\" \\'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Why that?\\' I asks.\\n\\n\" \\'Why,\\' says he, \\'here\\'s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It\\'s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits\\' end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here\\'s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Why, what is it, then?\\' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn\\'t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.\\n\\n\" \\'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?\\' he asked with his eyes open.\\n\\n\" \\'Never.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'And what are they worth?\\' I asked.\\n\\n\" \\'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one\\'s other occupations.\\'\\n\\n\"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.\\n\\n\" \\'Tell me all about it,\\' said I.\\n\\n\" \\'Well,\\' said he, showing me the advertisement, \\'you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'But,\\' said I, \\'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Not so many as you might think,\\' he answered. \\'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.\\'\\n\\n\"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\\n\\n\"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope\\'s Court looked like a coster\\'s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.\"\\n\\n\"Your experience has been a most entertaining one,\" remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. \"Pray continue your very interesting statement.\"\\n\\n\"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\\n\\n\" \\'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,\\' said my assistant, \\'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'And he is admirably suited for it,\\' the other answered. \\'He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.\\' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\\n\\n\" \\'It would be injustice to hesitate,\\' said he. \\'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.\\' With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. \\'There is water in your eyes,\\' said he as he released me. \\'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler\\'s wax which would disgust you with human nature.\\' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\\n\\n\" \\'My name,\\' said he, \\'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?\\'\\n\\n\"I answered that I had not.\\n\\n\"His face fell immediately.\\n\\n\" \\'Dear me!\\' he said gravely, \\'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.\\'\\n\\n\"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.\\n\\n\" \\'In the case of another,\\' said he, \\'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,\\' said I.\\n\\n\" \\'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!\\' said Vincent Spaulding. \\'I should be able to look after that for you.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'What would be the hours?\\' I asked.\\n\\n\" \\'Ten to two.\\'\\n\\n\"Now a pawnbroker\\'s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.\\n\\n\" \\'That would suit me very well,\\' said I. \\'And the pay?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Is $4 a week.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'And the work?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Is purely nominal.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'What do you call purely nominal?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don\\'t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'It\\'s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,\\' said I.\\n\\n\" \\'No excuse will avail,\\' said Mr. Duncan Ross; \\'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'And the work?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Is to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Certainly,\\' I answered.\\n\\n\" \\'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.\\' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.\\n\\n\"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope\\'s Court.\\n\\n\"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o\\'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.\\n\\n\"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week\\'s work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.\\n\\n\"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B\\'s before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.\"\\n\\n\"To an end?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o\\'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.\"\\n\\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:\\n\\n\\nTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\\n\\nIS\\n\\nDISSOLVED.\\n\\nOctober 9, 1890.\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.\\n\\n\"I cannot see that there is anything very funny,\" cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. \"If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. \"I really wouldn\\'t miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?\"\\n\\n\"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.\\n\\n\" \\'Well,\\' said I, \\'the gentleman at No. 4.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'What, the red-headed man?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Yes.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Oh,\\' said he, \\'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Where could I find him?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul\\'s.\\'\\n\\n\"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.\"\\n\\n\"And what did you do then?\" asked Holmes.\\n\\n\"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.\"\\n\\n\"And you did very wisely,\" said Holmes. \"Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.\"\\n\\n\"Grave enough!\" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. \"Why, I have lost four pound a week.\"\\n\\n\"As far as you are personally concerned,\" remarked Holmes, \"I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some $30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.\"\\n\\n\"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?\"\\n\\n\"About a month then.\"\\n\\n\"How did he come?\"\\n\\n\"In answer to an advertisement.\"\\n\\n\"Was he the only applicant?\"\\n\\n\"No, I had a dozen.\"\\n\\n\"Why did you pick him?\"\\n\\n\"Because he was handy and would come cheap.\"\\n\\n\"At half wages, in fact.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?\"\\n\\n\"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he\\'s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.\"\\n\\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. \"I thought as much,\" said he. \"Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.\"\\n\\n\"Hum!\" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. \"He is still with you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.\"\\n\\n\"And has your business been attended to in your absence?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing to complain of, sir. There\\'s never very much to do of a morning.\"\\n\\n\"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Watson,\" said Holmes when our visitor had left us, \"what do you make of it all?\"\\n\\n\"I make nothing of it,\" I answered frankly. \"It is a most mysterious business.\"\\n\\n\"As a rule,\" said Holmes, \"the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.\"\\n\\n\"What are you going to do, then?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"To smoke,\" he answered. \"It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won\\'t speak to me for fifty minutes.\" He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\\n\\n\"Sarasate plays at the St. James\\'s Hall this afternoon,\" he remarked. \"What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?\"\\n\\n\"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.\"\\n\\n\"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!\"\\n\\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with \"JABEZ WILSON\" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker\\'s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said Holmes, \"I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.\"\\n\\n\"Third right, fourth left,\" answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\\n\\n\"Smart fellow, that,\" observed Holmes as we walked away. \"He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.\"\\n\\n\"Evidently,\" said I, \"Mr. Wilson\\'s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.\"\\n\\n\"Not him.\"\\n\\n\"What then?\"\\n\\n\"The knees of his trousers.\"\\n\\n\"And what did you see?\"\\n\\n\"What I expected to see.\"\\n\\n\"Why did you beat the pavement?\"\\n\\n\"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy\\'s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\"\\n\\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\\n\\n\"Let me see,\" said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, \"I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer\\'s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane\\'s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we\\'ve done our work, so it\\'s time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\"\\n\\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James\\'s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.\\n\\n\"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,\" he remarked as we emerged.\\n\\n\"Yes, it would be as well.\"\\n\\n\"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious.\"\\n\\n\"Why serious?\"\\n\\n\"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.\"\\n\\n\"At what time?\"\\n\\n\"Ten will be early enough.\"\\n\\n\"I shall be at Baker Street at ten.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\" He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\\n\\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker\\'s assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.\\n\\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\\n\\n\"Ha! Our party is complete,\" said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. \"Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night\\'s adventure.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,\" said Jones in his consequential way. \"Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.\"\\n\\n\"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\" observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\\n\\n\"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,\" said the police agent loftily. \"He has his own little methods, which are, if he won\\'t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,\" said the stranger with deference. \"Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.\"\\n\\n\"I think you will find,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some $30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.\"\\n\\n\"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He\\'s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He\\'s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He\\'ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I\\'ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.\"\\n\\n\"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I\\'ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.\\n\\n\"We are close there now,\" my friend remarked. \"This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.\"\\n\\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\\n\\n\"You are not very vulnerable from above,\" Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.\\n\\n\"Nor from below,\" said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. \"Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\" he remarked, looking up in surprise.\\n\\n\"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\" said Holmes severely. \"You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\"\\n\\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\\n\\n\"We have at least an hour before us,\" he remarked, \"for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.\"\\n\\n\"It is our French gold,\" whispered the director. \"We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\"\\n\\n\"Your French gold?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.\"\\n\\n\"Which were very well justified,\" observed Holmes. \"And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.\"\\n\\n\"And sit in the dark?\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carree, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy\\'s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.\"\\n\\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment\\'s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\\n\\n\"They have but one retreat,\" whispered Holmes. \"That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?\"\\n\\n\"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\"\\n\\n\"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.\"\\n\\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\\n\\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\\n\\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all clear,\" he whispered. \"Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I\\'ll swing for it!\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes\\' hunting crop came down on the man\\'s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\\n\\n\"It\\'s no use, John Clay,\" said Holmes blandly. \"You have no chance at all.\"\\n\\n\"So I see,\" the other answered with the utmost coolness. \"I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.\"\\n\\n\"There are three men waiting for him at the door,\" said Holmes.\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you.\"\\n\\n\"And I you,\" Holmes answered. \"Your red-headed idea was very new and effective.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll see your pal again presently,\" said Jones. \"He\\'s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.\"\\n\\n\"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\" remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. \"You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say \\'sir\\' and \\'please.\\' \"\\n\\n\"All right,\" said Jones with a stare and a snigger. \"Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?\"\\n\\n\"That is better,\" said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\\n\\n\"Really, Mr. Holmes,\" said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, \"I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.\"\\n\\n\"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay,\" said Holmes. \"I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.\"\\n\\n\"You see, Watson,\" he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \"it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclopaedia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay\\'s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice\\'s hair. The $4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.\"\\n\\n\"But how could you guess what the motive was?\"\\n\\n\"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man\\'s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant\\'s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.\\n\\n\"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend\\'s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.\"\\n\\n\"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson\\'s presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.\"\\n\\n\"You reasoned it out beautifully,\" I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. \"It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.\"\\n\\n\"It saved me from ennui,\" he answered, yawning. \"Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.\"\\n\\n\"And you are a benefactor of the race,\" said I.\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,\" he remarked. \" \\'L\\'homme c\\'est rien--l\\'oeuvre c\\'est tout,\\' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.\"\\n\\nADVENTURE  III.  A CASE OF IDENTITY\\n\\n\\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, \"life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.\"\\n\\n\"And yet I am not convinced of it,\" I answered. \"The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.\"\\n\\n\"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,\" remarked Holmes. \"This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.\"\\n\\nI smiled and shook my head. \"I can quite understand your thinking so.\" I said. \"Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here\"--I picked up the morning paper from the ground--\"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. \\'A husband\\'s cruelty to his wife.\\' There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\" said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \"This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.\"\\n\\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.\"\\n\\n\"And the ring?\" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.\\n\\n\"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.\"\\n\\n\"And have you any on hand just now?\" I asked with interest.\\n\\n\"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.\"\\n\\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\\n\\n\"I have seen those symptoms before,\" said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. \"Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.\\n\\n\"Do you not find,\" he said, \"that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?\"\\n\\n\"I did at first,\" she answered, \"but now I know where the letters are without looking.\" Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. \"You\\'ve heard about me, Mr. Holmes,\" she cried, \"else how could you know all that?\"\\n\\n\"Never mind,\" said Holmes, laughing; \"it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?\"\\n\\n\"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I\\'m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\\n\\n\"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\" asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\\n\\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. \"Yes, I did bang out of the house,\" she said, \"for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you.\"\\n\\n\"Your father,\" said Holmes, \"your stepfather, surely, since the name is different.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.\"\\n\\n\"And your mother is alive?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn\\'t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father\\'s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got $4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn\\'t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.\"\\n\\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.\\n\\n\"Your own little income,\" he asked, \"does it come out of the business?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/4 per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.\"\\n\\n\"You interest me extremely,\" said Holmes. \"And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about $60.\"\\n\\n\"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don\\'t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.\"\\n\\n\"You have made your position very clear to me,\" said Holmes. \"This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\\n\\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland\\'s face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. \"I met him first at the gasfitters\\' ball,\" she said. \"They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father\\'s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose,\" said Holmes, \"that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.\"\\n\\n\"I see. Then at the gasfitters\\' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.\"\\n\\n\"No?\"\\n\\n\"Well, you know father didn\\'t like anything of the sort. He wouldn\\'t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.\"\\n\\n\"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?\"\\n\\n\"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.\"\\n\\n\"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--\"\\n\\n\"What office?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"Where did he live, then?\"\\n\\n\"He slept on the premises.\"\\n\\n\"And you don\\'t know his address?\"\\n\\n\"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street.\"\\n\\n\"Where did you address your letters, then?\"\\n\\n\"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn\\'t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.\"\\n\\n\"It was most suggestive,\" said Holmes. \"It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\"\\n\\n\"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He\\'d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn\\'t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn\\'t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.\"\\n\\n\"It missed him, then?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\"\\n\\n\"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour\\'s, near King\\'s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.\"\\n\\n\"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,\" said Holmes.\\n\\n\"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.\"\\n\\n\"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.\"\\n\\n\"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?\"\\n\\n\"None.\"\\n\\n\"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?\"\\n\\n\"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.\"\\n\\n\"And your father? Did you tell him?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can\\'t sleep a wink at night.\" She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.\\n\\n\"I shall glance into the case for you,\" said Holmes, rising, \"and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life.\"\\n\\n\"Then you don\\'t think I\\'ll see him again?\"\\n\\n\"I fear not.\"\\n\\n\"Then what has happened to him?\"\\n\\n\"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.\"\\n\\n\"I advertised for him in last Saturday\\'s Chronicle,\" said she. \"Here is the slip and here are four letters from him.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you. And your address?\"\\n\\n\"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Angel\\'s address you never had, I understand. Where is your father\\'s place of business?\"\\n\\n\"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.\"\\n\\n\"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.\"\\n\\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\\n\\n\"Quite an interesting study, that maiden,\" he observed. \"I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in \\'77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.\"\\n\\n\"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,\" I remarked.\\n\\n\"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman\\'s appearance? Describe it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn\\'t observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\\n\\n\" \\'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman\\'s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.\"\\n\\n\"It surprised me.\"\\n\\n\"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.\"\\n\\n\"And what else?\" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend\\'s incisive reasoning.\\n\\n\"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?\"\\n\\nI held the little printed slip to the light.\\n\\n\"Missing,\" it said, \"on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--\"\\n\\n\"That will do,\" said Holmes. \"As to the letters,\" he continued, glancing over them, \"they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.\"\\n\\n\"They are typewritten,\" I remarked.\\n\\n\"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little \\'Hosmer Angel\\' at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we may call it conclusive.\"\\n\\n\"Of what?\"\\n\\n\"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.\"\\n\\n\"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady\\'s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o\\'clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim.\"\\n\\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend\\'s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\\n\\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\\n\\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o\\'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the denouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\\n\\n\"Well, have you solved it?\" I asked as I entered.\\n\\n\"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, the mystery!\" I cried.\\n\\n\"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\"\\n\\n\"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?\"\\n\\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.\\n\\n\"This is the girl\\'s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,\" said Holmes. \"He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!\"\\n\\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\\n\\n\"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,\" said Holmes. \"I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o\\'clock?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary,\" said Holmes quietly; \"I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\\n\\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. \"I am delighted to hear it,\" he said.\\n\\n\"It is a curious thing,\" remarked Holmes, \"that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man\\'s handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the \\'e,\\' and a slight defect in the tail of the \\'r.\\' There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.\"\\n\\n\"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn,\" our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.\\n\\n\"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank,\" Holmes continued. \"I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the \\'e\\'s\\' slurred and the \\'r\\'s\\' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.\"\\n\\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. \"I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,\" he said. \"If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. \"I let you know, then, that I have caught him!\"\\n\\n\"What! where?\" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.\\n\\n\"Oh, it won\\'t do--really it won\\'t,\" said Holmes suavely. \"There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That\\'s right! Sit down and let us talk it over.\"\\n\\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. \"It--it\\'s not actionable,\" he stammered.\\n\\n\"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.\"\\n\\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\\n\\n\"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,\" said he, \"and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl\\'s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.\"\\n\\n\"It was only a joke at first,\" groaned our visitor. \"We never thought that she would have been so carried away.\"\\n\\n\"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman\\'s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl\\'s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady\\'s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!\"\\n\\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.\\n\\n\"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,\" said he, \"but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.\"\\n\\n\"The law cannot, as you say, touch you,\" said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, \"yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!\" he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man\\'s face, \"it is not part of my duties to my client, but here\\'s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to--\" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a cold-blooded scoundrel!\" said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. \"That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,\" I remarked.\\n\\n\"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.\"\\n\\n\"And how did you verify them?\"\\n\\n\"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employe, James Windibank. Voila tout!\"\\n\\n\"And Miss Sutherland?\"\\n\\n\"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, \\'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.\\' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.\"\\n\\nADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY\\n\\n\\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:\\n\\n\"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15.\"\\n\\n\"What do you say, dear?\" said my wife, looking across at me. \"Will you go?\"\\n\\n\"I really don\\'t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes\\' cases.\"\\n\\n\"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them,\" I answered. \"But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour.\"\\n\\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\\n\\n\"It is really very good of you to come, Watson,\" said he. \"It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.\"\\n\\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\\n\\n\"Have you heard anything of the case?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.\"\\n\\n\"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.\"\\n\\n\"That sounds a little paradoxical.\"\\n\\n\"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.\"\\n\\n\"It is a murder, then?\"\\n\\n\"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.\\n\\n\"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\\n\\n\"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.\\n\\n\"From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\\n\\n\"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son\\'s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of \\'wilful murder\\' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.\"\\n\\n\"I could hardly imagine a more damning case,\" I remarked. \"If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.\"\\n\\n\"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,\" answered Holmes thoughtfully. \"It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid,\" said I, \"that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case.\"\\n\\n\"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,\" he answered, laughing. \"Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that.\"\\n\\n\"How on earth--\"\\n\\n\"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my metier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.\"\\n\\n\"What are they?\"\\n\\n\"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner\\'s jury.\"\\n\\n\"It was a confession,\" I ejaculated.\\n\\n\"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\"\\n\\n\"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary,\" said Holmes, \"it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one.\"\\n\\nI shook my head. \"Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,\" I remarked.\\n\\n\"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.\"\\n\\n\"What is the young man\\'s own account of the matter?\"\\n\\n\"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.\"\\n\\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:\\n\\n\"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: \\'I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of \"Cooee!\" which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner\\'s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.\\'\\n\\n\"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\\n\\n\"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.\\n\\n\"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\\n\\n\"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\\n\\n\"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?\\n\\n\"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.\\n\\n\"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\\n\\n\"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\\n\\n\"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.\\n\\n\"Witness: I must still refuse.\\n\\n\"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of \\'Cooee\\' was a common signal between you and your father?\\n\\n\"Witness: It was.\\n\\n\"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\\n\\n\"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\\n\\n\"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\\n\\n\"Witness: Nothing definite.\\n\\n\"The Coroner: What do you mean?\\n\\n\"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.\\n\\n\" \\'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Yes, it was gone.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'You cannot say what it was?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'No, I had a feeling something was there.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'How far from the body?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'A dozen yards or so.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'And how far from the edge of the wood?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'About the same.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Yes, but with my back towards it.\\'\\n\\n\"This concluded the examination of the witness.\"\\n\\n\"I see,\" said I as I glanced down the column, \"that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father\\'s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.\"\\n\\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. \"Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,\" said he, \"to single out the very strongest points in the young man\\'s favour. Don\\'t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.\"\\n\\nIt was nearly four o\\'clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.\\n\\n\"I have ordered a carriage,\" said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. \"I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.\"\\n\\n\"It was very nice and complimentary of you,\" Holmes answered. \"It is entirely a question of barometric pressure.\"\\n\\nLestrade looked startled. \"I do not quite follow,\" he said.\\n\\n\"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.\"\\n\\nLestrade laughed indulgently. \"You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers,\" he said. \"The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can\\'t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.\"\\n\\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\\n\\n\"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\" she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman\\'s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, \"I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn\\'t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.\"\\n\\n\"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"You may rely upon my doing all that I can.\"\\n\\n\"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?\"\\n\\n\"I think that it is very probable.\"\\n\\n\"There, now!\" she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. \"You hear! He gives me hopes.\"\\n\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \"I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,\" he said.\\n\\n\"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.\"\\n\\n\"In what way?\" asked Holmes.\\n\\n\"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.\"\\n\\n\"And your father?\" asked Holmes. \"Was he in favour of such a union?\"\\n\\n\"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it.\" A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\\n\\n\"Thank you for this information,\" said he. \"May I see your father if I call to-morrow?\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid the doctor won\\'t allow it.\"\\n\\n\"The doctor?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.\"\\n\\n\"Ha! In Victoria! That is important.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, at the mines.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.\"\\n\\n\"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent.\"\\n\\n\"I will, Miss Turner.\"\\n\\n\"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\" She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\\n\\n\"I am ashamed of you, Holmes,\" said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes\\' silence. \"Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.\"\\n\\n\"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\" said Holmes. \"Have you an order to see him in prison?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but only for you and me.\"\\n\\n\"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\"\\n\\n\"Ample.\"\\n\\n\"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.\"\\n\\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man\\'s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon\\'s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes\\' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade\\'s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes\\' insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy\\'s innocence.\\n\\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\\n\\n\"The glass still keeps very high,\" he remarked as he sat down. \"It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.\"\\n\\n\"And what did you learn from him?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Could he throw no light?\"\\n\\n\"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot admire his taste,\" I remarked, \"if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered.\"\\n\\n\"But if he is innocent, who has done it?\"\\n\\n\"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry \\'Cooee!\\' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.\"\\n\\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o\\'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\\n\\n\"There is serious news this morning,\" Lestrade observed. \"It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.\"\\n\\n\"An elderly man, I presume?\" said Holmes.\\n\\n\"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy\\'s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed! That is interesting,\" said Holmes.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.\"\\n\\n\"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner\\'s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?\"\\n\\n\"We have got to the deductions and the inferences,\" said Lestrade, winking at me. \"I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.\"\\n\\n\"You are right,\" said Holmes demurely; \"you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.\"\\n\\n\"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,\" replied Lestrade with some warmth.\\n\\n\"And that is--\"\\n\\n\"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\"\\n\\n\"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\" said Holmes, laughing. \"But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that is it.\" It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes\\' request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son\\'s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.\\n\\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner\\'s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\\n\\n\"What did you go into the pool for?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet.\" He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. \"These are young McCarthy\\'s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father\\'s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?\" He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.\\n\\n\"It has been a case of considerable interest,\" he remarked, returning to his natural manner. \"I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.\"\\n\\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.\\n\\n\"This may interest you, Lestrade,\" he remarked, holding it out. \"The murder was done with it.\"\\n\\n\"I see no marks.\"\\n\\n\"There are none.\"\\n\\n\"How do you know, then?\"\\n\\n\"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.\"\\n\\n\"And the murderer?\"\\n\\n\"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.\"\\n\\nLestrade laughed. \"I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\" he said. \"Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.\"\\n\\n\"Nous verrons,\" answered Holmes calmly. \"You work your own method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train.\"\\n\\n\"And leave your case unfinished?\"\\n\\n\"No, finished.\"\\n\\n\"But the mystery?\"\\n\\n\"It is solved.\"\\n\\n\"Who was the criminal, then?\"\\n\\n\"The gentleman I describe.\"\\n\\n\"But who is he?\"\\n\\n\"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood.\"\\n\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \"I am a practical man,\" he said, \"and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" said Holmes quietly. \"I have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.\"\\n\\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.\\n\\n\"Look here, Watson,\" he said when the cloth was cleared \"just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don\\'t know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound.\"\\n\\n\"Pray do so.\"\\n\\n\"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy\\'s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry \\'Cooee!\\' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son\\'s ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\"\\n\\n\"What of this \\'Cooee!\\' then?\"\\n\\n\"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The \\'Cooee!\\' was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But \\'Cooee\\' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.\"\\n\\n\"What of the rat, then?\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. \"This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\" he said. \"I wired to Bristol for it last night.\" He put his hand over part of the map. \"What do you read?\"\\n\\n\"ARAT,\" I read.\\n\\n\"And now?\" He raised his hand.\\n\\n\"BALLARAT.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.\"\\n\\n\"It is wonderful!\" I exclaimed.\\n\\n\"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son\\'s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\\n\"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so.\"\\n\\n\"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.\"\\n\\n\"But how did you gain them?\"\\n\\n\"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.\"\\n\\n\"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, they were peculiar boots.\"\\n\\n\"But his lameness?\"\\n\\n\"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he was lame.\"\\n\\n\"But his left-handedness.\"\\n\\n\"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam.\"\\n\\n\"And the cigar-holder?\"\\n\\n\"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\"\\n\\n\"Holmes,\" I said, \"you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this points. The culprit is--\"\\n\\n\"Mr. John Turner,\" cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\\n\\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.\\n\\n\"Pray sit down on the sofa,\" said Holmes gently. \"You had my note?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.\"\\n\\n\"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\"\\n\\n\"And why did you wish to see me?\" He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. \"It is so. I know all about McCarthy.\"\\n\\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. \"God help me!\" he cried. \"But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad to hear you say so,\" said Holmes gravely.\\n\\n\"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.\"\\n\\n\"It may not come to that,\" said Holmes.\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however.\"\\n\\n\"I am a dying man,\" said old Turner. \"I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.\"\\n\\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. \"Just tell us the truth,\" he said. \"I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s as well,\" said the old man; \"it\\'s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I\\'ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\\n\\n\"It was in the early \\'60\\'s at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\\n\\n\"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\\n\\n\"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\\n\\n\" \\'Here we are, Jack,\\' says he, touching me on the arm; \\'we\\'ll be as good as a family to you. There\\'s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don\\'t--it\\'s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there\\'s always a policeman within hail.\\'\\n\\n\"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\\n\\n\"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\\n\\n\"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it is not for me to judge you,\" said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. \"I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation.\"\\n\\n\"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?\"\\n\\n\"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.\"\\n\\n\"Farewell, then,\" said the old man solemnly. \"Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine.\" Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.\\n\\n\"God help us!\" said Holmes after a long silence. \"Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter\\'s words, and say, \\'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.\\' \"\\n\\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.\\n\\nADVENTURE  V.  THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS\\n\\n\\nWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years \\'82 and \\'90, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.\\n\\nThe year \\'87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man\\'s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.\\n\\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell\\'s fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother\\'s, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.\\n\\n\"Why,\" said I, glancing up at my companion, \"that was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?\"\\n\\n\"Except yourself I have none,\" he answered. \"I do not encourage visitors.\"\\n\\n\"A client, then?\"\\n\\n\"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady\\'s.\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.\\n\\n\"Come in!\" said he.\\n\\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.\\n\\n\"I owe you an apology,\" he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. \"I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.\"\\n\\n\"Give me your coat and umbrella,\" said Holmes. \"They may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, from Horsham.\"\\n\\n\"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive.\"\\n\\n\"I have come for advice.\"\\n\\n\"That is easily got.\"\\n\\n\"And help.\"\\n\\n\"That is not always so easy.\"\\n\\n\"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.\"\\n\\n\"He said that you could solve anything.\"\\n\\n\"He said too much.\"\\n\\n\"That you are never beaten.\"\\n\\n\"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a woman.\"\\n\\n\"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?\"\\n\\n\"It is true that I have been generally successful.\"\\n\\n\"Then you may be so with me.\"\\n\\n\"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case.\"\\n\\n\"It is no ordinary one.\"\\n\\n\"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.\"\\n\\n\"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family.\"\\n\\n\"You fill me with interest,\" said Holmes. \"Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important.\"\\n\\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.\\n\\n\"My name,\" said he, \"is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.\\n\\n\"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\\n\\n\"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson\\'s army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.\\n\\n\"He didn\\'t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy\\'s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.\\n\\n\"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel\\'s plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. \\'From India!\\' said he as he took it up, \\'Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?\\' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, \\'K. K. K.!\\' he shrieked, and then, \\'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!\\'\\n\\n\" \\'What is it, uncle?\\' I cried.\\n\\n\" \\'Death,\\' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\\n\\n\" \\'They may do what they like, but I\\'ll checkmate them still,\\' said he with an oath. \\'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\\'\\n\\n\"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.\\n\\n\" \\'I wish you, John,\\' said my uncle, \\'to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can\\'t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.\\'\\n\\n\"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\\n\\n\"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of \\'suicide.\\' But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some $14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.\"\\n\\n\"One moment,\" Holmes interposed, \"your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.\"\\n\\n\"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you. Pray proceed.\"\\n\\n\"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and \\'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register\\' written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle\\'s life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.\\n\\n\"Well, it was the beginning of \\'84 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of \\'85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.\\n\\n\" \\'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?\\' he stammered.\\n\\n\"My heart had turned to lead. \\'It is K. K. K.,\\' said I.\\n\\n\"He looked inside the envelope. \\'So it is,\\' he cried. \\'Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Put the papers on the sundial,\\' I read, peeping over his shoulder.\\n\\n\" \\'What papers? What sundial?\\' he asked.\\n\\n\" \\'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,\\' said I; \\'but the papers must be those that are destroyed.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Pooh!\\' said he, gripping hard at his courage. \\'We are in a civilised land here, and we can\\'t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'From Dundee,\\' I answered, glancing at the postmark.\\n\\n\" \\'Some preposterous practical joke,\\' said he. \\'What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'I should certainly speak to the police,\\' I said.\\n\\n\" \\'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Then let me do so?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'No, I forbid you. I won\\'t have a fuss made about such nonsense.\\'\\n\\n\"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\\n\\n\"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of \\'death from accidental causes.\\' Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\\n\\n\"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle\\'s life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.\\n\\n\"It was in January, \\'85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.\"\\n\\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\\n\\n\"This is the envelope,\" he continued. \"The postmark is London--eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father\\'s last message: \\'K. K. K.\\'; and then \\'Put the papers on the sundial.\\' \"\\n\\n\"What have you done?\" asked Holmes.\\n\\n\"Nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing?\"\\n\\n\"To tell the truth\"--he sank his face into his thin, white hands--\"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.\"\\n\\n\"Tut! tut!\" cried Sherlock Holmes. \"You must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.\"\\n\\n\"I have seen the police.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\"\\n\\n\"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.\"\\n\\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. \"Incredible imbecility!\" he cried.\\n\\n\"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.\"\\n\\n\"Has he come with you to-night?\"\\n\\n\"No. His orders were to stay in the house.\"\\n\\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\\n\\n\"Why did you come to me,\" he cried, \"and, above all, why did you not come at once?\"\\n\\n\"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.\"\\n\\n\"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which might help us?\"\\n\\n\"There is one thing,\" said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. \"I have some remembrance,\" said he, \"that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle\\'s.\"\\n\\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, \"March, 1869,\" and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:\\n\\n\"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\\n\\n\"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and\\n\\n        John Swain, of St. Augustine.\\n\\n\"9th. McCauley cleared.\\n\\n\"10th. John Swain cleared.\\n\\n\"12th. Visited Paramore. All well.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you!\" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. \"And now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home instantly and act.\"\\n\\n\"What shall I do?\"\\n\\n\"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n\"Entirely.\"\\n\\n\"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you,\" said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. \"You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise.\"\\n\\n\"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?\"\\n\\n\"By train from Waterloo.\"\\n\\n\"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.\"\\n\\n\"I am armed.\"\\n\\n\"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.\"\\n\\n\"I shall see you at Horsham, then?\"\\n\\n\"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.\"\\n\\n\"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.\" He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.\\n\\n\"I think, Watson,\" he remarked at last, \"that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.\"\\n\\n\"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.\"\\n\\n\"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.\"\\n\\n\"But have you,\" I asked, \"formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?\"\\n\\n\"There can be no question as to their nature,\" he answered.\\n\\n\"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. \"The ideal reasoner,\" he remarked, \"would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I answered, laughing. \"It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis.\"\\n\\nHolmes grinned at the last item. \"Well,\" he said, \"I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?\"\\n\\n\"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London.\"\\n\\n\"From East London. What do you deduce from that?\"\\n\\n\"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.\"\\n\\n\"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?\"\\n\\n\"A greater distance to travel.\"\\n\\n\"But the letter had also a greater distance to come.\"\\n\\n\"Then I do not see the point.\"\\n\\n\"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer.\"\\n\\n\"It is possible.\"\\n\\n\"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.\"\\n\\n\"Good God!\" I cried. \"What can it mean, this relentless persecution?\"\\n\\n\"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner\\'s jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.\"\\n\\n\"But of what society?\"\\n\\n\"Have you never--\" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice--\"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\"\\n\\n\"I never have.\"\\n\\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. \"Here it is,\" said he presently:\\n\\n\" \\'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.\\'\\n\\n\"You will observe,\" said Holmes, laying down the volume, \"that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.\"\\n\\n\"Then the page we have seen--\"\\n\\n\"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, \\'sent the pips to A, B, and C\\'--that is, sent the society\\'s warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men.\"\\n\\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\\n\\n\"You will excuse me for not waiting for you,\" said he; \"I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"What steps will you take?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have to go down to Horsham, after all.\"\\n\\n\"You will not go there first?\"\\n\\n\"No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee.\"\\n\\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.\\n\\n\"Holmes,\" I cried, \"you are too late.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said he, laying down his cup, \"I feared as much. How was it done?\" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\\n\\n\"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading \\'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.\\' Here is the account:\\n\\n\" \\'Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.\\' \"\\n\\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.\\n\\n\"That hurts my pride, Watson,\" he said at last. \"It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death--!\" He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.\\n\\n\"They must be cunning devils,\" he exclaimed at last. \"How could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!\"\\n\\n\"To the police?\"\\n\\n\"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before.\"\\n\\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o\\'clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.\\n\\n\"You are hungry,\" I remarked.\\n\\n\"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.\"\\n\\n\"And how have you succeeded?\"\\n\\n\"Well.\"\\n\\n\"You have a clue?\"\\n\\n\"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote \"S. H. for J. O.\" Then he sealed it and addressed it to \"Captain James Calhoun, Barque Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia.\"\\n\\n\"That will await him when he enters port,\" said he, chuckling. \"It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.\"\\n\\n\"And who is this Captain Calhoun?\"\\n\\n\"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.\"\\n\\n\"How did you trace it, then?\"\\n\\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.\\n\\n\"I have spent the whole day,\" said he, \"over Lloyd\\'s registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in \\'83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union.\"\\n\\n\"Texas, I think.\"\\n\\n\"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin.\"\\n\\n\"What then?\"\\n\\n\"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January, \\'85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London.\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\\n\"The Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.\"\\n\\n\"What will you do, then?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.\"\\n\\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the Lone Star of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters \"L. S.\" carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone Star.\\n\\nADVENTURE  VI.  THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP\\n\\n\\nIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. George\\'s, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey\\'s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\\n\\nOne night--it was in June, \\'89--there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.\\n\\n\"A patient!\" said she. \"You\\'ll have to go out.\"\\n\\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\\n\\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\\n\\n\"You will excuse my calling so late,\" she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife\\'s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. \"Oh, I\\'m in such trouble!\" she cried; \"I do so want a little help.\"\\n\\n\"Why,\" said my wife, pulling up her veil, \"it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know what to do, so I came straight to you.\" That was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.\\n\\n\"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor\\'s advice and help, too. It\\'s about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!\"\\n\\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband\\'s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?\\n\\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\\n\\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney\\'s medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.\\n\\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.\\n\\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.\\n\\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\\n\\n\"Thank you. I have not come to stay,\" said I. \"There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.\"\\n\\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.\\n\\n\"My God! It\\'s Watson,\" said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. \"I say, Watson, what o\\'clock is it?\"\\n\\n\"Nearly eleven.\"\\n\\n\"Of what day?\"\\n\\n\"Of Friday, June 19th.\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d\\'you want to frighten a chap for?\" He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.\\n\\n\"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!\"\\n\\n\"So I am. But you\\'ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I\\'ll go home with you. I wouldn\\'t frighten Kate--poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have one waiting.\"\\n\\n\"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.\"\\n\\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, \"Walk past me, and then look back at me.\" The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.\\n\\n\"Holmes!\" I whispered, \"what on earth are you doing in this den?\"\\n\\n\"As low as you can,\" he answered; \"I have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.\"\\n\\n\"I have a cab outside.\"\\n\\n\"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.\"\\n\\nIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes\\' requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney\\'s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.\\n\\n\"I suppose, Watson,\" said he, \"that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.\"\\n\\n\"I was certainly surprised to find you there.\"\\n\\n\"But not more so than I to find you.\"\\n\\n\"I came to find a friend.\"\\n\\n\"And I to find an enemy.\"\\n\\n\"An enemy?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour\\'s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul\\'s Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.\"\\n\\n\"What! You do not mean bodies?\"\\n\\n\"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had $1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.\" He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses\\' hoofs.\\n\\n\"Now, Watson,\" said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. \"You\\'ll come with me, won\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"If I can be of use.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.\"\\n\\n\"The Cedars?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair\\'s house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.\"\\n\\n\"Where is it, then?\"\\n\\n\"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.\"\\n\\n\"But I am all in the dark.\"\\n\\n\"Of course you are. You\\'ll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here\\'s half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!\"\\n\\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\\n\\n\"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,\" said he. \"It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. \\'Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.\"\\n\\n\"You forget that I know nothing about it.\"\\n\\n\"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There\\'s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can\\'t get the end of it into my hand. Now, I\\'ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.\"\\n\\n\"Proceed, then.\"\\n\\n\"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to $88 10s., while he has $220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.\\n\\n\"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company\\'s office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?\"\\n\\n\"It is very clear.\"\\n\\n\"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\\n\\n\"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night--and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children\\'s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.\\n\\n\"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.\\n\\n\"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair\\'s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband\\'s appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman\\'s clothes.\\n\\n\"So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.\"\\n\\n\"But a cripple!\" said I. \"What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?\"\\n\\n\"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.\"\\n\\n\"Pray continue your narrative.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair\\'s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\\n\\n\"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair\\'s coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found in the pockets?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot imagine.\"\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.\"\\n\\n\"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat\\'s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.\"\\n\\n\"It certainly sounds feasible.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.\"\\n\\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\\n\\n\"We are on the outskirts of Lee,\" said my companion. \"We have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse\\'s feet.\"\\n\\n\"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!\"\\n\\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse\\'s head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.\\n\\n\"Well?\" she cried, \"well?\" And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\"No good news?\"\\n\\n\"None.\"\\n\\n\"No bad?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day.\"\\n\\n\"This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation.\"\\n\\n\"I am delighted to see you,\" said she, pressing my hand warmly. \"You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.\"\\n\\n\"My dear madam,\" said I, \"I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.\"\\n\\n\"Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, \"I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, madam.\"\\n\\n\"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.\"\\n\\n\"Upon what point?\"\\n\\n\"In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. \"Frankly, now!\" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\\n\\n\"Frankly, then, madam, I do not.\"\\n\\n\"You think that he is dead?\"\\n\\n\"I do.\"\\n\\n\"Murdered?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t say that. Perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"And on what day did he meet his death?\"\\n\\n\"On Monday.\"\\n\\n\"Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day.\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\\n\\n\"What!\" he roared.\\n\\n\"Yes, to-day.\" She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.\\n\\n\"May I see it?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.\\n\\n\"Coarse writing,\" murmured Holmes. \"Surely this is not your husband\\'s writing, madam.\"\\n\\n\"No, but the enclosure is.\"\\n\\n\"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.\"\\n\\n\"How can you tell that?\"\\n\\n\"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.\"\\n\\n\"And you are sure that this is your husband\\'s hand?\"\\n\\n\"One of his hands.\"\\n\\n\"One?\"\\n\\n\"His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well.\"\\n\\n\" \\'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.\\' Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband\\'s hand, madam?\"\\n\\n\"None. Neville wrote those words.\"\\n\\n\"And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over.\"\\n\\n\"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.\"\\n\\n\"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.\"\\n\\n\"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!\"\\n\\n\"Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day.\"\\n\\n\"That is possible.\"\\n\\n\"If so, much may have happened between.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?\"\\n\\n\"I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.\"\\n\\n\"And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?\"\\n\\n\"Very much so.\"\\n\\n\"Was the window open?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Then he might have called to you?\"\\n\\n\"He might.\"\\n\\n\"He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"A call for help, you thought?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. He waved his hands.\"\\n\\n\"But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?\"\\n\\n\"It is possible.\"\\n\\n\"And you thought he was pulled back?\"\\n\\n\"He disappeared so suddenly.\"\\n\\n\"He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?\"\\n\\n\"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?\"\\n\\n\"But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.\"\\n\\n\"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?\"\\n\\n\"Never.\"\\n\\n\"Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?\"\\n\\n\"Never.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.\"\\n\\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\\n\\n\"Awake, Watson?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Game for a morning drive?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\\n\"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.\" He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.\\n\\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\\n\\n\"I want to test a little theory of mine,\" said he, pulling on his boots. \"I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.\"\\n\\n\"And where is it?\" I asked, smiling.\\n\\n\"In the bathroom,\" he answered. \"Oh, yes, I am not joking,\" he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. \"I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.\"\\n\\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\\n\\n\"It has been in some points a singular case,\" said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. \"I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.\"\\n\\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse\\'s head while the other led us in.\\n\\n\"Who is on duty?\" asked Holmes.\\n\\n\"Inspector Bradstreet, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?\" A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. \"I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.\" \"Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.\" It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.\\n\\n\"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?\"\\n\\n\"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.\"\\n\\n\"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.\"\\n\\n\"So I heard. You have him here?\"\\n\\n\"In the cells.\"\\n\\n\"Is he quiet?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.\"\\n\\n\"Dirty?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker\\'s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.\"\\n\\n\"I should like to see him very much.\"\\n\\n\"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.\"\\n\\n\"No, I think that I\\'ll take it.\"\\n\\n\"Very good. Come this way, if you please.\" He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\\n\\n\"The third on the right is his,\" said the inspector. \"Here it is!\" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.\\n\\n\"He is asleep,\" said he. \"You can see him very well.\"\\n\\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\\n\\n\"He\\'s a beauty, isn\\'t he?\" said the inspector.\\n\\n\"He certainly needs a wash,\" remarked Holmes. \"I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.\" He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.\\n\\n\"He! he! You are a funny one,\" chuckled the inspector.\\n\\n\"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know why not,\" said the inspector. \"He doesn\\'t look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?\" He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner\\'s face.\\n\\n\"Let me introduce you,\" he shouted, \"to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.\"\\n\\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man\\'s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\\n\\n\"Great heavens!\" cried the inspector, \"it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the photograph.\"\\n\\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. \"Be it so,\" said he. \"And pray what am I charged with?\"\\n\\n\"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can\\'t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,\" said the inspector with a grin. \"Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.\"\\n\\n\"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.\"\\n\\n\"No crime, but a very great error has been committed,\" said Holmes. \"You would have done better to have trusted you wife.\"\\n\\n\"It was not the wife; it was the children,\" groaned the prisoner. \"God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.\\n\\n\"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,\" said he, \"of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.\"\\n\\n\"God bless you!\" cried the prisoner passionately. \"I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.\\n\\n\"You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.\\n\\n\"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for $25. I was at my wit\\'s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight\\'s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\\n\\n\"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at $2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\\n\\n\"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn $700 a year--which is less than my average takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take $2.\\n\\n\"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.\\n\\n\"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife\\'s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.\\n\\n\"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.\"\\n\\n\"That note only reached her yesterday,\" said Holmes.\\n\\n\"Good God! What a week she must have spent!\"\\n\\n\"The police have watched this Lascar,\" said Inspector Bradstreet, \"and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.\"\\n\\n\"That was it,\" said Holmes, nodding approvingly; \"I have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?\"\\n\\n\"Many times; but what was a fine to me?\"\\n\\n\"It must stop here, however,\" said Bradstreet. \"If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.\"\\n\\n\"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.\"\\n\\n\"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.\"\\n\\n\"I reached this one,\" said my friend, \"by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.\"\\n\\nVII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE\\n\\n\\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\\n\\n\"You are engaged,\" said I; \"perhaps I interrupt you.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one\"--he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat--\"but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.\"\\n\\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. \"I suppose,\" I remarked, \"that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.\"\\n\\n\"No, no. No crime,\" said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \"Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such.\"\\n\\n\"So much so,\" I remarked, \"that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.\"\\n\\n\"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"It is to him that this trophy belongs.\"\\n\\n\"It is his hat.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson\\'s fire. The facts are these: about four o\\'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man\\'s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.\"\\n\\n\"Which surely he restored to their owner?\"\\n\\n\"My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that \\'For Mrs. Henry Baker\\' was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird\\'s left leg, and it is also true that the initials \\'H. B.\\' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.\"\\n\\n\"What, then, did Peterson do?\"\\n\\n\"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.\"\\n\\n\"Did he not advertise?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?\"\\n\\n\"Only as much as we can deduce.\"\\n\\n\"From his hat?\"\\n\\n\"Precisely.\"\\n\\n\"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?\"\\n\\n\"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?\"\\n\\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker\\'s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials \"H. B.\" were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\\n\\n\"I can see nothing,\" said I, handing it back to my friend.\\n\\n\"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.\"\\n\\n\"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?\"\\n\\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. \"It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,\" he remarked, \"and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Holmes!\"\\n\\n\"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,\" he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. \"He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.\"\\n\\n\"You are certainly joking, Holmes.\"\\n\\n\"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?\"\\n\\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. \"It is a question of cubic capacity,\" said he; \"a man with so large a brain must have something in it.\"\\n\\n\"The decline of his fortunes, then?\"\\n\\n\"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes laughed. \"Here is the foresight,\" said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. \"They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.\"\\n\\n\"Your reasoning is certainly plausible.\"\\n\\n\"The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.\"\\n\\n\"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him.\"\\n\\n\"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week\\'s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife\\'s affection.\"\\n\\n\"But he might be a bachelor.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird\\'s leg.\"\\n\\n\"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?\"\\n\\n\"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?\"\\n\\n\"Well, it is very ingenious,\" said I, laughing; \"but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\\n\\n\"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!\" he gasped.\\n\\n\"Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?\" Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man\\'s excited face.\\n\\n\"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!\" He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. \"By Jove, Peterson!\" said he, \"this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?\"\\n\\n\"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone.\"\\n\\n\"Not the Countess of Morcar\\'s blue carbuncle!\" I ejaculated.\\n\\n\"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of $1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.\"\\n\\n\"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!\" The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\\n\\n\"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.\"\\n\\n\"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,\" I remarked.\\n\\n\"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady\\'s jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.\" He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\\n\\n\"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder\\'s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court.\"\\n\\n\"Hum! So much for the police-court,\" said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. \"The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.\"\\n\\n\"What will you say?\"\\n\\n\"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: \\'Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.\\' That is clear and concise.\"\\n\\n\"Very. But will he see it?\"\\n\\n\"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers.\"\\n\\n\"In which, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James\\'s, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, sir. And this stone?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.\"\\n\\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. \"It\\'s a bonny thing,\" said he. \"Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil\\'s pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I\\'ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot tell.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?\"\\n\\n\"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.\"\\n\\n\"And you can do nothing until then?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing.\"\\n\\n\"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.\"\\n\\n\"Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.\"\\n\\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes\\' room.\\n\\n\"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,\" said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. \"Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.\"\\n\\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes\\' surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\\n\\n\"We have retained these things for some days,\" said Holmes, \"because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.\"\\n\\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. \"Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,\" he remarked. \"I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.\"\\n\\n\"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.\"\\n\\n\"To eat it!\" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\\n\\n\"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, certainly, certainly,\" answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\\n\\n\"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish--\"\\n\\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. \"They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,\" said he, \"but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.\\n\\n\"There is your hat, then, and there your bird,\" said he. \"By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, sir,\" said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. \"There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.\" With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\\n\\n\"So much for Mr. Henry Baker,\" said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. \"It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?\"\\n\\n\"Not particularly.\"\\n\\n\"Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot.\"\\n\\n\"By all means.\"\\n\\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors\\' quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\\n\\n\"Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,\" said he.\\n\\n\"My geese!\" The man seemed surprised.\\n\\n\"Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them\\'s not our geese.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed! Whose, then?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?\"\\n\\n\"Breckinridge is his name.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! I don\\'t know him. Well, here\\'s your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night.\"\\n\\n\"Now for Mr. Breckinridge,\" he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. \"Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years\\' penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!\"\\n\\nWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.\\n\\n\"Good-evening. It\\'s a cold night,\" said Holmes.\\n\\nThe salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\\n\\n\"Sold out of geese, I see,\" continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.\\n\\n\"Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s no good.\"\\n\\n\"Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, but I was recommended to you.\"\\n\\n\"Who by?\"\\n\\n\"The landlord of the Alpha.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.\"\\n\\n\"Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?\"\\n\\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\\n\\n\"Now, then, mister,\" said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, \"what are you driving at? Let\\'s have it straight, now.\"\\n\\n\"It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.\"\\n\\n\"Well then, I shan\\'t tell you. So now!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don\\'t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.\"\\n\\n\"Warm! You\\'d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it\\'s \\'Where are the geese?\\' and \\'Who did you sell the geese to?\\' and \\'What will you take for the geese?\\' One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,\" said Holmes carelessly. \"If you won\\'t tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I\\'m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, you\\'ve lost your fiver, for it\\'s town bred,\" snapped the salesman.\\n\\n\"It\\'s nothing of the kind.\"\\n\\n\"I say it is.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe it.\"\\n\\n\"D\\'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll never persuade me to believe that.\"\\n\\n\"Will you bet, then?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I\\'ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.\"\\n\\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. \"Bring me the books, Bill,\" said he.\\n\\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\\n\\n\"Now then, Mr. Cocksure,\" said the salesman, \"I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you\\'ll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?\"\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D\\'you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249,\" read Holmes.\\n\\n\"Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.\"\\n\\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. \"Here you are, \\'Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.\\' \"\\n\\n\"Now, then, what\\'s the last entry?\"\\n\\n\" \\'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.\\' \"\\n\\n\"Quite so. There you are. And underneath?\"\\n\\n\" \\'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.\\' \"\\n\\n\"What have you to say now?\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.\\n\\n\"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the \\'Pink \\'un\\' protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,\" said he. \"I daresay that if I had put $100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should--\"\\n\\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve had enough of you and your geese,\" he shouted. \"I wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I\\'ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I\\'ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?\"\\n\\n\"No; but one of them was mine all the same,\" whined the little man.\\n\\n\"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.\"\\n\\n\"She told me to ask you.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I\\'ve had enough of it. Get out of this!\" He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.\\n\\n\"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,\" whispered Holmes. \"Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.\" Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.\\n\\n\"Who are you, then? What do you want?\" he asked in a quavering voice.\\n\\n\"You will excuse me,\" said Holmes blandly, \"but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you.\"\\n\\n\"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?\"\\n\\n\"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"But you can know nothing of this?\"\\n\\n\"Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,\" cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. \"I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. \"In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,\" said he. \"But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.\"\\n\\nThe man hesitated for an instant. \"My name is John Robinson,\" he answered with a sidelong glance.\\n\\n\"No, no; the real name,\" said Holmes sweetly. \"It is always awkward doing business with an alias.\"\\n\\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. \"Well then,\" said he, \"my real name is James Ryder.\"\\n\\n\"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.\"\\n\\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.\\n\\n\"Here we are!\" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. \"The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the tail.\"\\n\\nRyder quivered with emotion. \"Oh, sir,\" he cried, \"can you tell me where it went to?\"\\n\\n\"It came here.\"\\n\\n\"Here?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don\\'t wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum.\"\\n\\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.\\n\\n\"The game\\'s up, Ryder,\" said Holmes quietly. \"Hold up, man, or you\\'ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He\\'s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!\"\\n\\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.\\n\\n\"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar\\'s?\"\\n\\n\"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,\" said he in a crackling voice.\\n\\n\"I see--her ladyship\\'s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady\\'s room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then--\"\\n\\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion\\'s knees. \"For God\\'s sake, have mercy!\" he shrieked. \"Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I\\'ll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don\\'t bring it into court! For Christ\\'s sake, don\\'t!\"\\n\\n\"Get back into your chair!\" said Holmes sternly. \"It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.\"\\n\\n\"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down.\"\\n\\n\"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.\"\\n\\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. \"I will tell you it just as it happened, sir,\" said he. \"When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister\\'s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\\n\\n\"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\\n\\n\"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.\\n\\n\" \\'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?\\' says she.\\n\\n\" \\'Well,\\' said I, \\'you said you\\'d give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Oh,\\' says she, \\'we\\'ve set yours aside for you--Jem\\'s bird, we call it. It\\'s the big white one over yonder. There\\'s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Thank you, Maggie,\\' says I; \\'but if it is all the same to you, I\\'d rather have that one I was handling just now.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'The other is a good three pound heavier,\\' said she, \\'and we fattened it expressly for you.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Never mind. I\\'ll have the other, and I\\'ll take it now,\\' said I.\\n\\n\" \\'Oh, just as you like,\\' said she, a little huffed. \\'Which is it you want, then?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.\\'\\n\\n\"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister\\'s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\\n\\n\" \\'Where are they all, Maggie?\\' I cried.\\n\\n\" \\'Gone to the dealer\\'s, Jem.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Which dealer\\'s?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'But was there another with a barred tail?\\' I asked, \\'the same as the one I chose?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.\\'\\n\\n\"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!\" He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.\\n\\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes\\' finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\\n\\n\"Get out!\" said he.\\n\\n\"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!\"\\n\\n\"No more words. Get out!\"\\n\\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.\\n\\n\"After all, Watson,\" said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, \"I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature.\"\\n\\nVIII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND\\n\\n\\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.\\n\\nIt was early in April in the year \\'83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\\n\\n\"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,\" said he, \"but it\\'s the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.\"\\n\\n\"What is it, then--a fire?\"\\n\\n\"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.\"\\n\\n\"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\"\\n\\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\\n\\n\"Good-morning, madam,\" said Holmes cheerily. \"My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.\"\\n\\n\"It is not cold which makes me shiver,\" said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.\\n\\n\"What, then?\"\\n\\n\"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.\" She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\\n\\n\"You must not fear,\" said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. \"We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.\"\\n\\n\"You know me, then?\"\\n\\n\"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.\"\\n\\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\\n\\n\"There is no mystery, my dear madam,\" said he, smiling. \"The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.\"\\n\\n\"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,\" said she. \"I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.\"\\n\\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.\\n\\n\"Farintosh,\" said he. \"Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.\"\\n\\n\"Alas!\" replied our visitor, \"the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.\"\\n\\n\"I am all attention, madam.\"\\n\\n\"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.\"\\n\\nHolmes nodded his head. \"The name is familiar to me,\" said he.\\n\\n\"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.\\n\\n\"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother\\'s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money--not less than $1000 a year--and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\\n\\n\"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather\\'s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\\n\\n\"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.\\n\\n\"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.\"\\n\\n\"Your sister is dead, then?\"\\n\\n\"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother\\'s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady\\'s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.\\n\\n\"Pray be precise as to details,\" said he.\\n\\n\"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott\\'s, the second my sister\\'s, and the third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?\"\\n\\n\"Perfectly so.\"\\n\\n\"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o\\'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.\\n\\n\" \\'Tell me, Helen,\\' said she, \\'have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Never,\\' said I.\\n\\n\" \\'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Certainly not. But why?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.\\' She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" said Holmes. \"Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?\"\\n\\n\"Always.\"\\n\\n\"And why?\"\\n\\n\"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.\"\\n\\n\"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister\\'s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister\\'s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, \\'Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!\\' There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor\\'s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister\\'s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.\"\\n\\n\"One moment,\" said Holmes, \"are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?\"\\n\\n\"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.\"\\n\\n\"Was your sister dressed?\"\\n\\n\"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.\"\\n\\n\"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?\"\\n\\n\"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott\\'s conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.\"\\n\\n\"How about poison?\"\\n\\n\"The doctors examined her for it, but without success.\"\\n\\n\"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?\"\\n\\n\"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.\"\\n\\n\"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, there are nearly always some there.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckled band?\"\\n\\n\"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used.\"\\n\\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\\n\\n\"These are very deep waters,\" said he; \"pray go on with your narrative.\"\\n\\n\"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.\"\\n\\n\"You have done wisely,\" said my friend. \"But have you told me all?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, all.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.\"\\n\\n\"Why, what do you mean?\"\\n\\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor\\'s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\\n\\n\"You have been cruelly used,\" said Holmes.\\n\\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. \"He is a hard man,\" she said, \"and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.\"\\n\\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.\\n\\n\"This is a very deep business,\" he said at last. \"There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?\"\\n\\n\"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.\"\\n\\n\"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?\"\\n\\n\"By no means.\"\\n\\n\"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?\"\\n\\n\"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o\\'clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.\"\\n\\n\"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?\"\\n\\n\"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.\" She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.\\n\\n\"And what do you think of it all, Watson?\" asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.\\n\\n\"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.\"\\n\\n\"Dark enough and sinister enough.\"\\n\\n\"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end.\"\\n\\n\"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot think.\"\\n\\n\"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter\\'s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines.\"\\n\\n\"But what, then, did the gipsies do?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot imagine.\"\\n\\n\"I see many objections to any such theory.\"\\n\\n\"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!\"\\n\\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\\n\\n\"Which of you is Holmes?\" asked this apparition.\\n\\n\"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,\" said my companion quietly.\\n\\n\"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Doctor,\" said Holmes blandly. \"Pray take a seat.\"\\n\\n\"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?\"\\n\\n\"It is a little cold for the time of the year,\" said Holmes.\\n\\n\"What has she been saying to you?\" screamed the old man furiously.\\n\\n\"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,\" continued my companion imperturbably.\\n\\n\"Ha! You put me off, do you?\" said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. \"I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.\"\\n\\nMy friend smiled.\\n\\n\"Holmes, the busybody!\"\\n\\nHis smile broadened.\\n\\n\"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!\"\\n\\nHolmes chuckled heartily. \"Your conversation is most entertaining,\" said he. \"When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.\"\\n\\n\"I will go when I have said my say. Don\\'t you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.\" He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\\n\\n\"See that you keep yourself out of my grip,\" he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\\n\\n\"He seems a very amiable person,\" said Holmes, laughing. \"I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.\" As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\\n\\n\"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors\\' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.\"\\n\\nIt was nearly one o\\'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.\\n\\n\"I have seen the will of the deceased wife,\" said he. \"To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife\\'s death was little short of $1100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than $750. Each daughter can claim an income of $250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning\\'s work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley\\'s No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.\"\\n\\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.\\n\\n\"Look there!\" said he.\\n\\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\\n\\n\"Stoke Moran?\" said he.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,\" remarked the driver.\\n\\n\"There is some building going on there,\" said Holmes; \"that is where we are going.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s the village,\" said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; \"but if you want to get to the house, you\\'ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.\"\\n\\n\"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,\" observed Holmes, shading his eyes. \"Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.\"\\n\\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.\\n\\n\"I thought it as well,\" said Holmes as we climbed the stile, \"that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word.\"\\n\\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. \"I have been waiting so eagerly for you,\" she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. \"All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.\"\\n\\n\"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor\\'s acquaintance,\" said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" she cried, \"he has followed me, then.\"\\n\\n\"So it appears.\"\\n\\n\"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?\"\\n\\n\"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt\\'s at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine.\"\\n\\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.\\n\\n\"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister\\'s, and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott\\'s chamber?\"\\n\\n\"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.\"\\n\\n\"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.\"\\n\\n\"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.\"\\n\\n\"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?\"\\n\\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. \"Hum!\" said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, \"my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.\"\\n\\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\\n\\n\"Where does that bell communicate with?\" he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.\\n\\n\"It goes to the housekeeper\\'s room.\"\\n\\n\"It looks newer than the other things?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.\"\\n\\n\"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.\" He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\\n\\n\"Why, it\\'s a dummy,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Won\\'t it ring?\"\\n\\n\"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.\"\\n\\n\"How very absurd! I never noticed that before.\"\\n\\n\"Very strange!\" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. \"There are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!\"\\n\\n\"That is also quite modern,\" said the lady.\\n\\n\"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?\" remarked Holmes.\\n\\n\"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.\"\\n\\n\"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.\"\\n\\nDr. Grimesby Roylott\\'s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.\\n\\n\"What\\'s in here?\" he asked, tapping the safe.\\n\\n\"My stepfather\\'s business papers.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you have seen inside, then?\"\\n\\n\"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.\"\\n\\n\"There isn\\'t a cat in it, for example?\"\\n\\n\"No. What a strange idea!\"\\n\\n\"Well, look at this!\" He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.\\n\\n\"No; we don\\'t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.\" He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.\\n\\n\"Thank you. That is quite settled,\" said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. \"Hullo! Here is something interesting!\"\\n\\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.\\n\\n\"What do you make of that, Watson?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a common enough lash. But I don\\'t know why it should be tied.\"\\n\\n\"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it\\'s a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.\"\\n\\nI had never seen my friend\\'s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.\\n\\n\"It is very essential, Miss Stoner,\" said he, \"that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect.\"\\n\\n\"I shall most certainly do so.\"\\n\\n\"The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you that I am in your hands.\"\\n\\n\"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.\"\\n\\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\\n\\n\"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that is the Crown.\"\\n\\n\"Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\\n\"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, easily.\"\\n\\n\"The rest you will leave in our hands.\"\\n\\n\"But what will you do?\"\\n\\n\"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you.\"\\n\\n\"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,\" said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion\\'s sleeve.\\n\\n\"Perhaps I have.\"\\n\\n\"Then, for pity\\'s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister\\'s death.\"\\n\\n\"I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.\"\\n\\n\"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright.\"\\n\\n\"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor\\'s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\\n\\n\"Do you know, Watson,\" said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, \"I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger.\"\\n\\n\"Can I be of assistance?\"\\n\\n\"Your presence might be invaluable.\"\\n\\n\"Then I shall certainly come.\"\\n\\n\"It is very kind of you.\"\\n\\n\"You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.\"\\n\\n\"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did.\"\\n\\n\"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.\"\\n\\n\"You saw the ventilator, too?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through.\"\\n\\n\"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Holmes!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott\\'s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner\\'s inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.\"\\n\\n\"But what harm can there be in that?\"\\n\\n\"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot as yet see any connection.\"\\n\\n\"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot say that I have.\"\\n\\n\"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\"\\n\\n\"Holmes,\" I cried, \"I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.\"\\n\\n\"Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness\\' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.\"\\n\\nAbout nine o\\'clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.\\n\\n\"That is our signal,\" said Holmes, springing to his feet; \"it comes from the middle window.\"\\n\\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\\n\\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\\n\\n\"My God!\" I whispered; \"did you see it?\"\\n\\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.\\n\\n\"It is a nice household,\" he murmured. \"That is the baboon.\"\\n\\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes\\' example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:\\n\\n\"The least sound would be fatal to our plans.\"\\n\\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\\n\\n\"We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.\"\\n\\nI nodded again.\\n\\n\"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.\"\\n\\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\\n\\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\\n\\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\\n\\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\\n\\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\\n\\n\"You see it, Watson?\" he yelled. \"You see it?\"\\n\\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\\n\\n\"What can it mean?\" I gasped.\\n\\n\"It means that it is all over,\" Holmes answered. \"And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott\\'s room.\"\\n\\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\\n\\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\\n\\n\"The band! the speckled band!\" whispered Holmes.\\n\\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\\n\\n\"It is a swamp adder!\" cried Holmes; \"the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man\\'s lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile\\'s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm\\'s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.\\n\\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\\n\\n\"I had,\" said he, \"come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word \\'band,\\' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\\n\\n\"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.\"\\n\\n\"With the result of driving it through the ventilator.\"\\n\\n\"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott\\'s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.\"\\n\\nIX.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER\\'S THUMB\\n\\n\\nOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice--that of Mr. Hatherley\\'s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton\\'s madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.\\n\\nIt was in the summer of \\'89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.\\n\\nOne morning, at a little before seven o\\'clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got him here,\" he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; \"he\\'s all right.\"\\n\\n\"What is it, then?\" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a new patient,\" he whispered. \"I thought I\\'d bring him round myself; then he couldn\\'t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.\" And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.\\n\\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,\" said he, \"but I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.\"\\n\\nI took it up and glanced at it. \"Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).\" That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. \"I regret that I have kept you waiting,\" said I, sitting down in my library-chair. \"You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,\" said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.\\n\\n\"Stop it!\" I cried; \"pull yourself together!\" and I poured out some water from a caraffe.\\n\\nIt was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.\\n\\n\"I have been making a fool of myself,\" he gasped.\\n\\n\"Not at all. Drink this.\" I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\\n\\n\"That\\'s better!\" said he. \"And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.\"\\n\\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" I cried, \"this is a terrible injury. It must have bled considerably.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig.\"\\n\\n\"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.\"\\n\\n\"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.\"\\n\\n\"This has been done,\" said I, examining the wound, \"by a very heavy and sharp instrument.\"\\n\\n\"A thing like a cleaver,\" said he.\\n\\n\"An accident, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"By no means.\"\\n\\n\"What! a murderous attack?\"\\n\\n\"Very murderous indeed.\"\\n\\n\"You horrify me.\"\\n\\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.\\n\\n\"How is that?\" I asked when I had finished.\\n\\n\"Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to your nerves.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.\"\\n\\n\"Ha!\" cried I, \"if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I have heard of that fellow,\" answered my visitor, \"and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do better. I\\'ll take you round to him myself.\"\\n\\n\"I should be immensely obliged to you.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.\"\\n\\n\"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant.\" I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.\\n\\n\"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley,\" said he. \"Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said my patient. \"but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.\"\\n\\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.\\n\\n\"You must know,\" said he, \"that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father\\'s death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.\\n\\n\"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to $27 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.\\n\\n\"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of \\'Colonel Lysander Stark\\' engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.\\n\\n\" \\'Mr. Hatherley?\\' said he, with something of a German accent. \\'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.\\'\\n\\n\"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. \\'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'That is quite correct,\\' I answered; \\'but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'If I promise to keep a secret,\\' said I, \\'you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.\\'\\n\\n\"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\\n\\n\" \\'Do you promise, then?\\' said he at last.\\n\\n\" \\'Yes, I promise.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'I have already given you my word.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Very good.\\' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\\n\\n\" \\'That\\'s all right,\\' said he, coming back. \\'I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master\\'s affairs. Now we can talk in safety.\\' He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\\n\\n\"A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.\\n\\n\" \\'I beg that you will state your business, sir,\\' said I; \\'my time is of value.\\' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.\\n\\n\" \\'How would fifty guineas for a night\\'s work suit you?\\' he asked.\\n\\n\" \\'Most admirably.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'I say a night\\'s work, but an hour\\'s would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Where to?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Very good.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'There is a drive, then?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.\\'\\n\\n\"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. \\'Not at all,\\' said I, \\'I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Entirely.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller\\'s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'I have heard so.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller\\'s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'I quite follow you,\\' said I. \\'The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller\\'s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Ah!\\' said he carelessly, \\'we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.\\' He rose as he spoke. \\'I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'I shall certainly be there.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'And not a word to a soul.\\' He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.\\n\\n\"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller\\'s-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\\n\\n\"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o\\'clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go.\"\\n\\n\"One horse?\" interjected Holmes.\\n\\n\"Yes, only one.\"\\n\\n\"Did you observe the colour?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut.\"\\n\\n\"Tired-looking or fresh?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, fresh and glossy.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting statement.\"\\n\\n\"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.\\n\\n\"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\\n\\n\" \\'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,\\' said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. \\'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,\\' said he, and vanished into the darkness.\\n\\n\"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\\n\\n\"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\\n\\n\" \\'I would go,\\' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; \\'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'But, madam,\\' said I, \\'I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'It is not worth your while to wait,\\' she went on. \\'You can pass through the door; no one hinders.\\' And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. \\'For the love of Heaven!\\' she whispered, \\'get away from here before it is too late!\\'\\n\\n\"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.\\n\\n\"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\\n\\n\" \\'This is my secretary and manager,\\' said the colonel. \\'By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'On the contrary,\\' said I, \\'I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.\\'\\n\\n\"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. \\'Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,\\' said he. \\'Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Oh, no, it is in the house.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'What, you dig fuller\\'s-earth in the house?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.\\'\\n\\n\"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.\\n\\n\"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.\\n\\n\" \\'We are now,\\' said he, \\'actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.\\'\\n\\n\"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller\\'s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.\\n\\n\" \\'What are you doing there?\\' he asked.\\n\\n\"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. \\'I was admiring your fuller\\'s-earth,\\' said I; \\'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.\\'\\n\\n\"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\\n\\n\" \\'Very well,\\' said he, \\'you shall know all about the machine.\\' He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. \\'Hullo!\\' I yelled. \\'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!\\'\\n\\n\"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\\n\\n\"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.\\n\\n\"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\\n\\n\" \\'Come! come!\\' she cried breathlessly. \\'They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!\\'\\n\\n\"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit\\'s end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.\\n\\n\" \\'It is your only chance,\\' said she. \\'It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.\\'\\n\\n\"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher\\'s cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\\n\\n\" \\'Fritz! Fritz!\\' she cried in English, \\'remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!\\'\\n\\n\" \\'You are mad, Elise!\\' he shouted, struggling to break away from her. \\'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!\\' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.\\n\\n\"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.\\n\\n\"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night\\'s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\\n\\n\"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.\\n\\n\"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.\"\\n\\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\\n\\n\"Here is an advertisement which will interest you,\" said he. \"It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: \\'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o\\'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,\\' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried my patient. \"Then that explains what the girl said.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.\"\\n\\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.\\n\\n\"There you are,\" said he. \"That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.\"\\n\\n\"It was an hour\\'s good drive.\"\\n\\n\"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?\"\\n\\n\"They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere.\"\\n\\n\"What I cannot understand,\" said I, \"is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman\\'s entreaties.\"\\n\\n\"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,\" said Bradstreet. \"Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.\"\\n\\n\"I think I could lay my finger on it,\" said Holmes quietly.\\n\\n\"Really, now!\" cried the inspector, \"you have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there.\"\\n\\n\"And I say east,\" said my patient.\\n\\n\"I am for west,\" remarked the plain-clothes man. \"There are several quiet little villages up there.\"\\n\\n\"And I am for north,\" said I, \"because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.\"\\n\\n\"Come,\" cried the inspector, laughing; \"it\\'s a very pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?\"\\n\\n\"You are all wrong.\"\\n\\n\"But we can\\'t all be.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.\" He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. \"This is where we shall find them.\"\\n\\n\"But the twelve-mile drive?\" gasped Hatherley.\\n\\n\"Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,\" observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. \"Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.\"\\n\\n\"None at all,\" said Holmes. \"They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.\"\\n\\n\"We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,\" said the inspector. \"They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.\"\\n\\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.\\n\\n\"A house on fire?\" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir!\" said the station-master.\\n\\n\"When did it break out?\"\\n\\n\"I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze.\"\\n\\n\"Whose house is it?\"\\n\\n\"Dr. Becher\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me,\" broke in the engineer, \"is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?\"\\n\\nThe station-master laughed heartily. \"No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn\\'t a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm.\"\\n\\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\\n\\n\"That\\'s it!\" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. \"There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from.\"\\n\\n\"Well, at least,\" said Holmes, \"you have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.\"\\n\\nAnd Holmes\\' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes\\' ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.\\n\\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.\\n\\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, \"it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?\"\\n\\n\"Experience,\" said Holmes, laughing. \"Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.\"\\n\\nX.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR\\n\\n\\nThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.\\n\\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend\\'s noble correspondent could be.\\n\\n\"Here is a very fashionable epistle,\" I remarked as he entered. \"Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,\" he answered, smiling, \"and the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.\"\\n\\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\\n\\n\"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.\"\\n\\n\"Not social, then?\"\\n\\n\"No, distinctly professional.\"\\n\\n\"And from a noble client?\"\\n\\n\"One of the highest in England.\"\\n\\n\"My dear fellow, I congratulate you.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?\"\\n\\n\"It looks like it,\" said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. \"I have had nothing else to do.\"\\n\\n\"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.\"\\n\\n\"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:\\n\\n\" \\'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o\\'clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours faithfully,\\n\\n\\n\" \\'ST. SIMON.\\'\\n\\n\"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger,\" remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.\\n\\n\"He says four o\\'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.\"\\n\\n\"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.\" He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. \"Here he is,\" said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. \" \\'Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.\\' Hum! \\'Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.\\' He\\'s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid.\"\\n\\n\"I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,\" said I, \"for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.\"\\n\\n\"Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: \\'A marriage has been arranged,\\' it says, \\'and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.\\' That is all.\"\\n\\n\"Terse and to the point,\" remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.\\n\\n\"There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: \\'There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god\\'s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.\\' \"\\n\\n\"Anything else?\" asked Holmes, yawning.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George\\'s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater\\'s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.\"\\n\\n\"Before the what?\" asked Holmes with a start.\\n\\n\"The vanishing of the lady.\"\\n\\n\"When did she vanish, then?\"\\n\\n\"At the wedding breakfast.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.\"\\n\\n\"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details.\"\\n\\n\"I warn you that they are very incomplete.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps we may make them less so.\"\\n\\n\"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, \\'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding\\':\\n\\n\" \\'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\\n\\n\" \\'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George\\'s, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.\\' \"\\n\\n\"And is that all?\"\\n\\n\"Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.\"\\n\\n\"And it is--\"\\n\\n\"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the public press.\"\\n\\n\"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.\"\\n\\n\"Lord Robert St. Simon,\" announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.\\n\\n\"Good-day, Lord St. Simon,\" said Holmes, rising and bowing. \"Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.\"\\n\\n\"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.\"\\n\\n\"No, I am descending.\"\\n\\n\"I beg pardon.\"\\n\\n\"My last client of the sort was a king.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?\"\\n\\n\"The King of Scandinavia.\"\\n\\n\"What! Had he lost his wife?\"\\n\\n\"You can understand,\" said Holmes suavely, \"that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.\"\\n\\n\"Of course! Very right! very right! I\\'m sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.\"\\n\\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. \"Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.\"\\n\\n\"But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.\"\\n\\n\"Pray do so.\"\\n\\n\"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?\"\\n\\n\"In San Francisco, a year ago.\"\\n\\n\"You were travelling in the States?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Did you become engaged then?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"But you were on a friendly footing?\"\\n\\n\"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.\"\\n\\n\"Her father is very rich?\"\\n\\n\"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.\"\\n\\n\"And how did he make his money?\"\\n\\n\"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.\"\\n\\n\"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady\\'s--your wife\\'s character?\"\\n\\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. \"You see, Mr. Holmes,\" said he, \"my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear\"--he gave a little stately cough--\"had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.\"\\n\\n\"Have you her photograph?\"\\n\\n\"I brought this with me.\" He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\\n\\n\"The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.\"\\n\\n\"She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?\"\\n\\n\"A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.\"\\n\\n\"And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?\"\\n\\n\"I really have made no inquiries on the subject.\"\\n\\n\"Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Was she in good spirits?\"\\n\\n\"Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?\"\\n\\n\"She was as bright as possible--at least until after the ceremony.\"\\n\\n\"And did you observe any change in her then?\"\\n\\n\"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.\"\\n\\n\"Pray let us have it, for all that.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment\\'s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.\"\\n\\n\"This gentleman was not one of your wife\\'s friends?\"\\n\\n\"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.\"\\n\\n\"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father\\'s house?\"\\n\\n\"I saw her in conversation with her maid.\"\\n\\n\"And who is her maid?\"\\n\\n\"Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with her.\"\\n\\n\"A confidential servant?\"\\n\\n\"A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way.\"\\n\\n\"How long did she speak to this Alice?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.\"\\n\\n\"You did not overhear what they said?\"\\n\\n\"Lady St. Simon said something about \\'jumping a claim.\\' She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.\"\\n\\n\"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?\"\\n\\n\"She walked into the breakfast-room.\"\\n\\n\"On your arm?\"\\n\\n\"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.\"\\n\\n\"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride\\'s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran\\'s house that morning.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.\"\\n\\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. \"We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran\\'s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.\"\\n\\n\"Did your wife hear all this?\"\\n\\n\"No, thank goodness, she did not.\"\\n\\n\"And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it is a possible supposition.\"\\n\\n\"You think so, too?\"\\n\\n\"I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?\"\\n\\n\"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.\"\\n\\n\"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?\"\\n\\n\"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.\"\\n\\n\"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?\"\\n\\n\"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\"\\n\\n\"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,\" said Holmes, smiling. \"And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?\"\\n\\n\"We could see the other side of the road and the Park.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you.\"\\n\\n\"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,\" said our client, rising.\\n\\n\"I have solved it.\"\\n\\n\"Eh? What was that?\"\\n\\n\"I say that I have solved it.\"\\n\\n\"Where, then, is my wife?\"\\n\\n\"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.\"\\n\\nLord St. Simon shook his head. \"I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine,\" he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.\\n\\n\"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own,\" said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \"I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Holmes!\"\\n\\n\"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau\\'s example.\"\\n\\n\"But I have heard all that you have heard.\"\\n\\n\"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.\"\\n\\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.\\n\\n\"What\\'s up, then?\" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. \"You look dissatisfied.\"\\n\\n\"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.\"\\n\\n\"Really! You surprise me.\"\\n\\n\"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.\"\\n\\n\"And very wet it seems to have made you,\" said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.\\n\\n\"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.\"\\n\\n\"In heaven\\'s name, what for?\"\\n\\n\"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\\n\\n\"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Why? What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.\"\\n\\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. \"I suppose you know all about it,\" he snarled.\\n\\n\"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?\"\\n\\n\"I think it very unlikely.\"\\n\\n\"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?\" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride\\'s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. \"There,\" said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. \"There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. \"You dragged them from the Serpentine?\"\\n\\n\"No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.\"\\n\\n\"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man\\'s body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?\"\\n\\n\"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid that you will find it difficult.\"\\n\\n\"Are you, indeed, now?\" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. \"I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.\"\\n\\n\"And how?\"\\n\\n\"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note.\" He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. \"Listen to this: \\'You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.\\' Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach.\"\\n\\n\"Very good, Lestrade,\" said Holmes, laughing. \"You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it.\" He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. \"This is indeed important,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Ha! you find it so?\"\\n\\n\"Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.\"\\n\\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. \"Why,\" he shrieked, \"you\\'re looking at the wrong side!\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary, this is the right side.\"\\n\\n\"The right side? You\\'re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here.\"\\n\\n\"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing in it. I looked at it before,\" said Lestrade. \" \\'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.\\' I see nothing in that.\"\\n\\n\"Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve wasted time enough,\" said Lestrade, rising. \"I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.\" He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.\\n\\n\"Just one hint to you, Lestrade,\" drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; \"I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person.\"\\n\\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\\n\\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. \"There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,\" he remarked, \"so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little.\"\\n\\nIt was after five o\\'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner\\'s man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pate de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.\\n\\nJust before nine o\\'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\\n\\n\"They have laid the supper, then,\" he said, rubbing his hands.\\n\\n\"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,\" said he. \"I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.\"\\n\\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\\n\\n\"My messenger reached you, then?\" asked Holmes.\\n\\n\"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?\"\\n\\n\"The best possible.\"\\n\\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\\n\\n\"What will the Duke say,\" he murmured, \"when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?\"\\n\\n\"It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.\"\\n\\n\"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.\"\\n\\n\"It was a slight, sir, a public slight,\" said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.\\n\\n\"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.\"\\n\\n\"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.\"\\n\\n\"I think that I heard a ring,\" said Holmes. \"Yes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.\" He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. \"Lord St. Simon,\" said he \"allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.\"\\n\\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\\n\\n\"You\\'re angry, Robert,\" said she. \"Well, I guess you have every cause to be.\"\\n\\n\"Pray make no apology to me,\" said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn\\'t know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn\\'t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?\"\\n\\n\"If I may give an opinion,\" remarked the strange gentleman, \"we\\'ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.\" He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll tell our story right away,\" said the lady. \"Frank here and I met in \\'84, in McQuire\\'s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn\\'t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to \\'Frisco. Frank wouldn\\'t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. \\'Why shouldn\\'t we be married right away, then,\\' said he, \\'and then I will feel sure of you; and I won\\'t claim to be your husband until I come back?\\' Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.\\n\\n\"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners\\' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank\\'s name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in \\'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to \\'Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\\n\\n\"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I\\'d have done my duty by him. We can\\'t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn\\'t drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn\\'t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\\n\\n\"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn\\'t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to \\'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.\"\\n\\n\"I saw it in a paper,\" explained the American. \"It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived.\"\\n\\n\"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.\"\\n\\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\\n\\n\"Excuse me,\" he said, \"but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner.\"\\n\\n\"Then you won\\'t forgive me? You won\\'t shake hands before I go?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.\" He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\\n\\n\"I had hoped,\" suggested Holmes, \"that you would have joined us in a friendly supper.\"\\n\\n\"I think that there you ask a little too much,\" responded his Lordship. \"I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.\" He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\\n\\n\"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.\"\\n\\n\"The case has been an interesting one,\" remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, \"because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.\"\\n\\n\"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?\"\\n\\n\"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon\\'s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride\\'s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners\\' parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter.\"\\n\\n\"And how in the world did you find them?\"\\n\\n\"It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels.\"\\n\\n\"How did you deduce the select?\"\\n\\n\"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment.\"\\n\\n\"But with no very good result,\" I remarked. \"His conduct was certainly not very gracious.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, Watson,\" said Holmes, smiling, \"perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.\"\\n\\nXI.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET\\n\\n\\n\"Holmes,\" said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, \"here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.\"\\n\\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\\n\\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.\\n\\n\"What on earth can be the matter with him?\" I asked. \"He is looking up at the numbers of the houses.\"\\n\\n\"I believe that he is coming here,\" said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\\n\\n\"Here?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?\" As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.\\n\\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\\n\\n\"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?\" said he. \"You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.\"\\n\\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.\\n\\n\"No doubt you think me mad?\" said he.\\n\\n\"I see that you have had some great trouble,\" responded Holmes.\\n\\n\"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.\"\\n\\n\"Pray compose yourself, sir,\" said Holmes, \"and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.\"\\n\\n\"My name,\" answered our visitor, \"is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.\"\\n\\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\\n\\n\"I feel that time is of value,\" said he; \"that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\\n\\n\"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\\n\\n\"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\\n\\n\" \\'Mr. Holder,\\' said he, \\'I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'The firm does so when the security is good.\\' I answered.\\n\\n\" \\'It is absolutely essential to me,\\' said he, \\'that I should have $50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one\\'s self under obligations.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?\\' I asked.\\n\\n\" \\'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,\\' said I, \\'were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'I should much prefer to have it so,\\' said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. \\'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,\\' said I.\\n\\n\" \\'Precisely.\\' He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. \\'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,\\' said he, \\'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.\\'\\n\\n\"I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.\\n\\n\" \\'You doubt its value?\\' he asked.\\n\\n\" \\'Not at all. I only doubt--\\'\\n\\n\" \\'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Ample.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.\\'\\n\\n\"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty $1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.\\n\\n\"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers\\' safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.\\n\\n\"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\\n\\n\"So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\\n\\n\"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\\n\\n\"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman\\'s quick insight into character.\\n\\n\"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!\\n\\n\"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.\\n\\n\"When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\\n\\n\" \\'Where have you put it?\\' asked Arthur.\\n\\n\" \\'In my own bureau.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Well, I hope to goodness the house won\\'t be burgled during the night.\\' said he.\\n\\n\" \\'It is locked up,\\' I answered.\\n\\n\" \\'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.\\'\\n\\n\"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\\n\\n\" \\'Look here, dad,\\' said he with his eyes cast down, \\'can you let me have $200?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'No, I cannot!\\' I answered sharply. \\'I have been far too generous with you in money matters.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'You have been very kind,\\' said he, \\'but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'And a very good thing, too!\\' I cried.\\n\\n\" \\'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,\\' said he. \\'I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.\\'\\n\\n\"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. \\'You shall not have a farthing from me,\\' I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.\\n\\n\"When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\\n\\n\" \\'Tell me, dad,\\' said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, \\'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Certainly not.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Quite sure, dad.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Then, good-night.\\' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.\\n\\n\"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.\"\\n\\n\"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.\\n\\n\" \\'Arthur!\\' I screamed, \\'you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?\\'\\n\\n\"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\\n\\n\" \\'You blackguard!\\' I shouted, beside myself with rage. \\'You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Stolen!\\' he cried.\\n\\n\" \\'Yes, thief!\\' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\\n\\n\" \\'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,\\' said he.\\n\\n\" \\'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'You have called me names enough,\\' said he, \\'I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!\\' I cried half-mad with grief and rage. \\'I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'You shall learn nothing from me,\\' said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. \\'If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.\\'\\n\\n\"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur\\'s face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.\\n\\n\" \\'At least,\\' said he, \\'you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,\\' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.\\n\\n\" \\'You may as well face the matter,\\' said I; \\'you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,\\' he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of $1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!\"\\n\\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.\\n\\n\"Do you receive much company?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur\\'s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Do you go out much in society?\"\\n\\n\"Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.\"\\n\\n\"That is unusual in a young girl.\"\\n\\n\"She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-and-twenty.\"\\n\\n\"This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.\"\\n\\n\"Terrible! She is even more affected than I.\"\\n\\n\"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son\\'s guilt?\"\\n\\n\"How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands.\"\\n\\n\"I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it was twisted.\"\\n\\n\"Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?\"\\n\\n\"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?\"\\n\\n\"Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?\"\\n\\n\"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur\\'s closing his bedroom door.\"\\n\\n\"A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?\"\\n\\n\"They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.\"\\n\\n\"Have they thought of looking outside the house?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined.\"\\n\\n\"Now, my dear sir,\" said Holmes. \"is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?\"\\n\\n\"But what other is there?\" cried the banker with a gesture of despair. \"If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?\"\\n\\n\"It is our task to find that out,\" replied Holmes; \"so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.\"\\n\\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker\\'s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes\\' judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.\\n\\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen\\'s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen\\'s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman\\'s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\\n\\n\"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.\"\\n\\n\"But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman\\'s instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.\"\\n\\n\"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\"\\n\\n\"Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.\"\\n\\n\"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!\"\\n\\n\"I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it.\"\\n\\n\"This gentleman?\" she asked, facing round to me.\\n\\n\"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now.\"\\n\\n\"The stable lane?\" She raised her dark eyebrows. \"What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.\"\\n\\n\"I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,\" returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. \"I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?\"\\n\\n\"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.\"\\n\\n\"You heard nothing yourself last night?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down.\"\\n\\n\"You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Were they all fastened this morning?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle\\'s remarks about the coronet.\"\\n\\n\"I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.\"\\n\\n\"But what is the good of all these vague theories,\" cried the banker impatiently, \"when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?\"\\n\\n\"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know him?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper.\"\\n\\n\"He stood,\" said Holmes, \"to the left of the door--that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he did.\"\\n\\n\"And he is a man with a wooden leg?\"\\n\\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady\\'s expressive black eyes. \"Why, you are like a magician,\" said she. \"How do you know that?\" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes\\' thin, eager face.\\n\\n\"I should be very glad now to go upstairs,\" said he. \"I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.\"\\n\\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. \"Now we shall go upstairs,\" said he at last.\\n\\nThe banker\\'s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.\\n\\n\"Which key was used to open it?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.\"\\n\\n\"Have you it here?\"\\n\\n\"That is it on the dressing-table.\"\\n\\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\\n\\n\"It is a noiseless lock,\" said he. \"It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it.\" He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller\\'s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\\n\\n\"Now, Mr. Holder,\" said Holmes, \"here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off.\"\\n\\nThe banker recoiled in horror. \"I should not dream of trying,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Then I will.\" Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. \"I feel it give a little,\" said he; \"but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.\"\\n\\n\"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?\"\\n\\n\"I confess that I still share my uncle\\'s perplexity.\"\\n\\n\"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?\"\\n\\n\"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.\"\\n\\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.\\n\\n\"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,\" said he; \"I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.\"\\n\\n\"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot tell.\"\\n\\nThe banker wrung his hands. \"I shall never see them again!\" he cried. \"And my son? You give me hopes?\"\\n\\n\"My opinion is in no way altered.\"\\n\\n\"Then, for God\\'s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?\"\\n\\n\"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.\"\\n\\n\"I would give my fortune to have them back.\"\\n\\n\"Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.\"\\n\\nIt was obvious to me that my companion\\'s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\\n\\n\"I think that this should do,\" said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. \"I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won\\'t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o\\'-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.\" He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.\\n\\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\\n\\n\"I only looked in as I passed,\" said he. \"I am going right on.\"\\n\\n\"Where to?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don\\'t wait up for me in case I should be late.\"\\n\\n\"How are you getting on?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.\"\\n\\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\\n\\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.\\n\\n\"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,\" said he, \"but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.\"\\n\\n\"Why, it is after nine now,\" I answered. \"I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.\"\\n\\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.\\n\\n\"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,\" said he. \"Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.\"\\n\\n\"Deserted you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\\n\\n\" \\'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving\\n\\n\\n\" \\'MARY.\\'\\n\\n\"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?\"\\n\\n\"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.\"\\n\\n\"Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?\"\\n\\n\"You would not think $1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?\"\\n\\n\"I would pay ten.\"\\n\\n\"That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for $4000.\"\\n\\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\\n\\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\\n\\n\"You have it!\" he gasped. \"I am saved! I am saved!\"\\n\\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\\n\\n\"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,\" said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.\\n\\n\"Owe!\" He caught up a pen. \"Name the sum, and I will pay it.\"\\n\\n\"No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.\"\\n\\n\"Then it was not Arthur who took them?\"\\n\\n\"I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.\"\\n\\n\"You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known.\"\\n\\n\"He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.\"\\n\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!\"\\n\\n\"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.\"\\n\\n\"My Mary? Impossible!\"\\n\\n\"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!\" cried the banker with an ashen face.\\n\\n\"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants\\' escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.\\n\\n\"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\\n\\n\"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.\"\\n\\n\"Is it possible?\" gasped the banker.\\n\\n\"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.\"\\n\\n\"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,\" cried Mr. Holder. \"Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!\"\\n\\n\"When I arrived at the house,\" continued Holmes, \"I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen\\'s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.\\n\\n\"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\\n\\n\"On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?\\n\\n\"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\\n\\n\"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.\\n\\n\"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George\\'s house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.\"\\n\\n\"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,\" said Mr. Holder.\\n\\n\"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held--$1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. \\'Why, dash it all!\\' said he, \\'I\\'ve let them go at six hundred for the three!\\' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at $1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o\\'clock, after what I may call a really hard day\\'s work.\"\\n\\n\"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,\" said the banker, rising. \"Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.\"\\n\\n\"I think that we may safely say,\" returned Holmes, \"that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.\"\\n\\nXII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES\\n\\n\\n\"To the man who loves art for its own sake,\" remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, \"it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes celebres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.\"\\n\\n\"And yet,\" said I, smiling, \"I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.\"\\n\\n\"You have erred, perhaps,\" he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood--\"you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.\"\\n\\n\"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,\" I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend\\'s singular character.\\n\\n\"No, it is not selfishness or conceit,\" said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. \"If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.\"\\n\\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\\n\\n\"At the same time,\" he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, \"you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.\"\\n\\n\"The end may have been so,\" I answered, \"but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest.\"\\n\\n\"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!\" He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.\\n\\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:\\n\\n\"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,\\n\\n\\n\"VIOLET HUNTER.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know the young lady?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Not I.\"\\n\\n\"It is half-past ten now.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.\"\\n\\n\"It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also.\"\\n\\n\"Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover\\'s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.\\n\\n\"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,\" said she, as my companion rose to greet her, \"but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.\"\\n\\n\"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.\"\\n\\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.\\n\\n\"I have been a governess for five years,\" said she, \"in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit\\'s end as to what I should do.\\n\\n\"There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway\\'s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.\\n\\n\"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\\n\\n\" \\'That will do,\\' said he; \\'I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!\\' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\\n\\n\" \\'You are looking for a situation, miss?\\' he asked.\\n\\n\" \\'Yes, sir.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'As governess?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Yes, sir.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'And what salary do you ask?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'I had $4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!\\' he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. \\'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,\\' said I. \\'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Tut, tut!\\' he cried. \\'This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at $100 a year.\\'\\n\\n\"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.\\n\\n\" \\'It is also my custom,\\' said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, \\'to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.\\'\\n\\n\"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.\\n\\n\" \\'May I ask where you live, sir?\\' said I.\\n\\n\" \\'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!\\' He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.\\n\\n\"I was a little startled at the nature of the child\\'s amusement, but the father\\'s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\\n\\n\" \\'My sole duties, then,\\' I asked, \\'are to take charge of a single child?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,\\' he cried. \\'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'I should be happy to make myself useful.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'No,\\' said I, considerably astonished at his words.\\n\\n\" \\'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Oh, no.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?\\'\\n\\n\"I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.\\n\\n\" \\'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,\\' said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.\\n\\n\" \\'I am afraid that it is quite essential,\\' said he. \\'It is a little fancy of my wife\\'s, and ladies\\' fancies, you know, madam, ladies\\' fancies must be consulted. And so you won\\'t cut your hair?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'No, sir, I really could not,\\' I answered firmly.\\n\\n\" \\'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.\\'\\n\\n\"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.\\n\\n\" \\'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?\\' she asked.\\n\\n\" \\'If you please, Miss Stoper.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,\\' said she sharply. \\'You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.\\' She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.\\n\\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table. I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting $100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:\\n\\n\\n\" \\'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\\n\\n\" \\'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give $30 a quarter, or $120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,\\n\\n\\n\" \\'JEPHRO RUCASTLE.\\'\\n\\n\"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question,\" said Holmes, smiling.\\n\\n\"But you would not advise me to refuse?\"\\n\\n\"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for.\"\\n\\n\"What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?\"\\n\\n\"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?\"\\n\\n\"That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.\"\\n\\n\"But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!\"\\n\\n\"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you $120 a year, when they could have their pick for $40? There must be some strong reason behind.\"\\n\\n\"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger--\"\\n\\n\"Danger! What danger do you foresee?\"\\n\\nHolmes shook his head gravely. \"It would cease to be a danger if we could define it,\" said he. \"But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.\"\\n\\n\"That is enough.\" She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. \"I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.\" With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\\n\\n\"At least,\" said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, \"she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.\"\\n\\n\"And she would need to be,\" said Holmes gravely. \"I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.\"\\n\\nIt was not very long before my friend\\'s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. \"Data! data! data!\" he cried impatiently. \"I can\\'t make bricks without clay.\" And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.\\n\\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\\n\\n\"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,\" said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.\\n\\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\\n\\n\"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,\" it said. \"Do come! I am at my wit\\'s end.\\n\\n\\n\"HUNTER.\"\\n\\n\"Will you come with me?\" asked Holmes, glancing up.\\n\\n\"I should wish to.\"\\n\\n\"Just look it up, then.\"\\n\\n\"There is a train at half-past nine,\" said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. \"It is due at Winchester at 11:30.\"\\n\\n\"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.\"\\n\\nBy eleven o\\'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man\\'s energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.\\n\\n\"Are they not fresh and beautiful?\" I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\\n\\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\\n\\n\"Do you know, Watson,\" said he, \"that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" I cried. \"Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?\"\\n\\n\"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.\"\\n\\n\"You horrify me!\"\\n\\n\"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard\\'s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.\"\\n\\n\"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so. She has her freedom.\"\\n\\n\"What can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?\"\\n\\n\"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.\"\\n\\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\\n\\n\"I am so delighted that you have come,\" she said earnestly. \"It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.\"\\n\\n\"Pray tell us what has happened to you.\"\\n\\n\"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.\"\\n\\n\"Let us have everything in its due order.\" Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\\n\\n\"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.\"\\n\\n\"What can you not understand?\"\\n\\n\"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton\\'s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\\n\\n\"I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father\\'s young wife.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad of all details,\" remarked my friend, \"whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.\"\\n\\n\"I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.\\n\\n\"For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.\\n\\n\" \\'Oh, yes,\\' said he, turning to me, \\'we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.\\'\\n\\n\"The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\\n\\n\"Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense repertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\\n\\n\"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.\\n\\n\" \\'Jephro,\\' said she, \\'there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?\\' he asked.\\n\\n\" \\'No, I know no one in these parts.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Surely it would be better to take no notice.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.\\'\\n\\n\"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.\"\\n\\n\"Pray continue,\" said Holmes. \"Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one.\"\\n\\n\"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.\\n\\n\" \\'Look in here!\\' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. \\'Is he not a beauty?\\'\\n\\n\"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.\\n\\n\" \\'Don\\'t be frightened,\\' said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. \\'It\\'s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness\\' sake don\\'t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it\\'s as much as your life is worth.\\'\\n\\n\"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o\\'clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\\n\\n\"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.\\n\\n\"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.\\n\\n\"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.\\n\\n\"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\\n\\n\" \\'Ah!\\' said he, \\'you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.\\'\\n\\n\"I assured him that I was not offended. \\'By the way,\\' said I, \\'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.\\'\\n\\n\"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.\\n\\n\" \\'Photography is one of my hobbies,\\' said he. \\'I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?\\' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\\n\\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman\\'s instinct; perhaps it was woman\\'s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\\n\\n\"It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\\n\\n\"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\\n\\n\" \\'So,\\' said he, smiling, \\'it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Oh, I am so frightened!\\' I panted.\\n\\n\" \\'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!\\'--you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was--\\'and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?\\'\\n\\n\"But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.\\n\\n\" \\'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,\\' I answered. \\'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Only that?\\' said he, looking at me keenly.\\n\\n\" \\'Why, what did you think?\\' I asked.\\n\\n\" \\'Why do you think that I lock this door?\\'\\n\\n\" \\'I am sure that I do not know.\\'\\n\\n\" \\'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?\\' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\\n\\n\" \\'I am sure if I had known--\\'\\n\\n\" \\'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again\\'--here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon--\\'I\\'ll throw you to the mastiff.\\'\\n\\n\"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o\\'clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.\"\\n\\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\\n\\n\"Is Toller still drunk?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him.\"\\n\\n\"That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, the wine-cellar.\"\\n\\n\"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman.\"\\n\\n\"I will try. What is it?\"\\n\\n\"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o\\'clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.\"\\n\\n\"I will do it.\"\\n\\n\"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiance--and no doubt, as you wore the girl\\'s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.\"\\n\\n\"What on earth has that to do with it?\" I ejaculated.\\n\\n\"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don\\'t you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child\\'s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty\\'s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\" cried our client. \"A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.\"\\n\\n\"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o\\'clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.\"\\n\\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\\n\\n\"Have you managed it?\" asked Holmes.\\n\\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. \"That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar,\" said she. \"Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"You have done well indeed!\" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. \"Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.\"\\n\\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes\\' face clouded over.\\n\\n\"I trust that we are not too late,\" said he. \"I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.\"\\n\\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\\n\\n\"There has been some villainy here,\" said Holmes; \"this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter\\'s intentions and has carried his victim off.\"\\n\\n\"But how?\"\\n\\n\"Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.\" He swung himself up onto the roof. \"Ah, yes,\" he cried, \"here\\'s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.\"\\n\\n\"But it is impossible,\" said Miss Hunter; \"the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away.\"\\n\\n\"He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready.\"\\n\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\\n\\n\"You villain!\" said he, \"where\\'s your daughter?\"\\n\\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\\n\\n\"It is for me to ask you that,\" he shrieked, \"you thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I\\'ll serve you!\" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\\n\\n\"He\\'s gone for the dog!\" cried Miss Hunter.\\n\\n\"I have my revolver,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Better close the front door,\" cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\\n\\n\"My God!\" he cried. \"Someone has loosed the dog. It\\'s not been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it\\'ll be too late!\"\\n\\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle\\'s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Toller!\" cried Miss Hunter.\\n\\n\"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn\\'t let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.\"\\n\\n\"Ha!\" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. \"It is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.\"\\n\\n\"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.\"\\n\\n\"I will soon make it clear to you,\" said she; \"and I\\'d have done so before now if I could ha\\' got out from the cellar. If there\\'s police-court business over this, you\\'ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice\\'s friend too.\\n\\n\"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn\\'t, from the time that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend\\'s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle\\'s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn\\'t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death\\'s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn\\'t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.\"\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said Holmes, \"I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.\"\\n\\n\"That was it, sir.\"\\n\\n\"But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,\" said Mrs. Toller serenely.\\n\\n\"And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.\"\\n\\n\"You have it, sir, just as it happened.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,\" said Holmes, \"for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one.\"\\n\\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle\\'s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ***\\n\\nThis file should be named advsh12h.htm or advsh12h.zip\\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, advsh13h.txt\\nVERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, advsh12ah.txt\\n\\nProject Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US\\nunless a copyright notice is included.

Cushing Co.--Berwick & Smith Co.\\n\\nNORWOOD, MASS., U.S.A.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE\\n\\n\\nAs things now stand, the course of instruction in American history in\\nour public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject.\\nThree separate books are used. First, there is the primary book, which\\nis usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and\\nanecdotes. Second, there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth\\ngrade, generally speaking, an expansion of the elementary book by the\\naddition of forty or fifty thousand words. Finally, there is the high\\nschool manual. This, too, ordinarily follows the beaten path, giving\\nfuller accounts of the same events and characters. To put it bluntly, we\\ndo not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their\\nstudy of history in the lower grades. If mathematicians followed the\\nsame method, high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the\\nmultiplication table and fractions.\\n\\nThere is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism advanced above. It\\nis that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history\\ntheir pupils retain as they pass along the regular route. No teacher of\\nhistory will deny this. Still it is a standing challenge to existing\\nmethods of historical instruction. If the study of history cannot be\\nmade truly progressive like the study of mathematics, science, and\\nlanguages, then the historians assume a grave responsibility in adding\\ntheir subject to the already overloaded curriculum. If the successive\\nhistorical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text--more\\nfacts, more dates, more words--then history deserves most of the sharp\\ncriticism which it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and\\neconomics.\\n\\nIn this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a\\nnew high school text in American history. Our first contribution is one\\nof omission. The time-honored stories of exploration and the\\nbiographies of heroes are left out. We frankly hold that, if pupils know\\nlittle or nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John\\nSmith by the time they reach the high school, it is useless to tell the\\nsame stories for perhaps the fourth time. It is worse than useless. It\\nis an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are\\ndemonstrated to be progressive in character.\\n\\nIn the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles. Our\\nreasons for this are simple. The strategy of a campaign or of a single\\nbattle is a highly technical, and usually a highly controversial, matter\\nabout which experts differ widely. In the field of military and naval\\noperations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices. To\\ndispose of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is\\nequally absurd to the serious student of military affairs. Any one who\\ncompares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign\\nwith the account given by Ropes, for instance, will ask for no further\\ncomment. No youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think\\nof turning to a high school manual for information about the art of\\nwarfare. The dramatic scene or episode, so useful in arousing the\\ninterest of the immature pupil, seems out of place in a book that\\ndeliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life\\'s\\nserious responsibilities.\\n\\nIt is not upon negative features, however, that we rest our case. It is\\nrather upon constructive features.\\n\\n_First._ We have written a topical, not a narrative, history. We have\\ntried to set forth the important aspects, problems, and movements of\\neach period, bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration.\\n\\n_Second._ We have emphasized those historical topics which help to\\nexplain how our nation has come to be what it is to-day.\\n\\n_Third._ We have dwelt fully upon the social and economic aspects of our\\nhistory, especially in relation to the politics of each period.\\n\\n_Fourth._ We have treated the causes and results of wars, the problems\\nof financing and sustaining armed forces, rather than military strategy.\\nThese are the subjects which belong to a history for civilians. These\\nare matters which civilians can understand--matters which they must\\nunderstand, if they are to play well their part in war and peace.\\n\\n_Fifth._ By omitting the period of exploration, we have been able to\\nenlarge the treatment of our own time. We have given special attention\\nto the history of those current questions which must form the subject\\nmatter of sound instruction in citizenship.\\n\\n_Sixth._ We have borne in mind that America, with all her unique\\ncharacteristics, is a part of a general civilization. Accordingly we\\nhave given diplomacy, foreign affairs, world relations, and the\\nreciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place.\\n\\n_Seventh._ We have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity. The\\nstudy of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory. We\\nhave aimed to stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, association,\\nreflection, and generalization--habits calculated to enlarge as well as\\ninform the mind. We have been at great pains to make our text clear,\\nsimple, and direct; but we have earnestly sought to stretch the\\nintellects of our readers--to put them upon their mettle. Most of them\\nwill receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school.\\nThe world will soon expect maturity from them. Their achievements will\\ndepend upon the possession of other powers than memory alone. The\\neffectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by\\nthe excellence of their judgment as well as the fullness of their\\ninformation.\\n\\n     C.A.B.\\n     M.R.B.\\n\\n     NEW YORK CITY,\\n     February 8, 1921.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=A SMALL LIBRARY IN AMERICAN HISTORY=\\n\\n\\n_=SINGLE VOLUMES:=_\\n\\nBASSETT, J.S. _A Short History of the United States_\\nELSON, H.W. _History of the United States of America_\\n\\n\\n_=SERIES:=_\\n\\n\"EPOCHS OF AMERICAN HISTORY,\" EDITED BY A.B.

The group as a whole is beautifully\\n     symbolic of the westward march of American civilization.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Photograph by Cardinell-Vincent Co., San Francisco_\\n\\n\"THE NATIONS OF THE WEST\"]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART I. THE COLONIAL PERIOD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nTHE GREAT MIGRATION TO AMERICA\\n\\n\\nThe tide of migration that set in toward the shores of North America\\nduring the early years of the seventeenth century was but one phase in\\nthe restless and eternal movement of mankind upon the surface of the\\nearth. The ancient Greeks flung out their colonies in every direction,\\nwestward as far as Gaul, across the Mediterranean, and eastward into\\nAsia Minor, perhaps to the very confines of India. The Romans, supported\\nby their armies and their government, spread their dominion beyond the\\nnarrow lands of Italy until it stretched from the heather of Scotland to\\nthe sands of Arabia. The Teutonic tribes, from their home beyond the\\nDanube and the Rhine, poured into the empire of the Caesars and made the\\nbeginnings of modern Europe. Of this great sweep of races and empires\\nthe settlement of America was merely a part. And it was, moreover, only\\none aspect of the expansion which finally carried the peoples, the\\ninstitutions, and the trade of Europe to the very ends of the earth.\\n\\nIn one vital point, it must be noted, American colonization differed\\nfrom that of the ancients. The Greeks usually carried with them\\naffection for the government they left behind and sacred fire from the\\naltar of the parent city; but thousands of the immigrants who came to\\nAmerica disliked the state and disowned the church of the mother\\ncountry. They established compacts of government for themselves and set\\nup altars of their own. They sought not only new soil to till but also\\npolitical and religious liberty for themselves and their children.\\n\\n\\nTHE AGENCIES OF AMERICAN COLONIZATION\\n\\nIt was no light matter for the English to cross three thousand miles of\\nwater and found homes in the American wilderness at the opening of the\\nseventeenth century. Ships, tools, and supplies called for huge outlays\\nof money. Stores had to be furnished in quantities sufficient to sustain\\nthe life of the settlers until they could gather harvests of their own.\\nArtisans and laborers of skill and industry had to be induced to risk\\nthe hazards of the new world. Soldiers were required for defense and\\nmariners for the exploration of inland waters. Leaders of good judgment,\\nadept in managing men, had to be discovered. Altogether such an\\nenterprise demanded capital larger than the ordinary merchant or\\ngentleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to\\nassume. Though in later days, after initial tests had been made, wealthy\\nproprietors were able to establish colonies on their own account, it was\\nthe corporation that furnished the capital and leadership in the\\nbeginning.\\n\\n=The Trading Company.=--English pioneers in exploration found an\\ninstrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers, which\\nhad long been employed in carrying on commerce with foreign countries.\\nSuch a corporation was composed of many persons of different ranks of\\nsociety--noblemen, merchants, and gentlemen--who banded together for a\\nparticular undertaking, each contributing a sum of money and sharing in\\nthe profits of the venture. It was organized under royal authority; it\\nreceived its charter, its grant of land, and its trading privileges from\\nthe king and carried on its operations under his supervision and\\ncontrol. The charter named all the persons originally included in the\\ncorporation and gave them certain powers in the management of its\\naffairs, including the right to admit new members. The company was in\\nfact a little government set up by the king. When the members of the\\ncorporation remained in England, as in the case of the Virginia Company,\\nthey operated through agents sent to the colony. When they came over the\\nseas themselves and settled in America, as in the case of Massachusetts,\\nthey became the direct government of the country they possessed. The\\nstockholders in that instance became the voters and the governor, the\\nchief magistrate.\\n\\n[Illustration: JOHN WINTHROP, GOVERNOR OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY\\nCOMPANY]\\n\\nFour of the thirteen colonies in America owed their origins to the\\ntrading corporation. It was the London Company, created by King James I,\\nin 1606, that laid during the following year the foundations of Virginia\\nat Jamestown. It was under the auspices of their West India Company,\\nchartered in 1621, that the Dutch planted the settlements of the New\\nNetherland in the valley of the Hudson. The founders of Massachusetts\\nwere Puritan leaders and men of affairs whom King Charles I incorporated\\nin 1629 under the title: \"The governor and company of the Massachusetts\\nBay in New England.\" In this case the law did but incorporate a group\\ndrawn together by religious ties. \"We must be knit together as one man,\"\\nwrote John Winthrop, the first Puritan governor in America. Far to the\\nsouth, on the banks of the Delaware River, a Swedish commercial company\\nin 1638 made the beginnings of a settlement, christened New Sweden; it\\nwas destined to pass under the rule of the Dutch, and finally under the\\nrule of William Penn as the proprietary colony of Delaware.\\n\\nIn a certain sense, Georgia may be included among the \"company\\ncolonies.\" It was, however, originally conceived by the moving spirit,\\nJames Oglethorpe, as an asylum for poor men, especially those imprisoned\\nfor debt. To realize this humane purpose, he secured from King George\\nII, in 1732, a royal charter uniting several gentlemen, including\\nhimself, into \"one body politic and corporate,\" known as the \"Trustees\\nfor establishing the colony of Georgia in America.\" In the structure of\\ntheir organization and their methods of government, the trustees did not\\ndiffer materially from the regular companies created for trade and\\ncolonization. Though their purposes were benevolent, their transactions\\nhad to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of business.\\n\\n=The Religious Congregation.=--A second agency which figured largely in\\nthe settlement of America was the religious brotherhood, or\\ncongregation, of men and women brought together in the bonds of a common\\nreligious faith. By one of the strange fortunes of history, this\\ninstitution, founded in the early days of Christianity, proved to be a\\npotent force in the origin and growth of self-government in a land far\\naway from Galilee. \"And the multitude of them that believed were of one\\nheart and of one soul,\" we are told in the Acts describing the Church at\\nJerusalem. \"We are knit together as a body in a most sacred covenant of\\nthe Lord ... by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all\\ncare of each other\\'s good and of the whole,\" wrote John Robinson, a\\nleader among the Pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of Plymouth in\\n1620. The Mayflower Compact, so famous in American history, was but a\\nwritten and signed agreement, incorporating the spirit of obedience to\\nthe common good, which served as a guide to self-government until\\nPlymouth was annexed to Massachusetts in 1691.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE ORIGINAL GRANTS]\\n\\nThree other colonies, all of which retained their identity until the eve\\nof the American Revolution, likewise sprang directly from the\\ncongregations of the faithful: Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New\\nHampshire, mainly offshoots from Massachusetts. They were founded by\\nsmall bodies of men and women, \"united in solemn covenants with the\\nLord,\" who planted their settlements in the wilderness. Not until many a\\nyear after Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson conducted their followers\\nto the Narragansett country was Rhode Island granted a charter of\\nincorporation (1663) by the crown. Not until long after the congregation\\nof Thomas Hooker from Newtown blazed the way into the Connecticut River\\nValley did the king of England give Connecticut a charter of its own\\n(1662) and a place among the colonies. Half a century elapsed before the\\ntowns laid out beyond the Merrimac River by emigrants from Massachusetts\\nwere formed into the royal province of New Hampshire in 1679.\\n\\nEven when Connecticut was chartered, the parchment and sealing wax of\\nthe royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of self-government\\nand obedience to law previously established by the congregations. The\\ntowns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield had long lived happily\\nunder their \"Fundamental Orders\" drawn up by themselves in 1639; so had\\nthe settlers dwelt peacefully at New Haven under their \"Fundamental\\nArticles\" drafted in the same year. The pioneers on the Connecticut\\nshore had no difficulty in agreeing that \"the Scriptures do hold forth a\\nperfect rule for the direction and government of all men.\"\\n\\n=The Proprietor.=--A third and very important colonial agency was the\\nproprietor, or proprietary. As the name, associated with the word\\n\"property,\" implies, the proprietor was a person to whom the king\\ngranted property in lands in North America to have, hold, use, and enjoy\\nfor his own benefit and profit, with the right to hand the estate down\\nto his heirs in perpetual succession. The proprietor was a rich and\\npowerful person, prepared to furnish or secure the capital, collect the\\nships, supply the stores, and assemble the settlers necessary to found\\nand sustain a plantation beyond the seas. Sometimes the proprietor\\nworked alone. Sometimes two or more were associated like partners in the\\ncommon undertaking.\\n\\nFive colonies, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Carolinas,\\nowe their formal origins, though not always their first settlements, nor\\nin most cases their prosperity, to the proprietary system. Maryland,\\nestablished in 1634 under a Catholic nobleman, Lord Baltimore, and\\nblessed with religious toleration by the act of 1649, flourished under\\nthe mild rule of proprietors until it became a state in the American\\nunion. New Jersey, beginning its career under two proprietors, Berkeley\\nand Carteret, in 1664, passed under the direct government of the crown\\nin 1702. Pennsylvania was, in a very large measure, the product of the\\ngenerous spirit and tireless labors of its first proprietor, the leader\\nof the Friends, William Penn, to whom it was granted in 1681 and in\\nwhose family it remained until 1776. The two Carolinas were first\\norganized as one colony in 1663 under the government and patronage of\\neight proprietors, including Lord Clarendon; but after more than half a\\ncentury both became royal provinces governed by the king.\\n\\n[Illustration: WILLIAM PENN, PROPRIETOR OF PENNSYLVANIA]\\n\\n\\nTHE COLONIAL PEOPLES\\n\\n=The English.=--In leadership and origin the thirteen colonies, except\\nNew York and Delaware, were English. During the early days of all, save\\nthese two, the main, if not the sole, current of immigration was from\\nEngland. The colonists came from every walk of life. They were men,\\nwomen, and children of \"all sorts and conditions.\" The major portion\\nwere yeomen, or small land owners, farm laborers, and artisans. With\\nthem were merchants and gentlemen who brought their stocks of goods or\\ntheir fortunes to the New World. Scholars came from Oxford and\\nCambridge to preach the gospel or to teach. Now and then the son of an\\nEnglish nobleman left his baronial hall behind and cast his lot with\\nAmerica. The people represented every religious faith--members of the\\nEstablished Church of England; Puritans who had labored to reform that\\nchurch; Separatists, Baptists, and Friends, who had left it altogether;\\nand Catholics, who clung to the religion of their fathers.\\n\\nNew England was almost purely English. During the years between 1629 and\\n1640, the period of arbitrary Stuart government, about twenty thousand\\nPuritans emigrated to America, settling in the colonies of the far\\nNorth. Although minor additions were made from time to time, the greater\\nportion of the New England people sprang from this original stock.\\nVirginia, too, for a long time drew nearly all her immigrants from\\nEngland alone. Not until the eve of the Revolution did other\\nnationalities, mainly the Scotch-Irish and Germans, rival the English in\\nnumbers.\\n\\nThe populations of later English colonies--the Carolinas, New York,\\nPennsylvania, and Georgia--while receiving a steady stream of\\nimmigration from England, were constantly augmented by wanderers from\\nthe older settlements. New York was invaded by Puritans from New England\\nin such numbers as to cause the Anglican clergymen there to lament that\\n\"free thinking spreads almost as fast as the Church.\" North Carolina was\\nfirst settled toward the northern border by immigrants from Virginia.\\nSome of the North Carolinians, particularly the Quakers, came all the\\nway from New England, tarrying in Virginia only long enough to learn how\\nlittle they were wanted in that Anglican colony.\\n\\n=The Scotch-Irish.=--Next to the English in numbers and influence were\\nthe Scotch-Irish, Presbyterians in belief, English in tongue. Both\\nreligious and economic reasons sent them across the sea. Their Scotch\\nancestors, in the days of Cromwell, had settled in the north of Ireland\\nwhence the native Irish had been driven by the conqueror\\'s sword. There\\nthe Scotch nourished for many years enjoying in peace their own form of\\nreligion and growing prosperous in the manufacture of fine linen and\\nwoolen cloth. Then the blow fell. Toward the end of the seventeenth\\ncentury their religious worship was put under the ban and the export of\\ntheir cloth was forbidden by the English Parliament. Within two decades\\ntwenty thousand Scotch-Irish left Ulster alone, for America; and all\\nduring the eighteenth century the migration continued to be heavy.\\nAlthough no exact record was kept, it is reckoned that the Scotch-Irish\\nand the Scotch who came directly from Scotland, composed one-sixth of\\nthe entire American population on the eve of the Revolution.\\n\\n[Illustration: SETTLEMENTS OF GERMAN AND SCOTCH-IRISH\\nIMMIGRANTS]\\n\\nThese newcomers in America made their homes chiefly in New Jersey,\\nPennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Coming late upon\\nthe scene, they found much of the land immediately upon the seaboard\\nalready taken up. For this reason most of them became frontier people\\nsettling the interior and upland regions. There they cleared the land,\\nlaid out their small farms, and worked as \"sturdy yeomen on the soil,\"\\nhardy, industrious, and independent in spirit, sharing neither the\\nluxuries of the rich planters nor the easy life of the leisurely\\nmerchants. To their agriculture they added woolen and linen\\nmanufactures, which, flourishing in the supple fingers of their tireless\\nwomen, made heavy inroads upon the trade of the English merchants in\\nthe colonies. Of their labors a poet has sung:\\n\\n        \"O, willing hands to toil;\\n    Strong natures tuned to the harvest-song and bound to the kindly soil;\\n    Bold pioneers for the wilderness, defenders in the field.\"\\n\\n=The Germans.=--Third among the colonists in order of numerical\\nimportance were the Germans. From the very beginning, they appeared in\\ncolonial records. A number of the artisans and carpenters in the first\\nJamestown colony were of German descent. Peter Minuit, the famous\\ngovernor of New Motherland, was a German from Wesel on the Rhine, and\\nJacob Leisler, leader of a popular uprising against the provincial\\nadministration of New York, was a German from Frankfort-on-Main. The\\nwholesale migration of Germans began with the founding of Pennsylvania.\\nPenn was diligent in searching for thrifty farmers to cultivate his\\nlands and he made a special effort to attract peasants from the Rhine\\ncountry. A great association, known as the Frankfort Company, bought\\nmore than twenty thousand acres from him and in 1684 established a\\ncenter at Germantown for the distribution of German immigrants. In old\\nNew York, Rhinebeck-on-the-Hudson became a similar center for\\ndistribution. All the way from Maine to Georgia inducements were offered\\nto the German farmers and in nearly every colony were to be found, in\\ntime, German settlements. In fact the migration became so large that\\nGerman princes were frightened at the loss of so many subjects and\\nEngland was alarmed by the influx of foreigners into her overseas\\ndominions. Yet nothing could stop the movement. By the end of the\\ncolonial period, the number of Germans had risen to more than two\\nhundred thousand.\\n\\nThe majority of them were Protestants from the Rhine region, and South\\nGermany. Wars, religious controversies, oppression, and poverty drove\\nthem forth to America. Though most of them were farmers, there were also\\namong them skilled artisans who contributed to the rapid growth of\\nindustries in Pennsylvania. Their iron, glass, paper, and woolen mills,\\ndotted here and there among the thickly settled regions, added to the\\nwealth and independence of the province.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n\\nA GLIMPSE OF OLD GERMANTOWN]\\n\\nUnlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans did not speak the language of the\\noriginal colonists or mingle freely with them. They kept to themselves,\\nbuilt their own schools, founded their own newspapers, and published\\ntheir own books. Their clannish habits often irritated their neighbors\\nand led to occasional agitations against \"foreigners.\" However, no\\nserious collisions seem to have occurred; and in the days of the\\nRevolution, German soldiers from Pennsylvania fought in the patriot\\narmies side by side with soldiers from the English and Scotch-Irish\\nsections.\\n\\n=Other Nationalities.=--Though the English, the Scotch-Irish, and the\\nGermans made up the bulk of the colonial population, there were other\\nracial strains as well, varying in numerical importance but contributing\\ntheir share to colonial life.\\n\\nFrom France came the Huguenots fleeing from the decree of the king which\\ninflicted terrible penalties upon Protestants.\\n\\nFrom \"Old Ireland\" came thousands of native Irish, Celtic in race and\\nCatholic in religion. Like their Scotch-Irish neighbors to the north,\\nthey revered neither the government nor the church of England imposed\\nupon them by the sword. How many came we do not know, but shipping\\nrecords of the colonial period show that boatload after boatload left\\nthe southern and eastern shores of Ireland for the New World.\\nUndoubtedly thousands of their passengers were Irish of the native\\nstock. This surmise is well sustained by the constant appearance of\\nCeltic names in the records of various colonies.\\n\\n[Illustration:_From an old print_\\n\\nOLD DUTCH FORT AND ENGLISH CHURCH NEAR ALBANY]\\n\\nThe Jews, then as ever engaged in their age-long battle for religious\\nand economic toleration, found in the American colonies, not complete\\nliberty, but certainly more freedom than they enjoyed in England,\\nFrance, Spain, or Portugal. The English law did not actually recognize\\ntheir right to live in any of the dominions, but owing to the easy-going\\nhabits of the Americans they were allowed to filter into the seaboard\\ntowns. The treatment they received there varied. On one occasion the\\nmayor and council of New York forbade them to sell by retail and on\\nanother prohibited the exercise of their religious worship. Newport,\\nPhiladelphia, and Charleston were more hospitable, and there large\\nJewish colonies, consisting principally of merchants and their families,\\nflourished in spite of nominal prohibitions of the law.\\n\\nThough the small Swedish colony in Delaware was quickly submerged\\nbeneath the tide of English migration, the Dutch in New York continued\\nto hold their own for more than a hundred years after the English\\nconquest in 1664. At the end of the colonial period over one-half of the\\n170,000 inhabitants of the province were descendants of the original\\nDutch--still distinct enough to give a decided cast to the life and\\nmanners of New York. Many of them clung as tenaciously to their mother\\ntongue as they did to their capacious farmhouses or their Dutch ovens;\\nbut they were slowly losing their identity as the English pressed in\\nbeside them to farm and trade.\\n\\nThe melting pot had begun its historic mission.\\n\\n\\nTHE PROCESS OF COLONIZATION\\n\\nConsidered from one side, colonization, whatever the motives of the\\nemigrants, was an economic matter. It involved the use of capital to pay\\nfor their passage, to sustain them on the voyage, and to start them on\\nthe way of production. Under this stern economic necessity, Puritans,\\nScotch-Irish, Germans, and all were alike laid.\\n\\n=Immigrants Who Paid Their Own Way.=--Many of the immigrants to America\\nin colonial days were capitalists themselves, in a small or a large way,\\nand paid their own passage. What proportion of the colonists were able\\nto finance their voyage across the sea is a matter of pure conjecture.\\nUndoubtedly a very considerable number could do so, for we can trace the\\nfamily fortunes of many early settlers. Henry Cabot Lodge is authority\\nfor the statement that \"the settlers of New England were drawn from the\\ncountry gentlemen, small farmers, and yeomanry of the mother\\ncountry.... Many of the emigrants were men of wealth, as the old lists\\nshow, and all of them, with few exceptions, were men of property and\\ngood standing. They did not belong to the classes from which emigration\\nis usually supplied, for they all had a stake in the country they left\\nbehind.\" Though it would be interesting to know how accurate this\\nstatement is or how applicable to the other colonies, no study has as\\nyet been made to gratify that interest. For the present it is an\\nunsolved problem just how many of the colonists were able to bear the\\ncost of their own transfer to the New World.\\n\\n=Indentured Servants.=--That at least tens of thousands of immigrants\\nwere unable to pay for their passage is established beyond the shadow of\\na doubt by the shipping records that have come down to us. The great\\nbarrier in the way of the poor who wanted to go to America was the cost\\nof the sea voyage. To overcome this difficulty a plan was worked out\\nwhereby shipowners and other persons of means furnished the passage\\nmoney to immigrants in return for their promise, or bond, to work for a\\nterm of years to repay the sum advanced. This system was called\\nindentured servitude.\\n\\nIt is probable that the number of bond servants exceeded the original\\ntwenty thousand Puritans, the yeomen, the Virginia gentlemen, and the\\nHuguenots combined. All the way down the coast from Massachusetts to\\nGeorgia were to be found in the fields, kitchens, and workshops, men,\\nwomen, and children serving out terms of bondage generally ranging from\\nfive to seven years. In the proprietary colonies the proportion of bond\\nservants was very high. The Baltimores, Penns, Carterets, and other\\npromoters anxiously sought for workers of every nationality to till\\ntheir fields, for land without labor was worth no more than land in the\\nmoon. Hence the gates of the proprietary colonies were flung wide open.\\nEvery inducement was offered to immigrants in the form of cheap land,\\nand special efforts were made to increase the population by importing\\nservants. In Pennsylvania, it was not uncommon to find a master with\\nfifty bond servants on his estate. It has been estimated that two-thirds\\nof all the immigrants into Pennsylvania between the opening of the\\neighteenth century and the outbreak of the Revolution were in bondage.\\nIn the other Middle colonies the number was doubtless not so large; but\\nit formed a considerable part of the population.\\n\\nThe story of this traffic in white servants is one of the most striking\\nthings in the history of labor. Bondmen differed from the serfs of the\\nfeudal age in that they were not bound to the soil but to the master.\\nThey likewise differed from the negro slaves in that their servitude had\\na time limit. Still they were subject to many special disabilities. It\\nwas, for instance, a common practice to impose on them penalties far\\nheavier than were imposed upon freemen for the same offense. A free\\ncitizen of Pennsylvania who indulged in horse racing and gambling was\\nlet off with a fine; a white servant guilty of the same unlawful conduct\\nwas whipped at the post and fined as well.\\n\\nThe ordinary life of the white servant was also severely restricted. A\\nbondman could not marry without his master\\'s consent; nor engage in\\ntrade; nor refuse work assigned to him. For an attempt to escape or\\nindeed for any infraction of the law, the term of service was extended.\\nThe condition of white bondmen in Virginia, according to Lodge, \"was\\nlittle better than that of slaves. Loose indentures and harsh laws put\\nthem at the mercy of their masters.\" It would not be unfair to add that\\nsuch was their lot in all other colonies. Their fate depended upon the\\ntemper of their masters.\\n\\nCruel as was the system in many ways, it gave thousands of people in the\\nOld World a chance to reach the New--an opportunity to wrestle with fate\\nfor freedom and a home of their own. When their weary years of servitude\\nwere over, if they survived, they might obtain land of their own or\\nsettle as free mechanics in the towns. For many a bondman the gamble\\nproved to be a losing venture because he found himself unable to rise\\nout of the state of poverty and dependence into which his servitude\\ncarried him. For thousands, on the contrary, bondage proved to be a real\\navenue to freedom and prosperity. Some of the best citizens of America\\nhave the blood of indentured servants in their veins.\\n\\n=The Transported--Involuntary Servitude.=--In their anxiety to secure\\nsettlers, the companies and proprietors having colonies in America\\neither resorted to or connived at the practice of kidnapping men, women,\\nand children from the streets of English cities. In 1680 it was\\nofficially estimated that \"ten thousand persons were spirited away\" to\\nAmerica. Many of the victims of the practice were young children, for\\nthe traffic in them was highly profitable. Orphans and dependents were\\nsometimes disposed of in America by relatives unwilling to support them.\\nIn a single year, 1627, about fifteen hundred children were shipped to\\nVirginia.\\n\\nIn this gruesome business there lurked many tragedies, and very few\\nromances. Parents were separated from their children and husbands from\\ntheir wives. Hundreds of skilled artisans--carpenters, smiths, and\\nweavers--utterly disappeared as if swallowed up by death. A few thus\\ndragged off to the New World to be sold into servitude for a term of\\nfive or seven years later became prosperous and returned home with\\nfortunes. In one case a young man who was forcibly carried over the sea\\nlived to make his way back to England and establish his claim to a\\npeerage.\\n\\nAkin to the kidnapped, at least in economic position, were convicts\\ndeported to the colonies for life in lieu of fines and imprisonment. The\\nAmericans protested vigorously but ineffectually against this practice.\\nIndeed, they exaggerated its evils, for many of the \"criminals\" were\\nonly mild offenders against unduly harsh and cruel laws. A peasant\\ncaught shooting a rabbit on a lord\\'s estate or a luckless servant girl\\nwho purloined a pocket handkerchief was branded as a criminal along with\\nsturdy thieves and incorrigible rascals. Other transported offenders\\nwere \"political criminals\"; that is, persons who criticized or opposed\\nthe government. This class included now Irish who revolted against\\nBritish rule in Ireland; now Cavaliers who championed the king against\\nthe Puritan revolutionists; Puritans, in turn, dispatched after the\\nmonarchy was restored; and Scotch and English subjects in general who\\njoined in political uprisings against the king.\\n\\n=The African Slaves.=--Rivaling in numbers, in the course of time, the\\nindentured servants and whites carried to America against their will\\nwere the African negroes brought to America and sold into slavery. When\\nthis form of bondage was first introduced into Virginia in 1619, it was\\nlooked upon as a temporary necessity to be discarded with the increase\\nof the white population. Moreover it does not appear that those planters\\nwho first bought negroes at the auction block intended to establish a\\nsystem of permanent bondage. Only by a slow process did chattel slavery\\ntake firm root and become recognized as the leading source of the labor\\nsupply. In 1650, thirty years after the introduction of slavery, there\\nwere only three hundred Africans in Virginia.\\n\\nThe great increase in later years was due in no small measure to the\\ninordinate zeal for profits that seized slave traders both in Old and in\\nNew England. Finding it relatively easy to secure negroes in Africa,\\nthey crowded the Southern ports with their vessels. The English Royal\\nAfrican Company sent to America annually between 1713 and 1743 from five\\nto ten thousand slaves. The ship owners of New England were not far\\nbehind their English brethren in pushing this extraordinary traffic.\\n\\nAs the proportion of the negroes to the free white population steadily\\nrose, and as whole sections were overrun with slaves and slave traders,\\nthe Southern colonies grew alarmed. In 1710, Virginia sought to curtail\\nthe importation by placing a duty of $5 on each slave. This effort was\\nfutile, for the royal governor promptly vetoed it. From time to time\\nsimilar bills were passed, only to meet with royal disapproval. South\\nCarolina, in 1760, absolutely prohibited importation; but the measure\\nwas killed by the British crown. As late as 1772, Virginia, not daunted\\nby a century of rebuffs, sent to George III a petition in this vein:\\n\"The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of Africa\\nhath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity and under its\\npresent encouragement, we have too much reason to fear, will endanger\\nthe very existence of Your Majesty\\'s American dominions.... Deeply\\nimpressed with these sentiments, we most humbly beseech Your Majesty to\\nremove all those restraints on Your Majesty\\'s governors of this colony\\nwhich inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very\\npernicious a commerce.\"\\n\\nAll such protests were without avail. The negro population grew by leaps\\nand bounds, until on the eve of the Revolution it amounted to more than\\nhalf a million. In five states--Maryland, Virginia, the two Carolinas,\\nand Georgia--the slaves nearly equalled or actually exceeded the whites\\nin number. In South Carolina they formed almost two-thirds of the\\npopulation. Even in the Middle colonies of Delaware and Pennsylvania\\nabout one-fifth of the inhabitants were from Africa. To the North, the\\nproportion of slaves steadily diminished although chattel servitude was\\non the same legal footing as in the South. In New York approximately one\\nin six and in New England one in fifty were negroes, including a few\\nfreedmen.\\n\\nThe climate, the soil, the commerce, and the industry of the North were\\nall unfavorable to the growth of a servile population. Still, slavery,\\nthough sectional, was a part of the national system of economy. Northern\\nships carried slaves to the Southern colonies and the produce of the\\nplantations to Europe. \"If the Northern states will consult their\\ninterest, they will not oppose the increase in slaves which will\\nincrease the commodities of which they will become the carriers,\" said\\nJohn Rutledge, of South Carolina, in the convention which framed the\\nConstitution of the United States. \"What enriches a part enriches the\\nwhole and the states are the best judges of their particular interest,\"\\nresponded Oliver Ellsworth, the distinguished spokesman of Connecticut.\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nE.

The feudal and\\naristocratic societies of Europe were founded on a system of landlordism\\nwhich was characterized by two distinct features. In the first place,\\nthe land was nearly all held in great estates, each owned by a single\\nproprietor. In the second place, every estate was kept intact under the\\nlaw of primogeniture, which at the death of a lord transferred all his\\nlanded property to his eldest son. This prevented the subdivision of\\nestates and the growth of a large body of small farmers or freeholders\\nowning their own land. It made a form of tenantry or servitude\\ninevitable for the mass of those who labored on the land. It also\\nenabled the landlords to maintain themselves in power as a governing\\nclass and kept the tenants and laborers subject to their economic and\\npolitical control. If land tenure was so significant in Europe, it was\\nequally important in the development of America, where practically all\\nthe first immigrants were forced by circumstances to derive their\\nlivelihood from the soil.\\n\\n=Experiments in Common Tillage.=--In the New World, with its broad\\nextent of land awaiting the white man\\'s plow, it was impossible to\\nintroduce in its entirety and over the whole area the system of lords\\nand tenants that existed across the sea. So it happened that almost\\nevery kind of experiment in land tenure, from communism to feudalism,\\nwas tried. In the early days of the Jamestown colony, the land, though\\nowned by the London Company, was tilled in common by the settlers. No\\nman had a separate plot of his own. The motto of the community was:\\n\"Labor and share alike.\" All were supposed to work in the fields and\\nreceive an equal share of the produce. At Plymouth, the Pilgrims\\nattempted a similar experiment, laying out the fields in common and\\ndistributing the joint produce of their labor with rough equality among\\nthe workers.\\n\\nIn both colonies the communistic experiments were failures. Angry at the\\nlazy men in Jamestown who idled their time away and yet expected regular\\nmeals, Captain John Smith issued a manifesto: \"Everyone that gathereth\\nnot every day as much as I do, the next day shall be set beyond the\\nriver and forever banished from the fort and live there or starve.\" Even\\nthis terrible threat did not bring a change in production. Not until\\neach man was given a plot of his own to till, not until each gathered\\nthe fruits of his own labor, did the colony prosper. In Plymouth, where\\nthe communal experiment lasted for five years, the results were similar\\nto those in Virginia, and the system was given up for one of separate\\nfields in which every person could \"set corn for his own particular.\"\\nSome other New England towns, refusing to profit by the experience of\\ntheir Plymouth neighbor, also made excursions into common ownership and\\nlabor, only to abandon the idea and go in for individual ownership of\\nthe land. \"By degrees it was seen that even the Lord\\'s people could not\\ncarry the complicated communist legislation into perfect and wholesome\\npractice.\"\\n\\n=Feudal Elements in the Colonies--Quit Rents, Manors, and\\nPlantations.=--At the other end of the scale were the feudal elements of\\nland tenure found in the proprietary colonies, in the seaboard regions\\nof the South, and to some extent in New York. The proprietor was in fact\\na powerful feudal lord, owning land granted to him by royal charter. He\\ncould retain any part of it for his personal use or dispose of it all in\\nlarge or small lots. While he generally kept for himself an estate of\\nbaronial proportions, it was impossible for him to manage directly any\\nconsiderable part of the land in his dominion. Consequently he either\\nsold it in parcels for lump sums or granted it to individuals on\\ncondition that they make to him an annual payment in money, known as\\n\"quit rent.\" In Maryland, the proprietor sometimes collected as high as\\n$9000 (equal to about $500,000 to-day) in a single year from this\\nsource. In Pennsylvania, the quit rents brought a handsome annual\\ntribute into the exchequer of the Penn family. In the royal provinces,\\nthe king of England claimed all revenues collected in this form from the\\nland, a sum amounting to $19,000 at the time of the Revolution. The quit\\nrent,--\"really a feudal payment from freeholders,\"--was thus a material\\nsource of income for the crown as well as for the proprietors. Wherever\\nit was laid, however, it proved to be a burden, a source of constant\\nirritation; and it became a formidable item in the long list of\\ngrievances which led to the American Revolution.\\n\\nSomething still more like the feudal system of the Old World appeared in\\nthe numerous manors or the huge landed estates granted by the crown, the\\ncompanies, or the proprietors. In the colony of Maryland alone there\\nwere sixty manors of three thousand acres each, owned by wealthy men and\\ntilled by tenants holding small plots under certain restrictions of\\ntenure. In New York also there were many manors of wide extent, most of\\nwhich originated in the days of the Dutch West India Company, when\\nextensive concessions were made to patroons to induce them to bring over\\nsettlers. The Van Rensselaer, the Van Cortlandt, and the Livingston\\nmanors were so large and populous that each was entitled to send a\\nrepresentative to the provincial legislature. The tenants on the New\\nYork manors were in somewhat the same position as serfs on old European\\nestates. They were bound to pay the owner a rent in money and kind; they\\nground their grain at his mill; and they were subject to his judicial\\npower because he held court and meted out justice, in some instances\\nextending to capital punishment.\\n\\nThe manors of New York or Maryland were, however, of slight consequence\\nas compared with the vast plantations of the Southern seaboard--huge\\nestates, far wider in expanse than many a European barony and tilled by\\nslaves more servile than any feudal tenants. It must not be forgotten\\nthat this system of land tenure became the dominant feature of a large\\nsection and gave a decided bent to the economic and political life of\\nAmerica.\\n\\n[Illustration: SOUTHERN PLANTATION MANSION]\\n\\n=The Small Freehold.=--In the upland regions of the South, however, and\\nthroughout most of the North, the drift was against all forms of\\nservitude and tenantry and in the direction of the freehold; that is,\\nthe small farm owned outright and tilled by the possessor and his\\nfamily. This was favored by natural circumstances and the spirit of the\\nimmigrants. For one thing, the abundance of land and the scarcity of\\nlabor made it impossible for the companies, the proprietors, or the\\ncrown to develop over the whole continent a network of vast estates. In\\nmany sections, particularly in New England, the climate, the stony soil,\\nthe hills, and the narrow valleys conspired to keep the farms within a\\nmoderate compass. For another thing, the English, Scotch-Irish, and\\nGerman peasants, even if they had been tenants in the Old World, did not\\npropose to accept permanent dependency of any kind in the New. If they\\ncould not get freeholds, they would not settle at all; thus they forced\\nproprietors and companies to bid for their enterprise by selling land in\\nsmall lots. So it happened that the freehold of modest proportions\\nbecame the cherished unit of American farmers. The people who tilled the\\nfarms were drawn from every quarter of western Europe; but the freehold\\nsystem gave a uniform cast to their economic and social life in America.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n\\nA NEW ENGLAND FARMHOUSE]\\n\\n=Social Effects of Land Tenure.=--Land tenure and the process of western\\nsettlement thus developed two distinct types of people engaged in the\\nsame pursuit--agriculture. They had a common tie in that they both\\ncultivated the soil and possessed the local interest and independence\\nwhich arise from that occupation. Their methods and their culture,\\nhowever, differed widely.\\n\\nThe Southern planter, on his broad acres tilled by slaves, resembled the\\nEnglish landlord on his estates more than he did the colonial farmer who\\nlabored with his own hands in the fields and forests. He sold his rice\\nand tobacco in large amounts directly to English factors, who took his\\nentire crop in exchange for goods and cash. His fine clothes,\\nsilverware, china, and cutlery he bought in English markets. Loving the\\nripe old culture of the mother country, he often sent his sons to Oxford\\nor Cambridge for their education. In short, he depended very largely for\\nhis prosperity and his enjoyment of life upon close relations with the\\nOld World. He did not even need market towns in which to buy native\\ngoods, for they were made on his own plantation by his own artisans who\\nwere usually gifted slaves.\\n\\nThe economic condition of the small farmer was totally different. His\\ncrops were not big enough to warrant direct connection with English\\nfactors or the personal maintenance of a corps of artisans. He needed\\nlocal markets, and they sprang up to meet the need. Smiths, hatters,\\nweavers, wagon-makers, and potters at neighboring towns supplied him\\nwith the rough products of their native skill. The finer goods, bought\\nby the rich planter in England, the small farmer ordinarily could not\\nbuy. His wants were restricted to staples like tea and sugar, and\\nbetween him and the European market stood the merchant. His community\\nwas therefore more self-sufficient than the seaboard line of great\\nplantations. It was more isolated, more provincial, more independent,\\nmore American. The planter faced the Old East. The farmer faced the New\\nWest.\\n\\n=The Westward Movement.=--Yeoman and planter nevertheless were alike in\\none respect. Their land hunger was never appeased. Each had the eye of\\nan expert for new and fertile soil; and so, north and south, as soon as\\na foothold was secured on the Atlantic coast, the current of migration\\nset in westward, creeping through forests, across rivers, and over\\nmountains. Many of the later immigrants, in their search for cheap\\nlands, were compelled to go to the border; but in a large part the path\\nbreakers to the West were native Americans of the second and third\\ngenerations. Explorers, fired by curiosity and the lure of the\\nmysterious unknown, and hunters, fur traders, and squatters, following\\ntheir own sweet wills, blazed the trail, opening paths and sending back\\nstories of the new regions they traversed. Then came the regular\\nsettlers with lawful titles to the lands they had purchased, sometimes\\nsingly and sometimes in companies.\\n\\nIn Massachusetts, the westward movement is recorded in the founding of\\nSpringfield in 1636 and Great Barrington in 1725. By the opening of the\\neighteenth century the pioneers of Connecticut had pushed north and west\\nuntil their outpost towns adjoined the Hudson Valley settlements. In New\\nYork, the inland movement was directed by the Hudson River to Albany,\\nand from that old Dutch center it radiated in every direction,\\nparticularly westward through the Mohawk Valley. New Jersey was early\\nfilled to its borders, the beginnings of the present city of New\\nBrunswick being made in 1681 and those of Trenton in 1685. In\\nPennsylvania, as in New York, the waterways determined the main lines of\\nadvance. Pioneers, pushing up through the valley of the Schuylkill,\\nspread over the fertile lands of Berks and Lancaster counties, laying\\nout Reading in 1748. Another current of migration was directed by the\\nSusquehanna, and, in 1726, the first farmhouse was built on the bank\\nwhere Harrisburg was later founded. Along the southern tier of counties\\na thin line of settlements stretched westward to Pittsburgh, reaching\\nthe upper waters of the Ohio while the colony was still under the Penn\\nfamily.\\n\\nIn the South the westward march was equally swift. The seaboard was\\nquickly occupied by large planters and their slaves engaged in the\\ncultivation of tobacco and rice. The Piedmont Plateau, lying back from\\nthe coast all the way from Maryland to Georgia, was fed by two streams\\nof migration, one westward from the sea and the other southward from the\\nother colonies--Germans from Pennsylvania and Scotch-Irish furnishing\\nthe main supply. \"By 1770, tide-water Virginia was full to overflowing\\nand the \\'back country\\' of the Blue Ridge and the Shenandoah was fully\\noccupied. Even the mountain valleys ... were claimed by sturdy pioneers.\\nBefore the Declaration of Independence, the oncoming tide of\\nhome-seekers had reached the crest of the Alleghanies.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, 1790]\\n\\nBeyond the mountains pioneers had already ventured, harbingers of an\\ninvasion that was about to break in upon Kentucky and Tennessee. As\\nearly as 1769 that mighty Nimrod, Daniel Boone, curious to hunt\\nbuffaloes, of which he had heard weird reports, passed through the\\nCumberland Gap and brought back news of a wonderful country awaiting the\\nplow. A hint was sufficient. Singly, in pairs, and in groups, settlers\\nfollowed the trail he had blazed. A great land corporation, the\\nTransylvania Company, emulating the merchant adventurers of earlier\\ntimes, secured a huge grant of territory and sought profits in quit\\nrents from lands sold to farmers. By the outbreak of the Revolution\\nthere were several hundred people in the Kentucky region. Like the older\\ncolonists, they did not relish quit rents, and their opposition wrecked\\nthe Transylvania Company. They even carried their protests into the\\nContinental Congress in 1776, for by that time they were our \"embryo\\nfourteenth colony.\"\\n\\n\\nINDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT\\n\\nThough the labor of the colonists was mainly spent in farming, there was\\na steady growth in industrial and commercial pursuits. Most of the\\nstaple industries of to-day, not omitting iron and textiles, have their\\nbeginnings in colonial times. Manufacturing and trade soon gave rise to\\ntowns which enjoyed an importance all out of proportion to their\\nnumbers. The great centers of commerce and finance on the seaboard\\noriginated in the days when the king of England was \"lord of these\\ndominions.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: DOMESTIC INDUSTRY: DIPPING TALLOW CANDLES]\\n\\n=Textile Manufacture as a Domestic Industry.=--Colonial women, in\\naddition to sharing every hardship of pioneering, often the heavy labor\\nof the open field, developed in the course of time a national industry\\nwhich was almost exclusively their own. Wool and flax were raised in\\nabundance in the North and South. \"Every farm house,\" says Coman, the\\neconomic historian, \"was a workshop where the women spun and wove the\\nserges, kerseys, and linsey-woolseys which served for the common wear.\"\\nBy the close of the seventeenth century, New England manufactured cloth\\nin sufficient quantities to export it to the Southern colonies and to\\nthe West Indies. As the industry developed, mills were erected for the\\nmore difficult process of dyeing, weaving, and fulling, but carding and\\nspinning continued to be done in the home. The Dutch of New Netherland,\\nthe Swedes of Delaware, and the Scotch-Irish of the interior \"were not\\none whit behind their Yankee neighbors.\"\\n\\nThe importance of this enterprise to British economic life can hardly be\\noverestimated. For many a century the English had employed their fine\\nwoolen cloth as the chief staple in a lucrative foreign trade, and the\\ngovernment had come to look upon it as an object of special interest and\\nprotection. When the colonies were established, both merchants and\\nstatesmen naturally expected to maintain a monopoly of increasing value;\\nbut before long the Americans, instead of buying cloth, especially of\\nthe coarser varieties, were making it to sell. In the place of\\ncustomers, here were rivals. In the place of helpless reliance upon\\nEnglish markets, here was the germ of economic independence.\\n\\nIf British merchants had not discovered it in the ordinary course of\\ntrade, observant officers in the provinces would have conveyed the news\\nto them. Even in the early years of the eighteenth century the royal\\ngovernor of New York wrote of the industrious Americans to his home\\ngovernment: \"The consequence will be that if they can clothe themselves\\nonce, not only comfortably, but handsomely too, without the help of\\nEngland, they who already are not very fond of submitting to government\\nwill soon think of putting in execution designs they have long harboured\\nin their breasts. This will not seem strange when you consider what sort\\nof people this country is inhabited by.\"\\n\\n=The Iron Industry.=--Almost equally widespread was the art of iron\\nworking--one of the earliest and most picturesque of colonial\\nindustries. Lynn, Massachusetts, had a forge and skilled artisans within\\nfifteen years after the founding of Boston. The smelting of iron began\\nat New London and New Haven about 1658; in Litchfield county,\\nConnecticut, a few years later; at Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in\\n1731; and near by at Lenox some thirty years after that. New Jersey had\\niron works at Shrewsbury within ten years after the founding of the\\ncolony in 1665. Iron forges appeared in the valleys of the Delaware and\\nthe Susquehanna early in the following century, and iron masters then\\nlaid the foundations of fortunes in a region destined to become one of\\nthe great iron centers of the world. Virginia began iron working in the\\nyear that saw the introduction of slavery. Although the industry soon\\nlapsed, it was renewed and flourished in the eighteenth century.\\nGovernor Spotswood was called the \"Tubal Cain\" of the Old Dominion\\nbecause he placed the industry on a firm foundation. Indeed it seems\\nthat every colony, except Georgia, had its iron foundry. Nails, wire,\\nmetallic ware, chains, anchors, bar and pig iron were made in large\\nquantities; and Great Britain, by an act in 1750, encouraged the\\ncolonists to export rough iron to the British Islands.\\n\\n=Shipbuilding.=--Of all the specialized industries in the colonies,\\nshipbuilding was the most important. The abundance of fir for masts, oak\\nfor timbers and boards, pitch for tar and turpentine, and hemp for rope\\nmade the way of the shipbuilder easy. Early in the seventeenth century a\\nship was built at New Amsterdam, and by the middle of that century\\nshipyards were scattered along the New England coast at Newburyport,\\nSalem, New Bedford, Newport, Providence, New London, and New Haven.\\nYards at Albany and Poughkeepsie in New York built ships for the trade\\nof that colony with England and the Indies. Wilmington and Philadelphia\\nsoon entered the race and outdistanced New York, though unable to equal\\nthe pace set by New England. While Maryland, Virginia, and South\\nCarolina also built ships, Southern interest was mainly confined to the\\nlucrative business of producing ship materials: fir, cedar, hemp, and\\ntar.\\n\\n=Fishing.=--The greatest single economic resource of New England outside\\nof agriculture was the fisheries. This industry, started by hardy\\nsailors from Europe, long before the landing of the Pilgrims, flourished\\nunder the indomitable seamanship of the Puritans, who labored with the\\nnet and the harpoon in almost every quarter of the Atlantic. \"Look,\"\\nexclaimed Edmund Burke, in the House of Commons, \"at the manner in\\nwhich the people of New England have of late carried on the whale\\nfishery. Whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice and\\nbehold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of Hudson\\'s Bay\\nand Davis\\'s Straits, while we are looking for them beneath the arctic\\ncircle, we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar\\ncold, that they are at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen\\nserpent of the south.... Nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging\\nto them than the accumulated winter of both poles. We know that, whilst\\nsome of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of\\nAfrica, others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along\\nthe coast of Brazil. No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries. No\\nclimate that is not witness to their toils. Neither the perseverance of\\nHolland nor the activity of France nor the dexterous and firm sagacity\\nof English enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hard\\nindustry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent\\npeople.\"\\n\\nThe influence of the business was widespread. A large and lucrative\\nEuropean trade was built upon it. The better quality of the fish caught\\nfor food was sold in the markets of Spain, Portugal, and Italy, or\\nexchanged for salt, lemons, and raisins for the American market. The\\nlower grades of fish were carried to the West Indies for slave\\nconsumption, and in part traded for sugar and molasses, which furnished\\nthe raw materials for the thriving rum industry of New England. These\\nactivities, in turn, stimulated shipbuilding, steadily enlarging the\\ndemand for fishing and merchant craft of every kind and thus keeping the\\nshipwrights, calkers, rope makers, and other artisans of the seaport\\ntowns rushed with work. They also increased trade with the mother\\ncountry for, out of the cash collected in the fish markets of Europe and\\nthe West Indies, the colonists paid for English manufactures. So an\\never-widening circle of American enterprise centered around this single\\nindustry, the nursery of seamanship and the maritime spirit.\\n\\n=Oceanic Commerce and American Merchants.=--All through the eighteenth\\ncentury, the commerce of the American colonies spread in every direction\\nuntil it rivaled in the number of people employed, the capital engaged,\\nand the profits gleaned, the commerce of European nations. A modern\\nhistorian has said: \"The enterprising merchants of New England developed\\na network of trade routes that covered well-nigh half the world.\" This\\ncommerce, destined to be of such significance in the conflict with the\\nmother country, presented, broadly speaking, two aspects.\\n\\nOn the one side, it involved the export of raw materials and\\nagricultural produce. The Southern colonies produced for shipping,\\ntobacco, rice, tar, pitch, and pine; the Middle colonies, grain, flour,\\nfurs, lumber, and salt pork; New England, fish, flour, rum, furs, shoes,\\nand small articles of manufacture. The variety of products was in fact\\nastounding. A sarcastic writer, while sneering at the idea of an\\nAmerican union, once remarked of colonial trade: \"What sort of dish will\\nyou make? New England will throw in fish and onions. The middle states,\\nflax-seed and flour. Maryland and Virginia will add tobacco. North\\nCarolina, pitch, tar, and turpentine. South Carolina, rice and indigo,\\nand Georgia will sprinkle the whole composition with sawdust. Such an\\nabsurd jumble will you make if you attempt to form a union among such\\ndiscordant materials as the thirteen British provinces.\"\\n\\nOn the other side, American commerce involved the import trade,\\nconsisting principally of English and continental manufactures, tea, and\\n\"India goods.\" Sugar and molasses, brought from the West Indies,\\nsupplied the flourishing distilleries of Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\\nand Connecticut. The carriage of slaves from Africa to the Southern\\ncolonies engaged hundreds of New England\\'s sailors and thousands of\\npounds of her capital.\\n\\nThe disposition of imported goods in the colonies, though in part\\ncontrolled by English factors located in America, employed also a large\\nand important body of American merchants like the Willings and Morrises\\nof Philadelphia; the Amorys, Hancocks, and Faneuils of Boston; and the\\nLivingstons and Lows of New York. In their zeal and enterprise, they\\nwere worthy rivals of their English competitors, so celebrated for\\nworld-wide commercial operations. Though fully aware of the advantages\\nthey enjoyed in British markets and under the protection of the British\\nnavy, the American merchants were high-spirited and mettlesome, ready to\\ncontend with royal officers in order to shield American interests\\nagainst outside interference.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE DUTCH WEST INDIA WAREHOUSE IN NEW AMSTERDAM\\n(NEW YORK CITY)]\\n\\nMeasured against the immense business of modern times, colonial commerce\\nseems perhaps trivial. That, however, is not the test of its\\nsignificance. It must be considered in relation to the growth of English\\ncolonial trade in its entirety--a relation which can be shown by a few\\nstartling figures. The whole export trade of England, including that to\\nthe colonies, was, in 1704, $6,509,000. On the eve of the American\\nRevolution, namely, in 1772, English exports to the American colonies\\nalone amounted to $6,024,000; in other words, almost as much as the\\nwhole foreign business of England two generations before. At the first\\ndate, colonial trade was but one-twelfth of the English export business;\\nat the second date, it was considerably more than one-third. In 1704,\\nPennsylvania bought in English markets goods to the value of $11,459; in\\n1772 the purchases of the same colony amounted to $507,909. In short,\\nPennsylvania imports increased fifty times within sixty-eight years,\\namounting in 1772 to almost the entire export trade of England to the\\ncolonies at the opening of the century. The American colonies were\\nindeed a great source of wealth to English merchants.\\n\\n=Intercolonial Commerce.=--Although the bad roads of colonial times made\\noverland transportation difficult and costly, the many rivers and\\nharbors along the coast favored a lively water-borne trade among the\\ncolonies. The Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehanna rivers in\\nthe North and the many smaller rivers in the South made it possible for\\ngoods to be brought from, and carried to, the interior regions in little\\nsailing vessels with comparative ease. Sloops laden with manufactures,\\ndomestic and foreign, collected at some city like Providence, New York,\\nor Philadelphia, skirted the coasts, visited small ports, and sailed up\\nthe navigable rivers to trade with local merchants who had for exchange\\nthe raw materials which they had gathered in from neighboring farms.\\nLarger ships carried the grain, live stock, cloth, and hardware of New\\nEngland to the Southern colonies, where they were traded for tobacco,\\nleather, tar, and ship timber. From the harbors along the Connecticut\\nshores there were frequent sailings down through Long Island Sound to\\nMaryland, Virginia, and the distant Carolinas.\\n\\n=Growth of Towns.=--In connection with this thriving trade and industry\\nthere grew up along the coast a number of prosperous commercial centers\\nwhich were soon reckoned among the first commercial towns of the whole\\nBritish empire, comparing favorably in numbers and wealth with such\\nports as Liverpool and Bristol. The statistical records of that time are\\nmainly guesses; but we know that Philadelphia stood first in size among\\nthese towns. Serving as the port of entry for Pennsylvania, Delaware,\\nand western Jersey, it had drawn within its borders, just before the\\nRevolution, about 25,000 inhabitants. Boston was second in rank, with\\nsomewhat more than 20,000 people. New York, the \"commercial capital of\\nConnecticut and old East Jersey,\" was slightly smaller than Boston, but\\ngrowing at a steady rate. The fourth town in size was Charleston, South\\nCarolina, with about 10,000 inhabitants. Newport in Rhode Island, a\\ncenter of rum manufacture and shipping, stood fifth, with a population\\nof about 7000. Baltimore and Norfolk were counted as \"considerable\\ntowns.\" In the interior, Hartford in Connecticut, Lancaster and York in\\nPennsylvania, and Albany in New York, with growing populations and\\nincreasing trade, gave prophecy of an urban America away from the\\nseaboard. The other towns were straggling villages. Williamsburg,\\nVirginia, for example, had about two hundred houses, in which dwelt a\\ndozen families of the gentry and a few score of tradesmen. Inland county\\nseats often consisted of nothing more than a log courthouse, a prison,\\nand one wretched inn to house judges, lawyers, and litigants during the\\nsessions of the court.\\n\\nThe leading towns exercised an influence on colonial opinion all out of\\nproportion to their population. They were the centers of wealth, for one\\nthing; of the press and political activity, for another. Merchants and\\nartisans could readily take concerted action on public questions arising\\nfrom their commercial operations. The towns were also centers for news,\\ngossip, religious controversy, and political discussion. In the market\\nplaces the farmers from the countryside learned of British policies and\\nlaws, and so, mingling with the townsmen, were drawn into the main\\ncurrents of opinion which set in toward colonial nationalism and\\nindependence.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nJ.

Few there were with time to read long\\nand widely, and fewer still who could devote their lives to things that\\ndelight the eye and the mind. And yet, poor and meager as the\\nintellectual life of the colonists may seem by way of comparison, heroic\\nefforts were made in every community to lift the people above the plane\\nof mere existence. After the first clearings were opened in the forests\\nthose efforts were redoubled, and with lengthening years told upon the\\nthought and spirit of the land. The appearance, during the struggle with\\nEngland, of an extraordinary group of leaders familiar with history,\\npolitical philosophy, and the arts of war, government, and diplomacy\\nitself bore eloquent testimony to the high quality of the American\\nintellect. No one, not even the most critical, can run through the\\nwritings of distinguished Americans scattered from Massachusetts to\\nGeorgia--the Adamses, Ellsworth, the Morrises, the Livingstons,\\nHamilton, Franklin, Washington, Madison, Marshall, Henry, the Randolphs,\\nand the Pinckneys--without coming to the conclusion that there was\\nsomething in American colonial life which fostered minds of depth and\\npower. Women surmounted even greater difficulties than the men in the\\nprocess of self-education, and their keen interest in public issues is\\nevident in many a record like the _Letters_ of Mrs. John Adams to her\\nhusband during the Revolution; the writings of Mrs. Mercy Otis Warren,\\nthe sister of James Otis, who measured her pen with the British\\npropagandists; and the patriot newspapers founded and managed by women.\\n\\n\\nTHE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCHES\\n\\nIn the intellectual life of America, the churches assumed a role of high\\nimportance. There were abundant reasons for this. In many of the\\ncolonies--Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New England--the religious impulse\\nhad been one of the impelling motives in stimulating immigration. In all\\nthe colonies, the clergy, at least in the beginning, formed the only\\nclass with any leisure to devote to matters of the spirit. They preached\\non Sundays and taught school on week days. They led in the discussion of\\nlocal problems and in the formation of political opinion, so much of\\nwhich was concerned with the relation between church and state. They\\nwrote books and pamphlets. They filled most of the chairs in the\\ncolleges; under clerical guidance, intellectual and spiritual, the\\nAmericans received their formal education. In several of the provinces\\nthe Anglican Church was established by law. In New England the Puritans\\nwere supreme, notwithstanding the efforts of the crown to overbear their\\nauthority. In the Middle colonies, particularly, the multiplication of\\nsects made the dominance of any single denomination impossible; and in\\nall of them there was a growing diversity of faith, which promised in\\ntime a separation of church and state and freedom of opinion.\\n\\n=The Church of England.=--Virginia was the stronghold of the English\\nsystem of church and state. The Anglican faith and worship were\\nprescribed by law, sustained by taxes imposed on all, and favored by the\\ngovernor, the provincial councilors, and the richest planters. \"The\\nEstablished Church,\" says Lodge, \"was one of the appendages of the\\nVirginia aristocracy. They controlled the vestries and the ministers,\\nand the parish church stood not infrequently on the estate of the\\nplanter who built and managed it.\" As in England, Catholics and\\nProtestant Dissenters were at first laid under heavy disabilities. Only\\nslowly and on sufferance were they admitted to the province; but when\\nonce they were even covertly tolerated, they pressed steadily in, until,\\nby the Revolution, they outnumbered the adherents of the established\\norder.\\n\\nThe Church was also sanctioned by law and supported by taxes in the\\nCarolinas after 1704, and in Georgia after that colony passed directly\\nunder the crown in 1754--this in spite of the fact that the majority of\\nthe inhabitants were Dissenters. Against the protests of the Catholics\\nit was likewise established in Maryland. In New York, too,\\nnotwithstanding the resistance of the Dutch, the Established Church was\\nfostered by the provincial officials, and the Anglicans, embracing about\\none-fifteenth of the population, exerted an influence all out of\\nproportion to their numbers.\\n\\nMany factors helped to enhance the power of the English Church in the\\ncolonies. It was supported by the British government and the official\\nclass sent out to the provinces. Its bishops and archbishops in England\\nwere appointed by the king, and its faith and service were set forth by\\nacts of Parliament. Having its seat of power in the English monarchy, it\\ncould hold its clergy and missionaries loyal to the crown and so\\ncounteract to some extent the independent spirit that was growing up in\\nAmerica. The Church, always a strong bulwark of the state, therefore had\\na political role to play here as in England. Able bishops and far-seeing\\nleaders firmly grasped this fact about the middle of the eighteenth\\ncentury and redoubled their efforts to augment the influence of the\\nChurch in provincial affairs. Unhappily for their plans they failed to\\ncalculate in advance the effect of their methods upon dissenting\\nProtestants, who still cherished memories of bitter religious conflicts\\nin the mother country.\\n\\n=Puritanism in New England.=--If the established faith made for imperial\\nunity, the same could not be said of Puritanism. The Plymouth Pilgrims\\nhad cast off all allegiance to the Anglican Church and established a\\nseparate and independent congregation before they came to America. The\\nPuritans, essaying at first the task of reformers within the Church,\\nsoon after their arrival in Massachusetts, likewise flung off their yoke\\nof union with the Anglicans. In each town a separate congregation was\\norganized, the male members choosing the pastor, the teachers, and the\\nother officers. They also composed the voters in the town meeting, where\\nsecular matters were determined. The union of church and government was\\nthus complete, and uniformity of faith and life prescribed by law and\\nenforced by civil authorities; but this worked for local autonomy\\ninstead of imperial unity.\\n\\nThe clergy became a powerful class, dominant through their learning and\\ntheir fearful denunciations of the faithless. They wrote the books for\\nthe people to read--the famous Cotton Mather having three hundred and\\neighty-three books and pamphlets to his credit. In cooperation with the\\ncivil officers they enforced a strict observance of the Puritan\\nSabbath--a day of rest that began at six o\\'clock on Saturday evening and\\nlasted until sunset on Sunday. All work, all trading, all amusement, and\\nall worldly conversation were absolutely prohibited during those hours.\\nA thoughtless maid servant who for some earthly reason smiled in church\\nwas in danger of being banished as a vagabond. Robert Pike, a devout\\nPuritan, thinking the sun had gone to rest, ventured forth on horseback\\none Sunday evening and was luckless enough to have a ray of light strike\\nhim through a rift in the clouds. The next day he was brought into court\\nand fined for \"his ungodly conduct.\" With persons accused of witchcraft\\nthe Puritans were still more ruthless. When a mania of persecution swept\\nover Massachusetts in 1692, eighteen people were hanged, one was pressed\\nto death, many suffered imprisonment, and two died in jail.\\n\\nJust about this time, however, there came a break in the uniformity of\\nPuritan rule. The crown and church in England had long looked upon it\\nwith disfavor, and in 1684 King Charles II annulled the old charter of\\nthe Massachusetts Bay Company. A new document issued seven years later\\nwrested from the Puritans of the colony the right to elect their own\\ngovernor and reserved the power of appointment to the king. It also\\nabolished the rule limiting the suffrage to church members, substituting\\nfor it a simple property qualification. Thus a royal governor and an\\nofficial family, certain to be Episcopalian in faith and monarchist in\\nsympathies, were forced upon Massachusetts; and members of all religious\\ndenominations, if they had the required amount of property, were\\npermitted to take part in elections. By this act in the name of the\\ncrown, the Puritan monopoly was broken down in Massachusetts, and that\\nprovince was brought into line with Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New\\nHampshire, where property, not religious faith, was the test for the\\nsuffrage.\\n\\n=Growth of Religious Toleration.=--Though neither the Anglicans of\\nVirginia nor the Puritans of Massachusetts believed in toleration for\\nother denominations, that principle was strictly applied in Rhode\\nIsland. There, under the leadership of Roger Williams, liberty in\\nmatters of conscience was established in the beginning. Maryland, by\\ngranting in 1649 freedom to those who professed to believe in Jesus\\nChrist, opened its gates to all Christians; and Pennsylvania, true to\\nthe tenets of the Friends, gave freedom of conscience to those \"who\\nconfess and acknowledge the one Almighty and Eternal God to be the\\ncreator, upholder, and ruler of the World.\" By one circumstance or\\nanother, the Middle colonies were thus early characterized by diversity\\nrather than uniformity of opinion. Dutch Protestants, Huguenots,\\nQuakers, Baptists, Presbyterians, New Lights, Moravians, Lutherans,\\nCatholics, and other denominations became too strongly intrenched and\\ntoo widely scattered to permit any one of them to rule, if it had\\ndesired to do so. There were communities and indeed whole sections where\\none or another church prevailed, but in no colony was a legislature\\nsteadily controlled by a single group. Toleration encouraged diversity,\\nand diversity, in turn, worked for greater toleration.\\n\\nThe government and faith of the dissenting denominations conspired with\\neconomic and political tendencies to draw America away from the English\\nstate. Presbyterians, Quakers, Baptists, and Puritans had no hierarchy\\nof bishops and archbishops to bind them to the seat of power in London.\\nNeither did they look to that metropolis for guidance in interpreting\\narticles of faith. Local self-government in matters ecclesiastical\\nhelped to train them for local self-government in matters political. The\\nspirit of independence which led Dissenters to revolt in the Old World,\\nnourished as it was amid favorable circumstances in the New World, made\\nthem all the more zealous in the defense of every right against\\nauthority imposed from without.\\n\\n\\nSCHOOLS AND COLLEGES\\n\\n=Religion and Local Schools.=--One of the first cares of each Protestant\\ndenomination was the education of the children in the faith. In this\\nwork the Bible became the center of interest. The English version was\\nindeed the one book of the people. Farmers, shopkeepers, and artisans,\\nwhose life had once been bounded by the daily routine of labor, found in\\nthe Scriptures not only an inspiration to religious conduct, but also a\\nbook of romance, travel, and history. \"Legend and annal,\" says John\\nRichard Green, \"war-song and psalm, state-roll and biography, the mighty\\nvoices of prophets, the parables of Evangelists, stories of mission\\njourneys, of perils by sea and among the heathen, philosophic arguments,\\napocalyptic visions, all were flung broadcast over minds unoccupied for\\nthe most part by any rival learning.... As a mere literary monument, the\\nEnglish version of the Bible remains the noblest example of the English\\ntongue.\" It was the King James version just from the press that the\\nPilgrims brought across the sea with them.\\n\\nFor the authority of the Established Church was substituted the\\nauthority of the Scriptures. The Puritans devised a catechism based upon\\ntheir interpretation of the Bible, and, very soon after their arrival in\\nAmerica, they ordered all parents and masters of servants to be diligent\\nin seeing that their children and wards were taught to read religious\\nworks and give answers to the religious questions. Massachusetts was\\nscarcely twenty years old before education of this character was\\ndeclared to be compulsory, and provision was made for public schools\\nwhere those not taught at home could receive instruction in reading and\\nwriting.\\n\\n[Illustration: A PAGE FROM A FAMOUS SCHOOLBOOK\\n\\n\\n     A In ADAM\\'S Fall\\n       We sinned all.\\n\\n     B Heaven to find,\\n       The Bible Mind.\\n\\n     C Christ crucify\\'d\\n       For sinners dy\\'d.\\n\\n     D The Deluge drown\\'d\\n       The Earth around.\\n\\n     E ELIJAH hid\\n       by Ravens fed.\\n\\n     F The judgment made\\n       FELIX afraid.]\\n\\n\\n\\nOutside of New England the idea of compulsory education was not regarded\\nwith the same favor; but the whole land was nevertheless dotted with\\nlittle schools kept by \"dames, itinerant teachers, or local parsons.\"\\nWhether we turn to the life of Franklin in the North or Washington in\\nthe South, we read of tiny schoolhouses, where boys, and sometimes\\ngirls, were taught to read and write. Where there were no schools,\\nfathers and mothers of the better kind gave their children the rudiments\\nof learning. Though illiteracy was widespread, there is evidence to show\\nthat the diffusion of knowledge among the masses was making steady\\nprogress all through the eighteenth century.\\n\\n=Religion and Higher Learning.=--Religious motives entered into the\\nestablishment of colleges as well as local schools. Harvard, founded in\\n1636, and Yale, opened in 1718, were intended primarily to train\\n\"learned and godly ministers\" for the Puritan churches of New England.\\nTo the far North, Dartmouth, chartered in 1769, was designed first as a\\nmission to the Indians and then as a college for the sons of New England\\nfarmers preparing to preach, teach, or practice law. The College of New\\nJersey, organized in 1746 and removed to Princeton eleven years later,\\nwas sustained by the Presbyterians. Two colleges looked to the\\nEstablished Church as their source of inspiration and support: William\\nand Mary, founded in Virginia in 1693, and King\\'s College, now Columbia\\nUniversity, chartered by King George II in 1754, on an appeal from the\\nNew York Anglicans, alarmed at the growth of religious dissent and the\\n\"republican tendencies\" of the age. Two colleges revealed a drift away\\nfrom sectarianism. Brown, established in Rhode Island in 1764, and the\\nPhiladelphia Academy, forerunner of the University of Pennsylvania,\\norganized by Benjamin Franklin, reflected the spirit of toleration by\\ngiving representation on the board of trustees to several religious\\nsects. It was Franklin\\'s idea that his college should prepare young men\\nto serve in public office as leaders of the people and ornaments to\\ntheir country.\\n\\n=Self-education in America.=--Important as were these institutions of\\nlearning, higher education was by no means confined within their walls.\\nMany well-to-do families sent their sons to Oxford or Cambridge in\\nEngland. Private tutoring in the home was common. In still more families\\nthere were intelligent children who grew up in the great colonial school\\nof adversity and who trained themselves until, in every contest of mind\\nand wit, they could vie with the sons of Harvard or William and Mary or\\nany other college. Such, for example, was Benjamin Franklin, whose\\ncharming autobiography, in addition to being an American classic, is a\\nfine record of self-education. His formal training in the classroom was\\nlimited to a few years at a local school in Boston; but his\\nself-education continued throughout his life. He early manifested a zeal\\nfor reading, and devoured, he tells us, his father\\'s dry library on\\ntheology, Bunyan\\'s works, Defoe\\'s writings, Plutarch\\'s _Lives_, Locke\\'s\\n_On the Human Understanding_, and innumerable volumes dealing with\\nsecular subjects. His literary style, perhaps the best of his time,\\nFranklin acquired by the diligent and repeated analysis of the\\n_Spectator_. In a life crowded with labors, he found time to read widely\\nin natural science and to win single-handed recognition at the hands of\\nEuropean savants for his discoveries in electricity. By his own efforts\\nhe \"attained an acquaintance\" with Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish,\\nthus unconsciously preparing himself for the day when he was to speak\\nfor all America at the court of the king of France.\\n\\nLesser lights than Franklin, educated by the same process, were found\\nall over colonial America. From this fruitful source of native ability,\\nself-educated, the American cause drew great strength in the trials of\\nthe Revolution.\\n\\n\\nTHE COLONIAL PRESS\\n\\n=The Rise of the Newspaper.=--The evolution of American democracy into a\\ngovernment by public opinion, enlightened by the open discussion of\\npolitical questions, was in no small measure aided by a free press. That\\ntoo, like education, was a matter of slow growth. A printing press was\\nbrought to Massachusetts in 1639, but it was put in charge of an\\nofficial censor and limited to the publication of religious works. Forty\\nyears elapsed before the first newspaper appeared, bearing the curious\\ntitle, _Public Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestic_, and it had not\\nbeen running very long before the government of Massachusetts suppressed\\nit for discussing a political question.\\n\\nPublishing, indeed, seemed to be a precarious business; but in 1704\\nthere came a second venture in journalism, _The Boston News-Letter_,\\nwhich proved to be a more lasting enterprise because it refrained from\\ncriticizing the authorities. Still the public interest languished. When\\nFranklin\\'s brother, James, began to issue his _New England Courant_\\nabout 1720, his friends sought to dissuade him, saying that one\\nnewspaper was enough for America. Nevertheless he continued it; and his\\nconfidence in the future was rewarded. In nearly every colony a gazette\\nor chronicle appeared within the next thirty years or more. Benjamin\\nFranklin was able to record in 1771 that America had twenty-five\\nnewspapers. Boston led with five. Philadelphia had three: two in English\\nand one in German.\\n\\n=Censorship and Restraints on the Press.=--The idea of printing,\\nunlicensed by the government and uncontrolled by the church, was,\\nhowever, slow in taking form. The founders of the American colonies had\\nnever known what it was to have the free and open publication of books,\\npamphlets, broadsides, and newspapers. When the art of printing was\\nfirst discovered, the control of publishing was vested in clerical\\nauthorities. After the establishment of the State Church in England in\\nthe reign of Elizabeth, censorship of the press became a part of royal\\nprerogative. Printing was restricted to Oxford, Cambridge, and London;\\nand no one could publish anything without previous approval of the\\nofficial censor. When the Puritans were in power, the popular party,\\nwith a zeal which rivaled that of the crown, sought, in turn, to silence\\nroyalist and clerical writers by a vigorous censorship. After the\\nrestoration of the monarchy, control of the press was once more placed\\nin royal hands, where it remained until 1695, when Parliament, by\\nfailing to renew the licensing act, did away entirely with the official\\n\\ncensorship. By that time political parties were so powerful and so\\nactive and printing presses were so numerous that official review of all\\npublished matter became a sheer impossibility.\\n\\nIn America, likewise, some troublesome questions arose in connection\\nwith freedom of the press. The Puritans of Massachusetts were no less\\nanxious than King Charles or the Archbishop of London to shut out from\\nthe prying eyes of the people all literature \"not mete for them to\\nread\"; and so they established a system of official licensing for\\npresses, which lasted until 1755. In the other colonies where there was\\nmore diversity of opinion and publishers could set up in business with\\nimpunity, they were nevertheless constantly liable to arrest for\\nprinting anything displeasing to the colonial governments. In 1721 the\\neditor of the _Mercury_ in Philadelphia was called before the\\nproprietary council and ordered to apologize for a political article,\\nand for a later offense of a similar character he was thrown into jail.\\nA still more famous case was that of Peter Zenger, a New York publisher,\\nwho was arrested in 1735 for criticising the administration. Lawyers who\\nventured to defend the unlucky editor were deprived of their licenses to\\npractice, and it became necessary to bring an attorney all the way from\\nPhiladelphia. By this time the tension of feeling was high, and the\\napprobation of the public was forthcoming when the lawyer for the\\ndefense exclaimed to the jury that the very cause of liberty itself, not\\nthat of the poor printer, was on trial! The verdict for Zenger, when it\\nfinally came, was the signal for an outburst of popular rejoicing.\\nAlready the people of King George\\'s province knew how precious a thing\\nis the freedom of the press.\\n\\nThanks to the schools, few and scattered as they were, and to the\\nvigilance of parents, a very large portion, perhaps nearly one-half, of\\nthe colonists could read. Through the newspapers, pamphlets, and\\nalmanacs that streamed from the types, the people could follow the\\ncourse of public events and grasp the significance of political\\narguments. An American opinion was in the process of making--an\\nindependent opinion nourished by the press and enriched by discussions\\naround the fireside and at the taverns. When the day of resistance to\\nBritish rule came, government by opinion was at hand. For every person\\nwho could hear the voice of Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams, there were a\\nthousand who could see their appeals on the printed page. Men who had\\nspelled out their letters while poring over Franklin\\'s _Poor Richard\\'s\\nAlmanac_ lived to read Thomas Paine\\'s thrilling call to arms.\\n\\n\\nTHE EVOLUTION IN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS\\n\\nTwo very distinct lines of development appeared in colonial politics.\\nThe one, exalting royal rights and aristocratic privileges, was the\\ndrift toward provincial government through royal officers appointed in\\nEngland. The other, leading toward democracy and self-government, was\\nthe growth in the power of the popular legislative assembly. Each\\nmovement gave impetus to the other, with increasing force during the\\npassing years, until at last the final collision between the two ideals\\nof government came in the war of independence.\\n\\n=The Royal Provinces.=--Of the thirteen English colonies eight were\\nroyal provinces in 1776, with governors appointed by the king. Virginia\\npassed under the direct rule of the crown in 1624, when the charter of\\nthe London Company was annulled. The Massachusetts Bay corporation lost\\nits charter in 1684, and the new instrument granted seven years later\\nstripped the colonists of the right to choose their chief executive. In\\nthe early decades of the eighteenth century both the Carolinas were\\ngiven the provincial instead of the proprietary form. New Hampshire,\\nsevered from Massachusetts in 1679, and Georgia, surrendered by the\\ntrustees in 1752, went into the hands of the crown. New York,\\ntransferred to the Duke of York on its capture from the Dutch in 1664,\\nbecame a province when he took the title of James II in 1685. New\\nJersey, after remaining for nearly forty years under proprietors, was\\nbrought directly under the king in 1702. Maryland, Pennsylvania, and\\nDelaware, although they retained their proprietary character until the\\nRevolution, were in some respects like the royal colonies, for their\\ngovernors were as independent of popular choice as were the appointees\\nof King George. Only two colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut,\\nretained full self-government on the eve of the Revolution. They alone\\nhad governors and legislatures entirely of their own choosing.\\n\\nThe chief officer of the royal province was the governor, who enjoyed\\nhigh and important powers which he naturally sought to augment at every\\nturn. He enforced the laws and, usually with the consent of a council,\\nappointed the civil and military officers. He granted pardons and\\nreprieves; he was head of the highest court; he was commander-in-chief\\nof the militia; he levied troops for defense and enforced martial law in\\ntime of invasion, war, and rebellion. In all the provinces, except\\nMassachusetts, he named the councilors who composed the upper house of\\nthe legislature and was likely to choose those who favored his claims.\\nHe summoned, adjourned, and dissolved the popular assembly, or the lower\\nhouse; he laid before it the projects of law desired by the crown; and\\nhe vetoed measures which he thought objectionable. Here were in America\\nall the elements of royal prerogative against which Hampden had\\nprotested and Cromwell had battled in England.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE ROYAL GOVERNOR\\'S PALACE AT NEW BERNE]\\n\\nThe colonial governors were generally surrounded by a body of\\noffice-seekers and hunters for land grants. Some of them were noblemen\\nof broken estates who had come to America to improve their fortunes. The\\npretensions of this circle grated on colonial nerves, and privileges\\ngranted to them, often at the expense of colonists, did much to deepen\\npopular antipathy to the British government. Favors extended to\\nadherents of the Established Church displeased Dissenters. The\\nreappearance of this formidable union of church and state, from which\\nthey had fled, stirred anew the ancient wrath against that combination.\\n\\n=The Colonial Assembly.=--Coincident with the drift toward\\nadministration through royal governors was the second and opposite\\ntendency, namely, a steady growth in the practice of self-government.\\nThe voters of England had long been accustomed to share in taxation and\\nlaw-making through representatives in Parliament, and the idea was early\\nintroduced in America. Virginia was only twelve years old (1619) when\\nits first representative assembly appeared. As the towns of\\nMassachusetts multiplied and it became impossible for all the members of\\nthe corporation to meet at one place, the representative idea was\\nadopted, in 1633. The river towns of Connecticut formed a representative\\nsystem under their \"Fundamental Orders\" of 1639, and the entire colony\\nwas given a royal charter in 1662. Generosity, as well as practical\\nconsiderations, induced such proprietors as Lord Baltimore and William\\nPenn to invite their colonists to share in the government as soon as any\\nconsiderable settlements were made. Thus by one process or another every\\none of the colonies secured a popular assembly.\\n\\nIt is true that in the provision for popular elections, the suffrage was\\nfinally restricted to property owners or taxpayers, with a leaning\\ntoward the freehold qualification. In Virginia, the rural voter had to\\nbe a freeholder owning at least fifty acres of land, if there was no\\nhouse on it, or twenty-five acres with a house twenty-five feet square.\\nIn Massachusetts, the voter for member of the assembly under the charter\\nof 1691 had to be a freeholder of an estate worth forty shillings a year\\nat least or of other property to the value of forty pounds sterling. In\\nPennsylvania, the suffrage was granted to freeholders owning fifty acres\\nor more of land well seated, twelve acres cleared, and to other persons\\nworth at least fifty pounds in lawful money.\\n\\nRestrictions like these undoubtedly excluded from the suffrage a very\\nconsiderable number of men, particularly the mechanics and artisans of\\nthe towns, who were by no means content with their position.\\nNevertheless, it was relatively easy for any man to acquire a small\\nfreehold, so cheap and abundant was land; and in fact a large proportion\\nof the colonists were land owners. Thus the assemblies, in spite of the\\nlimited suffrage, acquired a democratic tone.\\n\\nThe popular character of the assemblies increased as they became engaged\\nin battles with the royal and proprietary governors. When called upon by\\nthe executive to make provision for the support of the administration,\\nthe legislature took advantage of the opportunity to make terms in the\\ninterest of the taxpayers. It made annual, not permanent, grants of\\nmoney to pay official salaries and then insisted upon electing a\\ntreasurer to dole it out. Thus the colonists learned some of the\\nmysteries of public finance, as well as the management of rapacious\\nofficials. The legislature also used its power over money grants to\\nforce the governor to sign bills which he would otherwise have vetoed.\\n\\n=Contests between Legislatures and Governors.=--As may be imagined, many\\nand bitter were the contests between the royal and proprietary governors\\nand the colonial assemblies. Franklin relates an amusing story of how\\nthe Pennsylvania assembly held in one hand a bill for the executive to\\nsign and, in the other hand, the money to pay his salary. Then, with sly\\nhumor, Franklin adds: \"Do not, my courteous reader, take pet at our\\nproprietary constitution for these our bargain and sale proceedings in\\nlegislation. It is a happy country where justice and what was your own\\nbefore can be had for ready money. It is another addition to the value\\nof money and of course another spur to industry. Every land is not so\\nblessed.\"\\n\\nIt must not be thought, however, that every governor got off as easily\\nas Franklin\\'s tale implies. On the contrary, the legislatures, like\\nCaesar, fed upon meat that made them great and steadily encroached upon\\nexecutive prerogatives as they tried out and found their strength. If\\nwe may believe contemporary laments, the power of the crown in America\\nwas diminishing when it was struck down altogether. In New York, the\\nfriends of the governor complained in 1747 that \"the inhabitants of\\nplantations are generally educated in republican principles; upon\\nrepublican principles all is conducted. Little more than a shadow of\\nroyal authority remains in the Northern colonies.\" \"Here,\" echoed the\\ngovernor of South Carolina, the following year, \"levelling principles\\nprevail; the frame of the civil government is unhinged; a governor, if\\nhe would be idolized, must betray his trust; the people have got their\\nwhole administration in their hands; the election of the members of the\\nassembly is by ballot; not civil posts only, but all ecclesiastical\\npreferments, are in the disposal or election of the people.\"\\n\\nThough baffled by the \"levelling principles\" of the colonial assemblies,\\nthe governors did not give up the case as hopeless. Instead they evolved\\na system of policy and action which they thought could bring the\\nobstinate provincials to terms. That system, traceable in their letters\\nto the government in London, consisted of three parts: (1) the royal\\nofficers in the colonies were to be made independent of the legislatures\\nby taxes imposed by acts of Parliament; (2) a British standing army was\\nto be maintained in America; (3) the remaining colonial charters were to\\nbe revoked and government by direct royal authority was to be enlarged.\\n\\nSuch a system seemed plausible enough to King George III and to many\\nministers of the crown in London. With governors, courts, and an army\\nindependent of the colonists, they imagined it would be easy to carry\\nout both royal orders and acts of Parliament. This reasoning seemed both\\npractical and logical. Nor was it founded on theory, for it came fresh\\nfrom the governors themselves. It was wanting in one respect only. It\\nfailed to take account of the fact that the American people were growing\\nstrong in the practice of self-government and could dispense with the\\ntutelage of the British ministry, no matter how excellent it might be or\\nhow benevolent its intentions.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nA.M.

The imperative call to common\\ndefense, the habit of sharing common burdens, the fusing force of common\\nservice--these things, induced by the necessity of resisting outside\\ninterference, act as an amalgam drawing together all elements, except,\\nperhaps, the most discordant. The presence of the enemy allays the most\\nvirulent of quarrels, temporarily at least. \"Politics,\" runs an old\\nsaying, \"stops at the water\\'s edge.\"\\n\\nThis ancient political principle, so well understood in diplomatic\\ncircles, applied nearly as well to the original thirteen American\\ncolonies as to the countries of Europe. The necessity for common\\ndefense, if not equally great, was certainly always pressing. Though it\\nhas long been the practice to speak of the early settlements as founded\\nin \"a wilderness,\" this was not actually the case. From the earliest\\ndays of Jamestown on through the years, the American people were\\nconfronted by dangers from without. All about their tiny settlements\\nwere Indians, growing more and more hostile as the frontier advanced and\\nas sharp conflicts over land aroused angry passions. To the south and\\nwest was the power of Spain, humiliated, it is true, by the disaster to\\nthe Armada, but still presenting an imposing front to the British\\nempire. To the north and west were the French, ambitious, energetic,\\nimperial in temper, and prepared to contest on land and water the\\nadvance of British dominion in America.\\n\\n\\nRELATIONS WITH THE INDIANS AND THE FRENCH\\n\\n=Indian Affairs.=--It is difficult to make general statements about the\\nrelations of the colonists to the Indians. The problem was presented in\\ndifferent shape in different sections of America. It was not handled\\naccording to any coherent or uniform plan by the British government,\\nwhich alone could speak for all the provinces at the same time. Neither\\ndid the proprietors and the governors who succeeded one another, in an\\nirregular train, have the consistent policy or the matured experience\\nnecessary for dealing wisely with Indian matters. As the difficulties\\narose mainly on the frontiers, where the restless and pushing pioneers\\nwere making their way with gun and ax, nearly everything that happened\\nwas the result of chance rather than of calculation. A personal quarrel\\nbetween traders and an Indian, a jug of whisky, a keg of gunpowder, the\\nexchange of guns for furs, personal treachery, or a flash of bad temper\\noften set in motion destructive forces of the most terrible character.\\n\\nOn one side of the ledger may be set innumerable generous records--of\\nSquanto and Samoset teaching the Pilgrims the ways of the wilds; of\\nRoger Williams buying his lands from the friendly natives; or of William\\nPenn treating with them on his arrival in America. On the other side of\\nthe ledger must be recorded many a cruel and bloody conflict as the\\nfrontier rolled westward with deadly precision. The Pequots on the\\nConnecticut border, sensing their doom, fell upon the tiny settlements\\nwith awful fury in 1637 only to meet with equally terrible punishment. A\\ngeneration later, King Philip, son of Massasoit, the friend of the\\nPilgrims, called his tribesmen to a war of extermination which brought\\nthe strength of all New England to the field and ended in his own\\ndestruction. In New York, the relations with the Indians, especially\\nwith the Algonquins and the Mohawks, were marked by periodic and\\ndesperate wars. Virginia and her Southern neighbors suffered as did New\\nEngland. In 1622 Opecacano, a brother of Powhatan, the friend of the\\nJamestown settlers, launched a general massacre; and in 1644 he\\nattempted a war of extermination. In 1675 the whole frontier was ablaze.\\nNathaniel Bacon vainly attempted to stir the colonial governor to put up\\nan adequate defense and, failing in that plea, himself headed a revolt\\nand a successful expedition against the Indians. As the Virginia\\noutposts advanced into the Kentucky country, the strife with the natives\\nwas transferred to that \"dark and bloody ground\"; while to the\\nsoutheast, a desperate struggle with the Tuscaroras called forth the\\ncombined forces of the two Carolinas and Virginia.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print._\\n\\nVIRGINIANS DEFENDING THEMSELVES AGAINST THE INDIANS]\\n\\nFrom such horrors New Jersey and Delaware were saved on account of their\\ngeographical location. Pennsylvania, consistently following a policy of\\nconciliation, was likewise spared until her western vanguard came into\\nfull conflict with the allied French and Indians. Georgia, by clever\\nnegotiations and treaties of alliance, managed to keep on fair terms\\nwith her belligerent Cherokees and Creeks. But neither diplomacy nor\\ngenerosity could stay the inevitable conflict as the frontier advanced,\\nespecially after the French soldiers enlisted the Indians in their\\nimperial enterprises. It was then that desultory fighting became general\\nwarfare.\\n\\n[Illustration: ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND SPANISH POSSESSIONS IN AMERICA,\\n1750]\\n\\n=Early Relations with the French.=--During the first decades of French\\nexploration and settlement in the St. Lawrence country, the English\\ncolonies, engrossed with their own problems, gave little or no thought\\nto their distant neighbors. Quebec, founded in 1608, and Montreal, in\\n1642, were too far away, too small in population, and too slight in\\nstrength to be much of a menace to Boston, Hartford, or New York. It was\\nthe statesmen in France and England, rather than the colonists in\\nAmerica, who first grasped the significance of the slowly converging\\nempires in North America. It was the ambition of Louis XIV of France,\\nrather than the labors of Jesuit missionaries and French rangers, that\\nsounded the first note of colonial alarm.\\n\\nEvidence of this lies in the fact that three conflicts between the\\nEnglish and the French occurred before their advancing frontiers met on\\nthe Pennsylvania border. King William\\'s War (1689-1697), Queen Anne\\'s\\nWar (1701-1713), and King George\\'s War (1744-1748) owed their origins\\nand their endings mainly to the intrigues and rivalries of European\\npowers, although they all involved the American colonies in struggles\\nwith the French and their savage allies.\\n\\n=The Clash in the Ohio Valley.=--The second of these wars had hardly\\nclosed, however, before the English colonists themselves began to be\\nseriously alarmed about the rapidly expanding French dominion in the\\nWest. Marquette and Joliet, who opened the Lake region, and La Salle,\\nwho in 1682 had gone down the Mississippi to the Gulf, had been followed\\nby the builders of forts. In 1718, the French founded New Orleans, thus\\ntaking possession of the gateway to the Mississippi as well as the St.\\nLawrence. A few years later they built Fort Niagara; in 1731 they\\noccupied Crown Point; in 1749 they formally announced their dominion\\nover all the territory drained by the Ohio River. Having asserted this\\nlofty claim, they set out to make it good by constructing in the years\\n1752-1754 Fort Le Boeuf near Lake Erie, Fort Venango on the upper\\nwaters of the Allegheny, and Fort Duquesne at the junction of the\\nstreams forming the Ohio. Though they were warned by George Washington,\\nin the name of the governor of Virginia, to keep out of territory \"so\\nnotoriously known to be property of the crown of Great Britain,\" the\\nFrench showed no signs of relinquishing their pretensions.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n\\nBRADDOCK\\'S RETREAT]\\n\\n=The Final Phase--the French and Indian War.=--Thus it happened that the\\nshot which opened the Seven Years\\' War, known in America as the French\\nand Indian War, was fired in the wilds of Pennsylvania. There began the\\nconflict that spread to Europe and even Asia and finally involved\\nEngland and Prussia, on the one side, and France, Austria, Spain, and\\nminor powers on the other. On American soil, the defeat of Braddock in\\n1755 and Wolfe\\'s exploit in capturing Quebec four years later were the\\ndramatic features. On the continent of Europe, England subsidized\\nPrussian arms to hold France at bay. In India, on the banks of the\\nGanges, as on the banks of the St. Lawrence, British arms were\\ntriumphant. Well could the historian write: \"Conquests equaling in\\nrapidity and far surpassing in magnitude those of Cortes and Pizarro had\\nbeen achieved in the East.\" Well could the merchants of London declare\\nthat under the administration of William Pitt, the imperial genius of\\nthis world-wide conflict, commerce had been \"united with and made to\\nflourish by war.\"\\n\\nFrom the point of view of the British empire, the results of the war\\nwere momentous. By the peace of 1763, Canada and the territory east of\\nthe Mississippi, except New Orleans, passed under the British flag. The\\nremainder of the Louisiana territory was transferred to Spain and French\\nimperial ambitions on the American continent were laid to rest. In\\nexchange for Havana, which the British had seized during the war, Spain\\nceded to King George the colony of Florida. Not without warrant did\\nMacaulay write in after years that Pitt \"was the first Englishman of his\\ntime; and he had made England the first country in the world.\"\\n\\n\\nTHE EFFECTS OF WARFARE ON THE COLONIES\\n\\nThe various wars with the French and the Indians, trivial in detail as\\nthey seem to-day, had a profound influence on colonial life and on the\\ndestiny of America. Circumstances beyond the control of popular\\nassemblies, jealous of their individual powers, compelled cooperation\\namong them, grudging and stingy no doubt, but still cooperation. The\\nAmerican people, more eager to be busy in their fields or at their\\ntrades, were simply forced to raise and support armies, to learn the\\narts of warfare, and to practice, if in a small theater, the science of\\nstatecraft. These forces, all cumulative, drove the colonists, so\\ntenaciously provincial in their habits, in the direction of nationalism.\\n\\n=The New England Confederation.=--It was in their efforts to deal with\\nthe problems presented by the Indian and French menace that the\\nAmericans took the first steps toward union. Though there were many\\ncommon ties among the settlers of New England, it required a deadly\\nfear of the Indians to produce in 1643 the New England Confederation,\\ncomposed of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven. The\\ncolonies so united were bound together in \"a firm and perpetual league\\nof friendship and amity for offense and defense, mutual service and\\nsuccor, upon all just occasions.\" They made provision for distributing\\nthe burdens of wars among the members and provided for a congress of\\ncommissioners from each colony to determine upon common policies. For\\nsome twenty years the Confederation was active and it continued to hold\\nmeetings until after the extinction of the Indian peril on the immediate\\nborder.\\n\\nVirginia, no less than Massachusetts, was aware of the importance of\\nintercolonial cooperation. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the\\nOld Dominion began treaties of commerce and amity with New York and the\\ncolonies of New England. In 1684 delegates from Virginia met at Albany\\nwith the agents of New York and Massachusetts to discuss problems of\\nmutual defense. A few years later the Old Dominion cooperated loyally\\nwith the Carolinas in defending their borders against Indian forays.\\n\\n=The Albany Plan of Union.=--An attempt at a general colonial union was\\nmade in 1754. On the suggestion of the Lords of Trade in England, a\\nconference was held at Albany to consider Indian relations, to devise\\nmeasures of defense against the French, and to enter into \"articles of\\nunion and confederation for the general defense of his Majesty\\'s\\nsubjects and interests in North America as well in time of peace as of\\nwar.\" New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York,\\nPennsylvania, and Maryland were represented. After a long discussion, a\\nplan of union, drafted mainly, it seems, by Benjamin Franklin, was\\nadopted and sent to the colonies and the crown for approval. The\\ncolonies, jealous of their individual rights, refused to accept the\\nscheme and the king disapproved it for the reason, Franklin said, that\\nit had \"too much weight in the democratic part of the constitution.\"\\nThough the Albany union failed, the document is still worthy of study\\nbecause it forecast many of the perplexing problems that were not solved\\nuntil thirty-three years afterward, when another convention of which\\nalso Franklin was a member drafted the Constitution of the United\\nStates.\\n\\n[Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN]\\n\\n=The Military Education of the Colonists.=--The same wars that showed\\nthe provincials the meaning of union likewise instructed them in the art\\nof defending their institutions. Particularly was this true of the last\\nFrench and Indian conflict, which stretched all the way from Maine to\\nthe Carolinas and made heavy calls upon them all for troops. The answer,\\nit is admitted, was far from satisfactory to the British government and\\nthe conduct of the militiamen was far from professional; but thousands\\nof Americans got a taste, a strong taste, of actual fighting in the\\nfield. Men like George Washington and Daniel Morgan learned lessons that\\nwere not forgotten in after years. They saw what American militiamen\\ncould do under favorable circumstances and they watched British regulars\\noperating on American soil. \"This whole transaction,\" shrewdly remarked\\nFranklin of Braddock\\'s campaign, \"gave us Americans the first suspicion\\nthat our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regular troops had not\\nbeen well founded.\" It was no mere accident that the Virginia colonel\\nwho drew his sword under the elm at Cambridge and took command of the\\narmy of the Revolution was the brave officer who had \"spurned the\\nwhistle of bullets\" at the memorable battle in western Pennsylvania.\\n\\n=Financial Burdens and Commercial Disorder.=--While the provincials were\\nlearning lessons in warfare they were also paying the bills. All the\\nconflicts were costly in treasure as in blood. King Philip\\'s war left\\nNew England weak and almost bankrupt. The French and Indian struggle was\\nespecially expensive. The twenty-five thousand men put in the field by\\nthe colonies were sustained only by huge outlays of money. Paper\\ncurrency streamed from the press and debts were accumulated. Commerce\\nwas driven from its usual channels and prices were enhanced. When the\\nend came, both England and America were staggering under heavy\\nliabilities, and to make matters worse there was a fall of prices\\naccompanied by a commercial depression which extended over a period of\\nten years. It was in the midst of this crisis that measures of taxation\\nhad to be devised to pay the cost of the war, precipitating the quarrel\\nwhich led to American independence.\\n\\n=The Expulsion of French Power from North America.=--The effects of the\\ndefeat administered to France, as time proved, were difficult to\\nestimate. Some British statesmen regarded it as a happy circumstance\\nthat the colonists, already restive under their administration, had no\\nforeign power at hand to aid them in case they struck for independence.\\nAmerican leaders, on the other hand, now that the soldiers of King Louis\\nwere driven from the continent, thought that they had no other country\\nto fear if they cast off British sovereignty. At all events, France,\\nthough defeated, was not out of the sphere of American influence; for,\\nas events proved, it was the fortunate French alliance negotiated by\\nFranklin that assured the triumph of American arms in the War of the\\nRevolution.\\n\\n\\nCOLONIAL RELATIONS WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT\\n\\nIt was neither the Indian wars nor the French wars that finally brought\\nforth American nationality. That was the product of the long strife\\nwith the mother country which culminated in union for the war of\\nindependence. The forces that created this nation did not operate in the\\ncolonies alone. The character of the English sovereigns, the course of\\nevents in English domestic politics, and English measures of control\\nover the colonies--executive, legislative, and judicial--must all be\\ntaken into account.\\n\\n=The Last of the Stuarts.=--The struggles between Charles I (1625-49)\\nand the parliamentary party and the turmoil of the Puritan regime\\n(1649-60) so engrossed the attention of Englishmen at home that they had\\nlittle time to think of colonial policies or to interfere with colonial\\naffairs. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660, accompanied by\\ninternal peace and the increasing power of the mercantile classes in the\\nHouse of Commons, changed all that. In the reign of Charles II\\n(1660-85), himself an easy-going person, the policy of regulating trade\\nby act of Parliament was developed into a closely knit system and\\npowerful agencies to supervise the colonies were created. At the same\\ntime a system of stricter control over the dominions was ushered in by\\nthe annulment of the old charter of Massachusetts which conferred so\\nmuch self-government on the Puritans.\\n\\nCharles\\' successor, James II, a man of sterner stuff and jealous of his\\nauthority in the colonies as well as at home, continued the policy thus\\ninaugurated and enlarged upon it. If he could have kept his throne, he\\nwould have bent the Americans under a harsh rule or brought on in his\\ndominions a revolution like that which he precipitated at home in 1688.\\nHe determined to unite the Northern colonies and introduce a more\\nefficient administration based on the pattern of the royal provinces. He\\nmade a martinet, Sir Edmund Andros, governor of all New England, New\\nYork, and New Jersey. The charter of Massachusetts, annulled in the last\\ndays of his brother\\'s reign, he continued to ignore, and that of\\nConnecticut would have been seized if it had not been spirited away and\\nhidden, according to tradition, in a hollow oak.\\n\\nFor several months, Andros gave the Northern colonies a taste of\\nill-tempered despotism. He wrung quit rents from land owners not\\naccustomed to feudal dues; he abrogated titles to land where, in his\\nopinion, they were unlawful; he forced the Episcopal service upon the\\nOld South Church in Boston; and he denied the writ of _habeas corpus_ to\\na preacher who denounced taxation without representation. In the middle\\nof his arbitrary course, however, his hand was stayed. The news came\\nthat King James had been dethroned by his angry subjects, and the people\\nof Boston, kindling a fire on Beacon Hill, summoned the countryside to\\ndispose of Andros. The response was prompt and hearty. The hated\\ngovernor was arrested, imprisoned, and sent back across the sea under\\nguard.\\n\\nThe overthrow of James, followed by the accession of William and Mary\\nand by assured parliamentary supremacy, had an immediate effect in the\\ncolonies. The new order was greeted with thanksgiving. Massachusetts was\\ngiven another charter which, though not so liberal as the first,\\nrestored the spirit if not the entire letter of self-government. In the\\nother colonies where Andros had been operating, the old course of\\naffairs was resumed.\\n\\n=The Indifference of the First Two Georges.=--On the death in 1714 of\\nQueen Anne, the successor of King William, the throne passed to a\\nHanoverian prince who, though grateful for English honors and revenues,\\nwas more interested in Hanover than in England. George I and George II,\\nwhose combined reigns extended from 1714 to 1760, never even learned to\\nspeak the English language, at least without an accent. The necessity of\\ntaking thought about colonial affairs bored both of them so that the\\nstoutest defender of popular privileges in Boston or Charleston had no\\nground to complain of the exercise of personal prerogatives by the king.\\nMoreover, during a large part of this period, the direction of affairs\\nwas in the hands of an astute leader, Sir Robert Walpole, who betrayed\\nhis somewhat cynical view of politics by adopting as his motto: \"Let\\nsleeping dogs lie.\" He revealed his appreciation of popular sentiment\\nby exclaiming: \"I will not be the minister to enforce taxes at the\\nexpense of blood.\" Such kings and such ministers were not likely to\\narouse the slumbering resistance of the thirteen colonies across the\\nsea.\\n\\n=Control of the Crown over the Colonies.=--While no English ruler from\\nJames II to George III ventured to interfere with colonial matters\\npersonally, constant control over the colonies was exercised by royal\\nofficers acting under the authority of the crown. Systematic supervision\\nbegan in 1660, when there was created by royal order a committee of the\\nking\\'s council to meet on Mondays and Thursdays of each week to consider\\npetitions, memorials, and addresses respecting the plantations. In 1696\\na regular board was established, known as the \"Lords of Trade and\\nPlantations,\" which continued, until the American Revolution, to\\nscrutinize closely colonial business. The chief duties of the board were\\nto examine acts of colonial legislatures, to recommend measures to those\\nassemblies for adoption, and to hear memorials and petitions from the\\ncolonies relative to their affairs.\\n\\nThe methods employed by this board were varied. All laws passed by\\nAmerican legislatures came before it for review as a matter of routine.\\nIf it found an act unsatisfactory, it recommended to the king the\\nexercise of his veto power, known as the royal disallowance. Any person\\nwho believed his personal or property rights injured by a colonial law\\ncould be heard by the board in person or by attorney; in such cases it\\nwas the practice to hear at the same time the agent of the colony so\\ninvolved. The royal veto power over colonial legislation was not,\\ntherefore, a formal affair, but was constantly employed on the\\nsuggestion of a highly efficient agency of the crown. All this was in\\naddition to the powers exercised by the governors in the royal\\nprovinces.\\n\\n=Judicial Control.=--Supplementing this administrative control over the\\ncolonies was a constant supervision by the English courts of law. The\\nking, by virtue of his inherent authority, claimed and exercised high\\nappellate powers over all judicial tribunals in the empire. The right\\nof appeal from local courts, expressly set forth in some charters, was,\\non the eve of the Revolution, maintained in every colony. Any subject in\\nEngland or America, who, in the regular legal course, was aggrieved by\\nany act of a colonial legislature or any decision of a colonial court,\\nhad the right, subject to certain regulations, to carry his case to the\\nking in council, forcing his opponent to follow him across the sea. In\\nthe exercise of appellate power, the king in council acting as a court\\ncould, and frequently did, declare acts of colonial legislatures duly\\nenacted and approved, null and void, on the ground that they were\\ncontrary to English law.\\n\\n=Imperial Control in Operation.=--Day after day, week after week, year\\nafter year, the machinery for political and judicial control over\\ncolonial affairs was in operation. At one time the British governors in\\nthe colonies were ordered not to approve any colonial law imposing a\\nduty on European goods imported in English vessels. Again, when North\\nCarolina laid a tax on peddlers, the council objected to it as\\n\"restrictive upon the trade and dispersion of English manufactures\\nthroughout the continent.\" At other times, Indian trade was regulated in\\nthe interests of the whole empire or grants of lands by a colonial\\nlegislature were set aside. Virginia was forbidden to close her ports to\\nNorth Carolina lest there should be retaliation.\\n\\nIn short, foreign and intercolonial trade were subjected to a control\\nhigher than that of the colony, foreshadowing a day when the\\nConstitution of the United States was to commit to Congress the power to\\nregulate interstate and foreign commerce and commerce with the Indians.\\nA superior judicial power, towering above that of the colonies, as the\\nSupreme Court at Washington now towers above the states, kept the\\ncolonial legislatures within the metes and bounds of established law. In\\nthe thousands of appeals, memorials, petitions, and complaints, and the\\nrulings and decisions upon them, were written the real history of\\nBritish imperial control over the American colonies.\\n\\nSo great was the business before the Lords of Trade that the colonies\\nhad to keep skilled agents in London to protect their interests. As\\ncommon grievances against the operation of this machinery of control\\narose, there appeared in each colony a considerable body of men, with\\nthe merchants in the lead, who chafed at the restraints imposed on their\\nenterprise. Only a powerful blow was needed to weld these bodies into a\\ncommon mass nourishing the spirit of colonial nationalism. When to the\\nrepeated minor irritations were added general and sweeping measures of\\nParliament applying to every colony, the rebound came in the Revolution.\\n\\n=Parliamentary Control over Colonial Affairs.=--As soon as Parliament\\ngained in power at the expense of the king, it reached out to bring the\\nAmerican colonies under its sway as well. Between the execution of\\nCharles I and the accession of George III, there was enacted an immense\\nbody of legislation regulating the shipping, trade, and manufactures of\\nAmerica. All of it, based on the \"mercantile\" theory then prevalent in\\nall countries of Europe, was designed to control the overseas\\nplantations in such a way as to foster the commercial and business\\ninterests of the mother country, where merchants and men of finance had\\ngot the upper hand. According to this theory, the colonies of the\\nBritish empire should be confined to agriculture and the production of\\nraw materials, and forced to buy their manufactured goods of England.\\n\\n_The Navigation Acts._--In the first rank among these measures of\\nBritish colonial policy must be placed the navigation laws framed for\\nthe purpose of building up the British merchant marine and navy--arms so\\nessential in defending the colonies against the Spanish, Dutch, and\\nFrench. The beginning of this type of legislation was made in 1651 and\\nit was worked out into a system early in the reign of Charles II\\n(1660-85).\\n\\nThe Navigation Acts, in effect, gave a monopoly of colonial commerce to\\nBritish ships. No trade could be carried on between Great Britain and\\nher dominions save in vessels built and manned by British subjects. No\\nEuropean goods could be brought to America save in the ships of the\\ncountry that produced them or in English ships. These laws, which were\\nalmost fatal to Dutch shipping in America, fell with severity upon the\\ncolonists, compelling them to pay higher freight rates. The adverse\\neffect, however, was short-lived, for the measures stimulated\\nshipbuilding in the colonies, where the abundance of raw materials gave\\nthe master builders of America an advantage over those of the mother\\ncountry. Thus the colonists in the end profited from the restrictive\\npolicy written into the Navigation Acts.\\n\\n_The Acts against Manufactures._--The second group of laws was\\ndeliberately aimed to prevent colonial industries from competing too\\nsharply with those of England. Among the earliest of these measures may\\nbe counted the Woolen Act of 1699, forbidding the exportation of woolen\\ngoods from the colonies and even the woolen trade between towns and\\ncolonies. When Parliament learned, as the result of an inquiry, that New\\nEngland and New York were making thousands of hats a year and sending\\nlarge numbers annually to the Southern colonies and to Ireland, Spain,\\nand Portugal, it enacted in 1732 a law declaring that \"no hats or felts,\\ndyed or undyed, finished or unfinished\" should be \"put upon any vessel\\nor laden upon any horse or cart with intent to export to any place\\nwhatever.\" The effect of this measure upon the hat industry was almost\\nruinous. A few years later a similar blow was given to the iron\\nindustry. By an act of 1750, pig and bar iron from the colonies were\\ngiven free entry to England to encourage the production of the raw\\nmaterial; but at the same time the law provided that \"no mill or other\\nengine for slitting or rolling of iron, no plating forge to work with a\\ntilt hammer, and no furnace for making steel\" should be built in the\\ncolonies. As for those already built, they were declared public\\nnuisances and ordered closed. Thus three important economic interests of\\nthe colonists, the woolen, hat, and iron industries, were laid under the\\nban.\\n\\n_The Trade Laws._--The third group of restrictive measures passed by the\\nBritish Parliament related to the sale of colonial produce. An act of\\n1663 required the colonies to export certain articles to Great Britain\\nor to her dominions alone; while sugar, tobacco, and ginger consigned to\\nthe continent of Europe had to pass through a British port paying custom\\nduties and through a British merchant\\'s hands paying the usual\\ncommission. At first tobacco was the only one of the \"enumerated\\narticles\" which seriously concerned the American colonies, the rest\\ncoming mainly from the British West Indies. In the course of time,\\nhowever, other commodities were added to the list of enumerated\\narticles, until by 1764 it embraced rice, naval stores, copper, furs,\\nhides, iron, lumber, and pearl ashes. This was not all. The colonies\\nwere compelled to bring their European purchases back through English\\nports, paying duties to the government and commissions to merchants\\nagain.\\n\\n_The Molasses Act._--Not content with laws enacted in the interest of\\nEnglish merchants and manufacturers, Parliament sought to protect the\\nBritish West Indies against competition from their French and Dutch\\nneighbors. New England merchants had long carried on a lucrative trade\\nwith the French islands in the West Indies and Dutch Guiana, where sugar\\nand molasses could be obtained in large quantities at low prices. Acting\\non the protests of English planters in the Barbadoes and Jamaica,\\nParliament, in 1733, passed the famous Molasses Act imposing duties on\\nsugar and molasses imported into the colonies from foreign\\ncountries--rates which would have destroyed the American trade with the\\nFrench and Dutch if the law had been enforced. The duties, however, were\\nnot collected. The molasses and sugar trade with the foreigners went on\\nmerrily, smuggling taking the place of lawful traffic.\\n\\n=Effect of the Laws in America.=--As compared with the strict monopoly\\nof her colonial trade which Spain consistently sought to maintain, the\\npolicy of England was both moderate and liberal. Furthermore, the\\nrestrictive laws were supplemented by many measures intended to be\\nfavorable to colonial prosperity. The Navigation Acts, for example,\\nredounded to the advantage of American shipbuilders and the producers\\nof hemp, tar, lumber, and ship stores in general. Favors in British\\nports were granted to colonial producers as against foreign competitors\\nand in some instances bounties were paid by England to encourage\\ncolonial enterprise. Taken all in all, there is much justification in\\nthe argument advanced by some modern scholars to the effect that the\\ncolonists gained more than they lost by British trade and industrial\\nlegislation. Certainly after the establishment of independence, when\\nfree from these old restrictions, the Americans found themselves\\nhandicapped by being treated as foreigners rather than favored traders\\nand the recipients of bounties in English markets.\\n\\nBe that as it may, it appears that the colonists felt little irritation\\nagainst the mother country on account of the trade and navigation laws\\nenacted previous to the close of the French and Indian war. Relatively\\nfew were engaged in the hat and iron industries as compared with those\\nin farming and planting, so that England\\'s policy of restricting America\\nto agriculture did not conflict with the interests of the majority of\\nthe inhabitants. The woolen industry was largely in the hands of women\\nand carried on in connection with their domestic duties, so that it was\\nnot the sole support of any considerable number of people.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, moreover, the restrictive laws, especially those\\nrelating to trade, were not rigidly enforced. Cargoes of tobacco were\\nboldly sent to continental ports without even so much as a bow to the\\nEnglish government, to which duties should have been paid. Sugar and\\nmolasses from the French and Dutch colonies were shipped into New\\nEngland in spite of the law. Royal officers sometimes protested against\\nsmuggling and sometimes connived at it; but at no time did they succeed\\nin stopping it. Taken all in all, very little was heard of \"the galling\\nrestraints of trade\" until after the French war, when the British\\ngovernment suddenly entered upon a new course.\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD\\n\\nIn the period between the landing of the English at Jamestown, Virginia,\\nin 1607, and the close of the French and Indian war in 1763--a period of\\na century and a half--a new nation was being prepared on this continent\\nto take its place among the powers of the earth. It was an epoch of\\nmigration. Western Europe contributed emigrants of many races and\\nnationalities. The English led the way. Next to them in numerical\\nimportance were the Scotch-Irish and the Germans. Into the melting pot\\nwere also cast Dutch, Swedes, French, Jews, Welsh, and Irish. Thousands\\nof negroes were brought from Africa to till Southern fields or labor as\\ndomestic servants in the North.\\n\\nWhy did they come? The reasons are various. Some of them, the Pilgrims\\nand Puritans of New England, the French Huguenots, Scotch-Irish and\\nIrish, and the Catholics of Maryland, fled from intolerant governments\\nthat denied them the right to worship God according to the dictates of\\ntheir consciences. Thousands came to escape the bondage of poverty in\\nthe Old World and to find free homes in America. Thousands, like the\\nnegroes from Africa, were dragged here against their will. The lure of\\nadventure appealed to the restless and the lure of profits to the\\nenterprising merchants.\\n\\nHow did they come? In some cases religious brotherhoods banded together\\nand borrowed or furnished the funds necessary to pay the way. In other\\ncases great trading companies were organized to found colonies. Again it\\nwas the wealthy proprietor, like Lord Baltimore or William Penn, who\\nundertook to plant settlements. Many immigrants were able to pay their\\nown way across the sea. Others bound themselves out for a term of years\\nin exchange for the cost of the passage. Negroes were brought on account\\nof the profits derived from their sale as slaves.\\n\\nWhatever the motive for their coming, however, they managed to get\\nacross the sea. The immigrants set to work with a will. They cut down\\nforests, built houses, and laid out fields. They founded churches,\\nschools, and colleges. They set up forges and workshops. They spun and\\nwove. They fashioned ships and sailed the seas. They bartered and\\ntraded. Here and there on favorable harbors they established centers of\\ncommerce--Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and\\nCharleston. As soon as a firm foothold was secured on the shore line\\nthey pressed westward until, by the close of the colonial period, they\\nwere already on the crest of the Alleghanies.\\n\\nThough they were widely scattered along a thousand miles of seacoast,\\nthe colonists were united in spirit by many common ties. The major\\nportion of them were Protestants. The language, the law, and the\\nliterature of England furnished the basis of national unity. Most of the\\ncolonists were engaged in the same hard task; that of conquering a\\nwilderness. To ties of kinship and language were added ties created by\\nnecessity. They had to unite in defense; first, against the Indians and\\nlater against the French. They were all subjects of the same\\nsovereign--the king of England. The English Parliament made laws for\\nthem and the English government supervised their local affairs, their\\ntrade, and their manufactures. Common forces assailed them. Common\\ngrievances vexed them. Common hopes inspired them.\\n\\nMany of the things which tended to unite them likewise tended to throw\\nthem into opposition to the British Crown and Parliament. Most of them\\nwere freeholders; that is, farmers who owned their own land and tilled\\nit with their own hands. A free soil nourished the spirit of freedom.\\nThe majority of them were Dissenters, critics, not friends, of the\\nChurch of England, that stanch defender of the British monarchy. Each\\ncolony in time developed its own legislature elected by the voters; it\\ngrew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for itself. Here was a\\npeople learning self-reliance and self-government. The attempts to\\nstrengthen the Church of England in America and the transformation of\\ncolonies into royal provinces only fanned the spirit of independence\\nwhich they were designed to quench.\\n\\nNevertheless, the Americans owed much of their prosperity to the\\nassistance of the government that irritated them. It was the protection\\nof the British navy that prevented Holland, Spain, and France from\\nwiping out their settlements. Though their manufacture and trade were\\ncontrolled in the interests of the mother country, they also enjoyed\\ngreat advantages in her markets. Free trade existed nowhere upon the\\nearth; but the broad empire of Britain was open to American ships and\\nmerchandise. It could be said, with good reason, that the disadvantages\\nwhich the colonists suffered through British regulation of their\\nindustry and trade were more than offset by the privileges they enjoyed.\\nStill that is somewhat beside the point, for mere economic advantage is\\nnot necessarily the determining factor in the fate of peoples. A\\nthousand circumstances had helped to develop on this continent a nation,\\nto inspire it with a passion for independence, and to prepare it for a\\ndestiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of the British\\nempire. The economists, who tried to prove by logic unassailable that\\nAmerica would be richer under the British flag, could not change the\\nspirit of Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, or George\\nWashington.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nG.L.

CONFLICT AND INDEPENDENCE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nTHE NEW COURSE IN BRITISH IMPERIAL POLICY\\n\\n\\nOn October 25, 1760, King George II died and the British crown passed to\\nhis young grandson. The first George, the son of the Elector of Hanover\\nand Sophia the granddaughter of James I, was a thorough German who never\\neven learned to speak the language of the land over which he reigned.\\nThe second George never saw England until he was a man. He spoke English\\nwith an accent and until his death preferred his German home. During\\ntheir reign, the principle had become well established that the king did\\nnot govern but acted only through ministers representing the majority in\\nParliament.\\n\\n\\nGEORGE III AND HIS SYSTEM\\n\\n=The Character of the New King.=--The third George rudely broke the\\nGerman tradition of his family. He resented the imputation that he was a\\nforeigner and on all occasions made a display of his British sympathies.\\nTo the draft of his first speech to Parliament, he added the popular\\nphrase: \"Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of\\nBriton.\" Macaulay, the English historian, certainly of no liking for\\nhigh royal prerogative, said of George: \"The young king was a born\\nEnglishman. All his tastes and habits, good and bad, were English. No\\nportion of his subjects had anything to reproach him with.... His age,\\nhis appearance, and all that was known of his character conciliated\\npublic favor. He was in the bloom of youth; his person and address were\\npleasing; scandal imputed to him no vice; and flattery might without\\nglaring absurdity ascribe to him many princely virtues.\"\\n\\nNevertheless George III had been spoiled by his mother, his tutors, and\\nhis courtiers. Under their influence he developed high and mighty\\nnotions about the sacredness of royal authority and his duty to check\\nthe pretensions of Parliament and the ministers dependent upon it. His\\nmother had dinned into his ears the slogan: \"George, be king!\" Lord\\nBute, his teacher and adviser, had told him that his honor required him\\nto take an active part in the shaping of public policy and the making of\\nlaws. Thus educated, he surrounded himself with courtiers who encouraged\\nhim in the determination to rule as well as reign, to subdue all\\nparties, and to place himself at the head of the nation and empire.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print._\\n\\nGEORGE III]\\n\\n=Political Parties and George III.=--The state of the political parties\\nfavored the plans of the king to restore some of the ancient luster of\\nthe crown. The Whigs, who were composed mainly of the smaller\\nfreeholders, merchants, inhabitants of towns, and Protestant\\nnon-conformists, had grown haughty and overbearing through long\\ncontinuance in power and had as a consequence raised up many enemies in\\ntheir own ranks. Their opponents, the Tories, had by this time given up\\nall hope of restoring to the throne the direct Stuart line; but they\\nstill cherished their old notions about divine right. With the\\naccession of George III the coveted opportunity came to them to rally\\naround the throne again. George received his Tory friends with open\\narms, gave them offices, and bought them seats in the House of Commons.\\n\\n=The British Parliamentary System.=--The peculiarities of the British\\nParliament at the time made smooth the way for the king and his allies\\nwith their designs for controlling the entire government. In the first\\nplace, the House of Lords was composed mainly of hereditary nobles whose\\nnumber the king could increase by the appointment of his favorites, as\\nof old. Though the members of the House of Commons were elected by\\npopular vote, they did not speak for the mass of English people. Great\\ntowns like Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, for example, had no\\nrepresentatives at all. While there were about eight million inhabitants\\nin Great Britain, there were in 1768 only about 160,000 voters; that is\\nto say, only about one in every ten adult males had a voice in the\\ngovernment. Many boroughs returned one or more members to the Commons\\nalthough they had merely a handful of voters or in some instances no\\nvoters at all. Furthermore, these tiny boroughs were often controlled by\\nlords who openly sold the right of representation to the highest bidder.\\nThe \"rotten-boroughs,\" as they were called by reformers, were a public\\nscandal, but George III readily made use of them to get his friends into\\nthe House of Commons.\\n\\n\\nGEORGE III\\'S MINISTERS AND THEIR COLONIAL POLICIES\\n\\n=Grenville and the War Debt.=--Within a year after the accession of\\nGeorge III, William Pitt was turned out of office, the king treating him\\nwith \"gross incivility\" and the crowds shouting \"Pitt forever!\" The\\ndirection of affairs was entrusted to men enjoying the king\\'s\\nconfidence. Leadership in the House of Commons fell to George Grenville,\\na grave and laborious man who for years had groaned over the increasing\\ncost of government.\\n\\nThe first task after the conclusion of peace in 1763 was the adjustment\\nof the disordered finances of the kingdom. The debt stood at the highest\\npoint in the history of the country. More revenue was absolutely\\nnecessary and Grenville began to search for it, turning his attention\\nfinally to the American colonies. In this quest he had the aid of a\\nzealous colleague, Charles Townshend, who had long been in public\\nservice and was familiar with the difficulties encountered by royal\\ngovernors in America. These two men, with the support of the entire\\nministry, inaugurated in February, 1763, \"a new system of colonial\\ngovernment. It was announced by authority that there were to be no more\\nrequisitions from the king to the colonial assemblies for supplies, but\\nthat the colonies were to be taxed instead by act of Parliament.\\nColonial governors and judges were to be paid by the Crown; they were to\\nbe supported by a standing army of twenty regiments; and all the\\nexpenses of this force were to be met by parliamentary taxation.\"\\n\\n=Restriction of Paper Money (1763).=--Among the many complaints filed\\nbefore the board of trade were vigorous protests against the issuance of\\npaper money by the colonial legislatures. The new ministry provided a\\nremedy in the act of 1763, which declared void all colonial laws\\nauthorizing paper money or extending the life of outstanding bills. This\\nlaw was aimed at the \"cheap money\" which the Americans were fond of\\nmaking when specie was scarce--money which they tried to force on their\\nEnglish creditors in return for goods and in payment of the interest and\\nprincipal of debts. Thus the first chapter was written in the long\\nbattle over sound money on this continent.\\n\\n=Limitation on Western Land Sales.=--Later in the same year (1763)\\nGeorge III issued a royal proclamation providing, among other things,\\nfor the government of the territory recently acquired by the treaty of\\nParis from the French. One of the provisions in this royal decree\\ntouched frontiersmen to the quick. The contests between the king\\'s\\nofficers and the colonists over the disposition of western lands had\\nbeen long and sharp. The Americans chafed at restrictions on\\nsettlement. The more adventurous were continually moving west and\\n\"squatting\" on land purchased from the Indians or simply seized without\\nauthority. To put an end to this, the king forbade all further purchases\\nfrom the Indians, reserving to the crown the right to acquire such lands\\nand dispose of them for settlement. A second provision in the same\\nproclamation vested the power of licensing trade with the Indians,\\nincluding the lucrative fur business, in the hands of royal officers in\\nthe colonies. These two limitations on American freedom and enterprise\\nwere declared to be in the interest of the crown and for the\\npreservation of the rights of the Indians against fraud and abuses.\\n\\n=The Sugar Act of 1764.=--King George\\'s ministers next turned their\\nattention to measures of taxation and trade. Since the heavy debt under\\nwhich England was laboring had been largely incurred in the defense of\\nAmerica, nothing seemed more reasonable to them than the proposition\\nthat the colonies should help to bear the burden which fell so heavily\\nupon the English taxpayer. The Sugar Act of 1764 was the result of this\\nreasoning. There was no doubt about the purpose of this law, for it was\\nset forth clearly in the title: \"An act for granting certain duties in\\nthe British colonies and plantations in America ... for applying the\\nproduce of such duties ... towards defraying the expenses of defending,\\nprotecting and securing the said colonies and plantations ... and for\\nmore effectually preventing the clandestine conveyance of goods to and\\nfrom the said colonies and plantations and improving and securing the\\ntrade between the same and Great Britain.\" The old Molasses Act had been\\nprohibitive; the Sugar Act of 1764 was clearly intended as a revenue\\nmeasure. Specified duties were laid upon sugar, indigo, calico, silks,\\nand many other commodities imported into the colonies. The enforcement\\nof the Molasses Act had been utterly neglected; but this Sugar Act had\\n\"teeth in it.\" Special precautions as to bonds, security, and\\nregistration of ship masters, accompanied by heavy penalties, promised\\na vigorous execution of the new revenue law.\\n\\nThe strict terms of the Sugar Act were strengthened by administrative\\nmeasures. Under a law of the previous year the commanders of armed\\nvessels stationed along the American coast were authorized to stop,\\nsearch, and, on suspicion, seize merchant ships approaching colonial\\nports. By supplementary orders, the entire British official force in\\nAmerica was instructed to be diligent in the execution of all trade and\\nnavigation laws. Revenue collectors, officers of the army and navy, and\\nroyal governors were curtly ordered to the front to do their full duty\\nin the matter of law enforcement. The ordinary motives for the discharge\\nof official obligations were sharpened by an appeal to avarice, for\\nnaval officers who seized offenders against the law were rewarded by\\nlarge prizes out of the forfeitures and penalties.\\n\\n=The Stamp Act (1765).=--The Grenville-Townshend combination moved\\nsteadily towards its goal. While the Sugar Act was under consideration\\nin Parliament, Grenville announced a plan for a stamp bill. The next\\nyear it went through both Houses with a speed that must have astounded\\nits authors. The vote in the Commons stood 205 in favor to 49 against;\\nwhile in the Lords it was not even necessary to go through the formality\\nof a count. As George III was temporarily insane, the measure received\\nroyal assent by a commission acting as a board of regency. Protests of\\ncolonial agents in London were futile. \"We might as well have hindered\\nthe sun\\'s progress!\" exclaimed Franklin. Protests of a few opponents in\\nthe Commons were equally vain. The ministry was firm in its course and\\nfrom all appearances the Stamp Act hardly roused as much as a languid\\ninterest in the city of London. In fact, it is recorded that the fateful\\nmeasure attracted less notice than a bill providing for a commission to\\nact for the king when he was incapacitated.\\n\\nThe Stamp Act, like the Sugar Act, declared the purpose of the British\\ngovernment to raise revenue in America \"towards defraying the expenses\\nof defending, protecting, and securing the British colonies and\\nplantations in America.\" It was a long measure of more than fifty\\nsections, carefully planned and skillfully drawn. By its provisions\\nduties were imposed on practically all papers used in legal\\ntransactions,--deeds, mortgages, inventories, writs, bail bonds,--on\\nlicenses to practice law and sell liquor, on college diplomas, playing\\ncards, dice, pamphlets, newspapers, almanacs, calendars, and\\nadvertisements. The drag net was closely knit, for scarcely anything\\nescaped.\\n\\n=The Quartering Act (1765).=--The ministers were aware that the Stamp\\nAct would rouse opposition in America--how great they could not\\nconjecture. While the measure was being debated, a friend of General\\nWolfe, Colonel Barre, who knew America well, gave them an ominous\\nwarning in the Commons. \"Believe me--remember I this day told you so--\"\\nhe exclaimed, \"the same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at\\nfirst will accompany them still ... a people jealous of their liberties\\nand who will vindicate them, if ever they should be violated.\" The\\nanswer of the ministry to a prophecy of force was a threat of force.\\nPreparations were accordingly made to dispatch a larger number of\\nsoldiers than usual to the colonies, and the ink was hardly dry on the\\nStamp Act when Parliament passed the Quartering Act ordering the\\ncolonists to provide accommodations for the soldiers who were to enforce\\nthe new laws. \"We have the power to tax them,\" said one of the ministry,\\n\"and we will tax them.\"\\n\\n\\nCOLONIAL RESISTANCE FORCES REPEAL\\n\\n=Popular Opposition.=--The Stamp Act was greeted in America by an\\noutburst of denunciation. The merchants of the seaboard cities took the\\nlead in making a dignified but unmistakable protest, agreeing not to\\nimport British goods while the hated law stood upon the books. Lawyers,\\nsome of them incensed at the heavy taxes on their operations and others\\nintimidated by patriots who refused to permit them to use stamped\\npapers, joined with the merchants. Aristocratic colonial Whigs, who had\\nlong grumbled at the administration of royal governors, protested\\nagainst taxation without their consent, as the Whigs had done in old\\nEngland. There were Tories, however, in the colonies as in England--many\\nof them of the official class--who denounced the merchants, lawyers, and\\nWhig aristocrats as \"seditious, factious and republican.\" Yet the\\nopposition to the Stamp Act and its accompanying measure, the Quartering\\nAct, grew steadily all through the summer of 1765.\\n\\nIn a little while it was taken up in the streets and along the\\ncountryside. All through the North and in some of the Southern colonies,\\nthere sprang up, as if by magic, committees and societies pledged to\\nresist the Stamp Act to the bitter end. These popular societies were\\nknown as Sons of Liberty and Daughters of Liberty: the former including\\nartisans, mechanics, and laborers; and the latter, patriotic women. Both\\ngroups were alike in that they had as yet taken little part in public\\naffairs. Many artisans, as well as all the women, were excluded from the\\nright to vote for colonial assemblymen.\\n\\nWhile the merchants and Whig gentlemen confined their efforts chiefly to\\ndrafting well-phrased protests against British measures, the Sons of\\nLiberty operated in the streets and chose rougher measures. They stirred\\nup riots in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston when attempts\\nwere made to sell the stamps. They sacked and burned the residences of\\nhigh royal officers. They organized committees of inquisition who by\\nthreats and intimidation curtailed the sale of British goods and the use\\nof stamped papers. In fact, the Sons of Liberty carried their operations\\nto such excesses that many mild opponents of the stamp tax were\\nfrightened and drew back in astonishment at the forces they had\\nunloosed. The Daughters of Liberty in a quieter way were making a very\\neffective resistance to the sale of the hated goods by spurring on\\ndomestic industries, their own particular province being the manufacture\\nof clothing, and devising substitutes for taxed foods. They helped to\\nfeed and clothe their families without buying British goods.\\n\\n=Legislative Action against the Stamp Act.=--Leaders in the colonial\\nassemblies, accustomed to battle against British policies, supported the\\npopular protest. The Stamp Act was signed on March 22, 1765. On May 30,\\nthe Virginia House of Burgesses passed a set of resolutions declaring\\nthat the General Assembly of the colony alone had the right to lay taxes\\nupon the inhabitants and that attempts to impose them otherwise were\\n\"illegal, unconstitutional, and unjust.\" It was in support of these\\nresolutions that Patrick Henry uttered the immortal challenge: \"Caesar\\nhad his Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell, and George III....\" Cries of\\n\"Treason\" were calmly met by the orator who finished: \"George III may\\nprofit by their example. If that be treason, make the most of it.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: PATRICK HENRY]\\n\\n=The Stamp Act Congress.=--The Massachusetts Assembly answered the call\\nof Virginia by inviting the colonies to elect delegates to a Congress to\\nbe held in New York to discuss the situation. Nine colonies responded\\nand sent representatives. The delegates, while professing the warmest\\naffection for the king\\'s person and government, firmly spread on record\\na series of resolutions that admitted of no double meaning. They\\ndeclared that taxes could not be imposed without their consent, given\\nthrough their respective colonial assemblies; that the Stamp Act showed\\na tendency to subvert their rights and liberties; that the recent trade\\nacts were burdensome and grievous; and that the right to petition the\\nking and Parliament was their heritage. They thereupon made \"humble\\nsupplication\" for the repeal of the Stamp Act.\\n\\nThe Stamp Act Congress was more than an assembly of protest. It marked\\nthe rise of a new agency of government to express the will of America.\\nIt was the germ of a government which in time was to supersede the\\ngovernment of George III in the colonies. It foreshadowed the Congress\\nof the United States under the Constitution. It was a successful attempt\\nat union. \"There ought to be no New England men,\" declared Christopher\\nGadsden, in the Stamp Act Congress, \"no New Yorkers known on the\\nContinent, but all of us Americans.\"\\n\\n=The Repeal of the Stamp Act and the Sugar Act.=--The effect of American\\nresistance on opinion in England was telling. Commerce with the colonies\\nhad been effectively boycotted by the Americans; ships lay idly swinging\\nat the wharves; bankruptcy threatened hundreds of merchants in London,\\nBristol, and Liverpool. Workingmen in the manufacturing towns of England\\nwere thrown out of employment. The government had sown folly and was\\nreaping, in place of the coveted revenue, rebellion.\\n\\nPerplexed by the storm they had raised, the ministers summoned to the\\nbar of the House of Commons, Benjamin Franklin, the agent for\\nPennsylvania, who was in London. \"Do you think it right,\" asked\\nGrenville, \"that America should be protected by this country and pay no\\npart of the expenses?\" The answer was brief: \"That is not the case; the\\ncolonies raised, clothed, and paid during the last war twenty-five\\nthousand men and spent many millions.\" Then came an inquiry whether the\\ncolonists would accept a modified stamp act. \"No, never,\" replied\\nFranklin, \"never! They will never submit to it!\" It was next suggested\\nthat military force might compel obedience to law. Franklin had a ready\\nanswer. \"They cannot force a man to take stamps.... They may not find a\\nrebellion; they may, indeed, make one.\"\\n\\nThe repeal of the Stamp Act was moved in the House of Commons a few days\\nlater. The sponsor for the repeal spoke of commerce interrupted, debts\\ndue British merchants placed in jeopardy, Manchester industries closed,\\nworkingmen unemployed, oppression instituted, and the loss of the\\ncolonies threatened. Pitt and Edmund Burke, the former near the close\\nof his career, the latter just beginning his, argued cogently in favor\\nof retracing the steps taken the year before. Grenville refused.\\n\"America must learn,\" he wailed, \"that prayers are not to be brought to\\nCaesar through riot and sedition.\" His protests were idle. The Commons\\nagreed to the repeal on February 22, 1766, amid the cheers of the\\nvictorious majority. It was carried through the Lords in the face of\\nstrong opposition and, on March 18, reluctantly signed by the king, now\\nrestored to his right mind.\\n\\nIn rescinding the Stamp Act, Parliament did not admit the contention of\\nthe Americans that it was without power to tax them. On the contrary, it\\naccompanied the repeal with a Declaratory Act. It announced that the\\ncolonies were subordinate to the crown and Parliament of Great Britain;\\nthat the king and Parliament therefore had undoubted authority to make\\nlaws binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever; and that the\\nresolutions and proceedings of the colonists denying such authority were\\nnull and void.\\n\\nThe repeal was greeted by the colonists with great popular\\ndemonstrations. Bells were rung; toasts to the king were drunk; and\\ntrade resumed its normal course. The Declaratory Act, as a mere paper\\nresolution, did not disturb the good humor of those who again cheered\\nthe name of King George. Their confidence was soon strengthened by the\\nnews that even the Sugar Act had been repealed, thus practically\\nrestoring the condition of affairs before Grenville and Townshend\\ninaugurated their policy of \"thoroughness.\"\\n\\n\\nRESUMPTION OF BRITISH REVENUE AND COMMERCIAL POLICIES\\n\\n=The Townshend Acts (1767).=--The triumph of the colonists was brief.\\nThough Pitt, the friend of America, was once more prime minister, and\\nseated in the House of Lords as the Earl of Chatham, his severe illness\\ngave to Townshend and the Tory party practical control over Parliament.\\nUnconvinced by the experience with the Stamp Act, Townshend brought\\nforward and pushed through both Houses of Parliament three measures,\\nwhich to this day are associated with his name. First among his\\nrestrictive laws was that of June 29, 1767, which placed the enforcement\\nof the collection of duties and customs on colonial imports and exports\\nin the hands of British commissioners appointed by the king, resident in\\nthe colonies, paid from the British treasury, and independent of all\\ncontrol by the colonists. The second measure of the same date imposed a\\ntax on lead, glass, paint, tea, and a few other articles imported into\\nthe colonies, the revenue derived from the duties to be applied toward\\nthe payment of the salaries and other expenses of royal colonial\\nofficials. A third measure was the Tea Act of July 2, 1767, aimed at the\\ntea trade which the Americans carried on illegally with foreigners. This\\nlaw abolished the duty which the East India Company had to pay in\\nEngland on tea exported to America, for it was thought that English tea\\nmerchants might thus find it possible to undersell American tea\\nsmugglers.\\n\\n=Writs of Assistance Legalized by Parliament.=--Had Parliament been\\ncontent with laying duties, just as a manifestation of power and right,\\nand neglected their collection, perhaps little would have been heard of\\nthe Townshend Acts. It provided, however, for the strict, even the\\nharsh, enforcement of the law. It ordered customs officers to remain at\\ntheir posts and put an end to smuggling. In the revenue act of June 29,\\n1767, it expressly authorized the superior courts of the colonies to\\nissue \"writs of assistance,\" empowering customs officers to enter \"any\\nhouse, warehouse, shop, cellar, or other place in the British colonies\\nor plantations in America to search for and seize\" prohibited or\\nsmuggled goods.\\n\\nThe writ of assistance, which was a general search warrant issued to\\nrevenue officers, was an ancient device hateful to a people who\\ncherished the spirit of personal independence and who had made actual\\ngains in the practice of civil liberty. To allow a \"minion of the law\"\\nto enter a man\\'s house and search his papers and premises, was too much\\nfor the emotions of people who had fled to America in a quest for\\nself-government and free homes, who had braved such hardships to\\nestablish them, and who wanted to trade without official interference.\\n\\nThe writ of assistance had been used in Massachusetts in 1755 to prevent\\nillicit trade with Canada and had aroused a violent hostility at that\\ntime. In 1761 it was again the subject of a bitter controversy which\\narose in connection with the application of a customs officer to a\\nMassachusetts court for writs of assistance \"as usual.\" This application\\nwas vainly opposed by James Otis in a speech of five hours\\' duration--a\\nspeech of such fire and eloquence that it sent every man who heard it\\naway \"ready to take up arms against writs of assistance.\" Otis denounced\\nthe practice as an exercise of arbitrary power which had cost one king\\nhis head and another his throne, a tyrant\\'s device which placed the\\nliberty of every man in jeopardy, enabling any petty officer to work\\npossible malice on any innocent citizen on the merest suspicion, and to\\nspread terror and desolation through the land. \"What a scene,\" he\\nexclaimed, \"does this open! Every man, prompted by revenge, ill-humor,\\nor wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbor\\'s house, may get a\\nwrit of assistance. Others will ask it from self-defense; one arbitrary\\nexertion will provoke another until society is involved in tumult and\\nblood.\" He did more than attack the writ itself. He said that Parliament\\ncould not establish it because it was against the British constitution.\\nThis was an assertion resting on slender foundation, but it was quickly\\nechoed by the people. Then and there James Otis sounded the call to\\nAmerica to resist the exercise of arbitrary power by royal officers.\\n\"Then and there,\" wrote John Adams, \"the child Independence was born.\"\\nSuch was the hated writ that Townshend proposed to put into the hands of\\ncustoms officers in his grim determination to enforce the law.\\n\\n=The New York Assembly Suspended.=--In the very month that Townshend\\'s\\nActs were signed by the king, Parliament took a still more drastic step.\\nThe assembly of New York, protesting against the \"ruinous and\\ninsupportable\" expense involved, had failed to make provision for the\\ncare of British troops in accordance with the terms of the Quartering\\nAct. Parliament therefore suspended the assembly until it promised to\\nobey the law. It was not until a third election was held that compliance\\nwith the Quartering Act was wrung from the reluctant province. In the\\nmeantime, all the colonies had learned on how frail a foundation their\\nrepresentative bodies rested.\\n\\n\\nRENEWED RESISTANCE IN AMERICA\\n\\n=The Massachusetts Circular (1768).=--Massachusetts, under the\\nleadership of Samuel Adams, resolved to resist the policy of renewed\\nintervention in America. At his suggestion the assembly adopted a\\nCircular Letter addressed to the assemblies of the other colonies\\ninforming them of the state of affairs in Massachusetts and roundly\\ncondemning the whole British program. The Circular Letter declared that\\nParliament had no right to lay taxes on Americans without their consent\\nand that the colonists could not, from the nature of the case, be\\nrepresented in Parliament. It went on shrewdly to submit to\\nconsideration the question as to whether any people could be called free\\nwho were subjected to governors and judges appointed by the crown and\\npaid out of funds raised independently. It invited the other colonies,\\nin the most temperate tones, to take thought about the common\\npredicament in which they were all placed.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print._\\n\\nSAMUEL ADAMS]\\n\\n=The Dissolution of Assemblies.=--The governor of Massachusetts, hearing\\nof the Circular Letter, ordered the assembly to rescind its appeal. On\\nmeeting refusal, he promptly dissolved it. The Maryland, Georgia, and\\nSouth Carolina assemblies indorsed the Circular Letter and were also\\ndissolved at once. The Virginia House of Burgesses, thoroughly aroused,\\npassed resolutions on May 16, 1769, declaring that the sole right of\\nimposing taxes in Virginia was vested in its legislature, asserting anew\\nthe right of petition to the crown, condemning the transportation of\\npersons accused of crimes or trial beyond the seas, and beseeching the\\nking for a redress of the general grievances. The immediate dissolution\\nof the Virginia assembly, in its turn, was the answer of the royal\\ngovernor.\\n\\n=The Boston Massacre.=--American opposition to the British authorities\\nkept steadily rising as assemblies were dissolved, the houses of\\ncitizens searched, and troops distributed in increasing numbers among\\nthe centers of discontent. Merchants again agreed not to import British\\ngoods, the Sons of Liberty renewed their agitation, and women set about\\nthe patronage of home products still more loyally.\\n\\nOn the night of March 5, 1770, a crowd on the streets of Boston began to\\njostle and tease some British regulars stationed in the town. Things\\nwent from bad to worse until some \"boys and young fellows\" began to\\nthrow snowballs and stones. Then the exasperated soldiers fired into the\\ncrowd, killing five and wounding half a dozen more. The day after the\\n\"massacre,\" a mass meeting was held in the town and Samuel Adams was\\nsent to demand the withdrawal of the soldiers. The governor hesitated\\nand tried to compromise. Finding Adams relentless, the governor yielded\\nand ordered the regulars away.\\n\\nThe Boston Massacre stirred the country from New Hampshire to Georgia.\\nPopular passions ran high. The guilty soldiers were charged with murder.\\nTheir defense was undertaken, in spite of the wrath of the populace, by\\nJohn Adams and Josiah Quincy, who as lawyers thought even the worst\\n\\noffenders entitled to their full rights in law. In his speech to the\\njury, however, Adams warned the British government against its course,\\nsaying, that \"from the nature of things soldiers quartered in a populous\\ntown will always occasion two mobs where they will prevent one.\" Two of\\nthe soldiers were convicted and lightly punished.\\n\\n=Resistance in the South.=--The year following the Boston Massacre some\\ncitizens of North Carolina, goaded by the conduct of the royal governor,\\nopenly resisted his authority. Many were killed as a result and seven\\nwho were taken prisoners were hanged as traitors. A little later royal\\ntroops and local militia met in a pitched battle near Alamance River,\\ncalled the \"Lexington of the South.\"\\n\\n=The _Gaspee_ Affair and the Virginia Resolutions of 1773.=--On sea as\\nwell as on land, friction between the royal officers and the colonists\\nbroke out into overt acts. While patrolling Narragansett Bay looking for\\nsmugglers one day in 1772, the armed ship, _Gaspee_, ran ashore and was\\ncaught fast. During the night several men from Providence boarded the\\nvessel and, after seizing the crew, set it on fire. A royal commission,\\nsent to Rhode Island to discover the offenders and bring them to\\naccount, failed because it could not find a single informer. The very\\nappointment of such a commission aroused the patriots of Virginia to\\naction; and in March, 1773, the House of Burgesses passed a resolution\\ncreating a standing committee of correspondence to develop cooperation\\namong the colonies in resistance to British measures.\\n\\n=The Boston Tea Party.=--Although the British government, finding the\\nTownshend revenue act a failure, repealed in 1770 all the duties except\\nthat on tea, it in no way relaxed its resolve to enforce the other\\ncommercial regulations it had imposed on the colonies. Moreover,\\nParliament decided to relieve the British East India Company of the\\nfinancial difficulties into which it had fallen partly by reason of the\\nTea Act and the colonial boycott that followed. In 1773 it agreed to\\nreturn to the Company the regular import duties, levied in England, on\\nall tea transshipped to America. A small impost of three pence, to be\\ncollected in America, was left as a reminder of the principle laid down\\nin the Declaratory Act that Parliament had the right to tax the\\ncolonists.\\n\\nThis arrangement with the East India Company was obnoxious to the\\ncolonists for several reasons. It was an act of favoritism for one\\nthing, in the interest of a great monopoly. For another thing, it\\npromised to dump on the American market, suddenly, an immense amount of\\ncheap tea and so cause heavy losses to American merchants who had large\\nstocks on hand. It threatened with ruin the business of all those who\\nwere engaged in clandestine trade with the Dutch. It carried with it an\\nirritating tax of three pence on imports. In Charleston, Annapolis, New\\nYork, and Boston, captains of ships who brought tea under this act were\\nroughly handled. One night in December, 1773, a band of Boston citizens,\\ndisguised as Indians, boarded the hated tea ships and dumped the cargo\\ninto the harbor. This was serious business, for it was open, flagrant,\\ndetermined violation of the law. As such the British government viewed\\nit.\\n\\n\\nRETALIATION BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT\\n\\n=Reception of the News of the Tea Riot.=--The news of the tea riot in\\nBoston confirmed King George in his conviction that there should be no\\nsoft policy in dealing with his American subjects. \"The die is cast,\" he\\nstated with evident satisfaction. \"The colonies must either triumph or\\nsubmit.... If we take the resolute part, they will undoubtedly be very\\nmeek.\" Lord George Germain characterized the tea party as \"the\\nproceedings of a tumultuous and riotous rabble who ought, if they had\\nthe least prudence, to follow their mercantile employments and not\\ntrouble themselves with politics and government, which they do not\\nunderstand.\" This expressed, in concise form, exactly the sentiments of\\nLord North, who had then for three years been the king\\'s chief minister.\\nEven Pitt, Lord Chatham, was prepared to support the government in\\nupholding its authority.\\n\\n=The Five Intolerable Acts.=--Parliament, beginning on March 31, 1774,\\npassed five stringent measures, known in American history as the five\\n\"intolerable acts.\" They were aimed at curing the unrest in America. The\\n_first_ of them was a bill absolutely shutting the port of Boston to\\ncommerce with the outside world. The _second_, following closely,\\nrevoked the Massachusetts charter of 1691 and provided furthermore that\\nthe councilors should be appointed by the king, that all judges should\\nbe named by the royal governor, and that town meetings (except to elect\\ncertain officers) could not be held without the governor\\'s consent. A\\n_third_ measure, after denouncing the \"utter subversion of all lawful\\ngovernment\" in the provinces, authorized royal agents to transfer to\\nGreat Britain or to other colonies the trials of officers or other\\npersons accused of murder in connection with the enforcement of the law.\\nThe _fourth_ act legalized the quartering of troops in Massachusetts\\ntowns. The _fifth_ of the measures was the Quebec Act, which granted\\nreligious toleration to the Catholics in Canada, extended the boundaries\\nof Quebec southward to the Ohio River, and established, in this western\\nregion, government by a viceroy.\\n\\nThe intolerable acts went through Parliament with extraordinary\\ncelerity. There was an opposition, alert and informed; but it was\\nineffective. Burke spoke eloquently against the Boston port bill,\\ncondemning it roundly for punishing the innocent with the guilty, and\\nshowing how likely it was to bring grave consequences in its train. He\\nwas heard with respect and his pleas were rejected. The bill passed both\\nhouses without a division, the entry \"unanimous\" being made upon their\\njournals although it did not accurately represent the state of opinion.\\nThe law destroying the charter of Massachusetts passed the Commons by a\\nvote of three to one; and the third intolerable act by a vote of four to\\none. The triumph of the ministry was complete. \"What passed in Boston,\"\\nexclaimed the great jurist, Lord Mansfield, \"is the overt act of High\\nTreason proceeding from our over lenity and want of foresight.\" The\\ncrown and Parliament were united in resorting to punitive measures.\\n\\nIn the colonies the laws were received with consternation. To the\\nAmerican Protestants, the Quebec Act was the most offensive. That\\nproject they viewed not as an act of grace or of mercy but as a direct\\nattempt to enlist French Canadians on the side of Great Britain. The\\nBritish government did not grant religious toleration to Catholics\\neither at home or in Ireland and the Americans could see no good motive\\nin granting it in North America. The act was also offensive because\\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia had, under their charters,\\nlarge claims in the territory thus annexed to Quebec.\\n\\nTo enforce these intolerable acts the military arm of the British\\ngovernment was brought into play. The commander-in-chief of the armed\\nforces in America, General Gage, was appointed governor of\\nMassachusetts. Reinforcements were brought to the colonies, for now King\\nGeorge was to give \"the rebels,\" as he called them, a taste of strong\\nmedicine. The majesty of his law was to be vindicated by force.\\n\\n\\nFROM REFORM TO REVOLUTION IN AMERICA\\n\\n=The Doctrine of Natural Rights.=--The dissolution of assemblies, the\\ndestruction of charters, and the use of troops produced in the colonies\\na new phase in the struggle. In the early days of the contest with the\\nBritish ministry, the Americans spoke of their \"rights as Englishmen\"\\nand condemned the acts of Parliament as unlawful, as violating the\\nprinciples of the English constitution under which they all lived. When\\nthey saw that such arguments had no effect on Parliament, they turned\\nfor support to their \"natural rights.\" The latter doctrine, in the form\\nin which it was employed by the colonists, was as English as the\\nconstitutional argument. John Locke had used it with good effect in\\ndefense of the English revolution in the seventeenth century. American\\nleaders, familiar with the writings of Locke, also took up his thesis in\\nthe hour of their distress. They openly declared that their rights did\\nnot rest after all upon the English constitution or a charter from the\\ncrown. \"Old Magna Carta was not the beginning of all things,\" retorted\\nOtis when the constitutional argument failed. \"A time may come when\\nParliament shall declare every American charter void, but the natural,\\ninherent, and inseparable rights of the colonists as men and as citizens\\nwould remain and whatever became of charters can never be abolished\\nuntil the general conflagration.\" Of the same opinion was the young and\\nimpetuous Alexander Hamilton. \"The sacred rights of mankind,\" he\\nexclaimed, \"are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty\\nrecords. They are written as with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human\\ndestiny by the hand of divinity itself, and can never be erased or\\nobscured by mortal power.\"\\n\\nFirm as the American leaders were in the statement and defense of their\\nrights, there is every reason for believing that in the beginning they\\nhoped to confine the conflict to the realm of opinion. They constantly\\navowed that they were loyal to the king when protesting in the strongest\\nlanguage against his policies. Even Otis, regarded by the loyalists as a\\nfirebrand, was in fact attempting to avert revolution by winning\\nconcessions from England. \"I argue this cause with the greater\\npleasure,\" he solemnly urged in his speech against the writs of\\nassistance, \"as it is in favor of British liberty ... and as it is in\\nopposition to a kind of power, the exercise of which in former periods\\ncost one king of England his head and another his throne.\"\\n\\n=Burke Offers the Doctrine of Conciliation.=--The flooding tide of\\nAmerican sentiment was correctly measured by one Englishman at least,\\nEdmund Burke, who quickly saw that attempts to restrain the rise of\\nAmerican democracy were efforts to reverse the processes of nature. He\\nsaw how fixed and rooted in the nature of things was the American\\nspirit--how inevitable, how irresistible. He warned his countrymen that\\nthere were three ways of handling the delicate situation--and only\\nthree. One was to remove the cause of friction by changing the spirit of\\nthe colonists--an utter impossibility because that spirit was grounded\\nin the essential circumstances of American life. The second was to\\nprosecute American leaders as criminals; of this he begged his\\ncountrymen to beware lest the colonists declare that \"a government\\nagainst which a claim of liberty is tantamount to high treason is a\\ngovernment to which submission is equivalent to slavery.\" The third and\\nright way to meet the problem, Burke concluded, was to accept the\\nAmerican spirit, repeal the obnoxious measures, and receive the colonies\\ninto equal partnership.\\n\\n=Events Produce the Great Decision.=--The right way, indicated by Burke,\\nwas equally impossible to George III and the majority in Parliament. To\\ntheir narrow minds, American opinion was contemptible and American\\nresistance unlawful, riotous, and treasonable. The correct way, in their\\nview, was to dispatch more troops to crush the \"rebels\"; and that very\\nact took the contest from the realm of opinion. As John Adams said:\\n\"Facts are stubborn things.\" Opinions were unseen, but marching soldiers\\nwere visible to the veriest street urchin. \"Now,\" said Gouverneur\\nMorris, \"the sheep, simple as they are, cannot be gulled as heretofore.\"\\nIt was too late to talk about the excellence of the British\\nconstitution. If any one is bewildered by the controversies of modern\\nhistorians as to why the crisis came at last, he can clarify his\\nunderstanding by reading again Edmund Burke\\'s stately oration, _On\\nConciliation with America_.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nG.L.

The\\ncause of Massachusetts became the cause of all the colonies. Opposition\\nto British policy, hitherto local and spasmodic, now took on a national\\ncharacter. To local committees and provincial conventions was added a\\nContinental Congress, appropriately called by Massachusetts on June 17,\\n1774, at the instigation of Samuel Adams. The response to the summons\\nwas electric. By hurried and irregular methods delegates were elected\\nduring the summer, and on September 5 the Congress duly assembled in\\nCarpenter\\'s Hall in Philadelphia. Many of the greatest men in America\\nwere there--George Washington and Patrick Henry from Virginia and John\\nand Samuel Adams from Massachusetts. Every shade of opinion was\\nrepresented. Some were impatient with mild devices; the majority favored\\nmoderation.\\n\\nThe Congress drew up a declaration of American rights and stated in\\nclear and dignified language the grievances of the colonists. It\\napproved the resistance to British measures offered by Massachusetts and\\npromised the united support of all sections. It prepared an address to\\nKing George and another to the people of England, disavowing the idea of\\nindependence but firmly attacking the policies pursued by the British\\ngovernment.\\n\\n=The Non-Importation Agreement.=--The Congress was not content, however,\\nwith professions of faith and with petitions. It took one revolutionary\\nstep. It agreed to stop the importation of British goods into America,\\nand the enforcement of this agreement it placed in the hands of local\\n\"committees of safety and inspection,\" to be elected by the qualified\\nvoters. The significance of this action is obvious. Congress threw\\nitself athwart British law. It made a rule to bind American citizens and\\nto be carried into effect by American officers. It set up a state within\\nthe British state and laid down a test of allegiance to the new order.\\nThe colonists, who up to this moment had been wavering, had to choose\\none authority or the other. They were for the enforcement of the\\nnon-importation agreement or they were against it. They either bought\\nEnglish goods or they did not. In the spirit of the toast--\"May Britain\\nbe wise and America be free\"--the first Continental Congress adjourned\\nin October, having appointed the tenth of May following for the meeting\\nof a second Congress, should necessity require.\\n\\n=Lord North\\'s \"Olive Branch.\"=--When the news of the action of the\\nAmerican Congress reached England, Pitt and Burke warmly urged a repeal\\nof the obnoxious laws, but in vain. All they could wring from the prime\\nminister, Lord North, was a set of \"conciliatory resolutions\" proposing\\nto relieve from taxation any colony that would assume its share of\\nimperial defense and make provision for supporting the local officers of\\nthe crown. This \"olive branch\" was accompanied by a resolution assuring\\nthe king of support at all hazards in suppressing the rebellion and by\\nthe restraining act of March 30, 1775, which in effect destroyed the\\ncommerce of New England.\\n\\n=Bloodshed at Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775).=--Meanwhile the\\nBritish authorities in Massachusetts relaxed none of their efforts in\\nupholding British sovereignty. General Gage, hearing that military\\nstores had been collected at Concord, dispatched a small force to seize\\nthem. By this act he precipitated the conflict he had sought to avoid.\\nAt Lexington, on the road to Concord, occurred \"the little thing\" that\\nproduced \"the great event.\" An unexpected collision beyond the thought\\nor purpose of any man had transferred the contest from the forum to the\\nbattle field.\\n\\n=The Second Continental Congress.=--Though blood had been shed and war\\nwas actually at hand, the second Continental Congress, which met at\\nPhiladelphia in May, 1775, was not yet convinced that conciliation was\\nbeyond human power. It petitioned the king to interpose on behalf of the\\ncolonists in order that the empire might avoid the calamities of civil\\nwar. On the last day of July, it made a temperate but firm answer to\\nLord North\\'s offer of conciliation, stating that the proposal was\\nunsatisfactory because it did not renounce the right to tax or repeal\\nthe offensive acts of Parliament.\\n\\n=Force, the British Answer.=--Just as the representatives of America\\nwere about to present the last petition of Congress to the king on\\nAugust 23, 1775, George III issued a proclamation of rebellion. This\\nannouncement declared that the colonists, \"misled by dangerous and\\nill-designing men,\" were in a state of insurrection; it called on the\\ncivil and military powers to bring \"the traitors to justice\"; and it\\nthreatened with \"condign punishment the authors, perpetrators, and\\nabettors of such traitorous designs.\" It closed with the usual prayer:\\n\"God, save the king.\" Later in the year, Parliament passed a sweeping\\nact destroying all trade and intercourse with America. Congress was\\nsilent at last. Force was also America\\'s answer.\\n\\n\\nAMERICAN INDEPENDENCE\\n\\n=Drifting into War.=--Although the Congress had not given up all hope of\\nreconciliation in the spring and summer of 1775, it had firmly resolved\\nto defend American rights by arms if necessary. It transformed the\\nmilitiamen who had assembled near Boston, after the battle of Lexington,\\ninto a Continental army and selected Washington as commander-in-chief.\\nIt assumed the powers of a government and prepared to raise money, wage\\nwar, and carry on diplomatic relations with foreign countries.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n\\nSPIRIT OF 1776]\\n\\nEvents followed thick and fast. On June 17, the American militia, by\\nthe stubborn defense of Bunker Hill, showed that it could make British\\nregulars pay dearly for all they got. On July 3, Washington took command\\nof the army at Cambridge. In January, 1776, after bitter disappointments\\nin drumming up recruits for its army in England, Scotland, and Ireland,\\nthe British government concluded a treaty with the Landgrave of\\nHesse-Cassel in Germany contracting, at a handsome figure, for thousands\\nof soldiers and many pieces of cannon. This was the crowning insult to\\nAmerica. Such was the view of all friends of the colonies on both sides\\nof the water. Such was, long afterward, the judgment of the conservative\\nhistorian Lecky: \"The conduct of England in hiring German mercenaries to\\nsubdue the essentially English population beyond the Atlantic made\\nreconciliation hopeless and independence inevitable.\" The news of this\\nwretched transaction in German soldiers had hardly reached America\\nbefore there ran all down the coast the thrilling story that Washington\\nhad taken Boston, on March 17, 1776, compelling Lord Howe to sail with\\nhis entire army for Halifax.\\n\\n=The Growth of Public Sentiment in Favor of Independence.=--Events were\\nbearing the Americans away from their old position under the British\\nconstitution toward a final separation. Slowly and against their\\ndesires, prudent and honorable men, who cherished the ties that united\\nthem to the old order and dreaded with genuine horror all thought of\\nrevolution, were drawn into the path that led to the great decision. In\\nall parts of the country and among all classes, the question of the hour\\nwas being debated. \"American independence,\" as the historian Bancroft\\nsays, \"was not an act of sudden passion nor the work of one man or one\\nassembly. It had been discussed in every part of the country by farmers\\nand merchants, by mechanics and planters, by the fishermen along the\\ncoast and the backwoodsmen of the West; in town meetings and from the\\npulpit; at social gatherings and around the camp fires; in county\\nconventions and conferences or committees; in colonial congresses and\\nassemblies.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n\\nTHOMAS PAINE]\\n\\n=Paine\\'s \"Commonsense.\"=--In the midst of this ferment of American\\nopinion, a bold and eloquent pamphleteer broke in upon the hesitating\\npublic with a program for absolute independence, without fears and\\nwithout apologies. In the early days of 1776, Thomas Paine issued the\\nfirst of his famous tracts, \"Commonsense,\" a passionate attack upon the\\nBritish monarchy and an equally passionate plea for American liberty.\\nCasting aside the language of petition with which Americans had hitherto\\naddressed George III, Paine went to the other extreme and assailed him\\nwith many a violent epithet. He condemned monarchy itself as a system\\nwhich had laid the world \"in blood and ashes.\" Instead of praising the\\nBritish constitution under which colonists had been claiming their\\nrights, he brushed it aside as ridiculous, protesting that it was \"owing\\nto the constitution of the people, not to the constitution of the\\ngovernment, that the Crown is not as oppressive in England as in\\nTurkey.\"\\n\\nHaving thus summarily swept away the grounds of allegiance to the old\\norder, Paine proceeded relentlessly to an argument for immediate\\nseparation from Great Britain. There was nothing in the sphere of\\npractical interest, he insisted, which should bind the colonies to the\\nmother country. Allegiance to her had been responsible for the many wars\\nin which they had been involved. Reasons of trade were not less weighty\\nin behalf of independence. \"Our corn will fetch its price in any market\\nin Europe and our imported goods must be paid for, buy them where we\\nwill.\" As to matters of government, \"it is not in the power of Britain\\nto do this continent justice; the business of it will soon be too\\nweighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of\\nconvenience by a power so distant from us and so very ignorant of us.\"\\n\\nThere is accordingly no alternative to independence for America.\\n\"Everything that is right or natural pleads for separation. The blood of\\nthe slain, the weeping voice of nature cries \\'\\'tis time to part.\\' ...\\nArms, the last resort, must decide the contest; the appeal was the\\nchoice of the king and the continent hath accepted the challenge.... The\\nsun never shone on a cause of greater worth. \\'Tis not the affair of a\\ncity, a county, a province or a kingdom, but of a continent.... \\'Tis not\\nthe concern of a day, a year or an age; posterity is involved in the\\ncontest and will be more or less affected to the end of time by the\\nproceedings now. Now is the seed-time of Continental union, faith, and\\nhonor.... O! ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose not only the\\ntyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth.... Let names of Whig and Tory be\\nextinct. Let none other be heard among us than those of a good citizen,\\nan open and resolute friend, and a virtuous supporter of the rights of\\nmankind and of the free and independent states of America.\" As more than\\n100,000 copies were scattered broadcast over the country, patriots\\nexclaimed with Washington: \"Sound doctrine and unanswerable reason!\"\\n\\n=The Drift of Events toward Independence.=--Official support for the\\nidea of independence began to come from many quarters. On the tenth of\\nFebruary, 1776, Gadsden, in the provincial convention of South Carolina,\\nadvocated a new constitution for the colony and absolute independence\\nfor all America. The convention balked at the latter but went half way\\nby abolishing the system of royal administration and establishing a\\ncomplete plan of self-government. A month later, on April 12, the\\nneighboring state of North Carolina uttered the daring phrase from which\\nothers shrank. It empowered its representatives in the Congress to\\nconcur with the delegates of the other colonies in declaring\\nindependence. Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Virginia quickly\\nresponded to the challenge. The convention of the Old Dominion, on May\\n15, instructed its delegates at Philadelphia to propose the independence\\nof the United Colonies and to give the assent of Virginia to the act of\\nseparation. When the resolution was carried the British flag on the\\nstate house was lowered for all time.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Continental Congress was alive to the course of events\\noutside. The subject of independence was constantly being raised. \"Are\\nwe rebels?\" exclaimed Wyeth of Virginia during a debate in February.\\n\"No: we must declare ourselves a free people.\" Others hesitated and\\nspoke of waiting for the arrival of commissioners of conciliation. \"Is\\nnot America already independent?\" asked Samuel Adams a few weeks later.\\n\"Why not then declare it?\" Still there was uncertainty and delegates\\navoided the direct word. A few more weeks elapsed. At last, on May 10,\\nCongress declared that the authority of the British crown in America\\nmust be suppressed and advised the colonies to set up governments of\\ntheir own.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n\\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON READING HIS DRAFT OF THE DECLARATION OF\\nINDEPENDENCE TO THE COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS]\\n\\n=Independence Declared.=--The way was fully prepared, therefore, when,\\non June 7, the Virginia delegation in the Congress moved that \"these\\nunited colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent\\nstates.\" A committee was immediately appointed to draft a formal\\ndocument setting forth the reasons for the act, and on July 2 all the\\nstates save New York went on record in favor of severing their political\\nconnection with Great Britain. Two days later, July 4, Jefferson\\'s draft\\nof the Declaration of Independence, changed in some slight particulars,\\nwas adopted. The old bell in Independence Hall, as it is now known, rang\\nout the glad tidings; couriers swiftly carried the news to the uttermost\\nhamlet and farm. A new nation announced its will to have a place among\\nthe powers of the world.\\n\\nTo some documents is given immortality. The Declaration of Independence\\nis one of them. American patriotism is forever associated with it; but\\npatriotism alone does not make it immortal. Neither does the vigor of\\nits language or the severity of its indictment give it a secure place in\\nthe records of time. The secret of its greatness lies in the simple fact\\nthat it is one of the memorable landmarks in the history of a political\\nideal which for three centuries has been taking form and spreading\\nthroughout the earth, challenging kings and potentates, shaking down\\nthrones and aristocracies, breaking the armies of irresponsible power on\\nbattle fields as far apart as Marston Moor and Chateau-Thierry. That\\nideal, now so familiar, then so novel, is summed up in the simple\\nsentence: \"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\\ngoverned.\"\\n\\nWritten in a \"decent respect for the opinions of mankind,\" to set forth\\nthe causes which impelled the American colonists to separate from\\nBritain, the Declaration contained a long list of \"abuses and\\nusurpations\" which had induced them to throw off the government of King\\nGeorge. That section of the Declaration has passed into \"ancient\"\\nhistory and is seldom read. It is the part laying down a new basis for\\ngovernment and giving a new dignity to the common man that has become a\\nhousehold phrase in the Old World as in the New.\\n\\nIn the more enduring passages there are four fundamental ideas which,\\nfrom the standpoint of the old system of government, were the essence of\\nrevolution: (1) all men are created equal and are endowed by their\\nCreator with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty, and the\\npursuit of happiness; (2) the purpose of government is to secure these\\nrights; (3) governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\\ngoverned; (4) whenever any form of government becomes destructive of\\nthese ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and\\ninstitute new government, laying its foundations on such principles and\\norganizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to\\neffect their safety and happiness. Here was the prelude to the historic\\ndrama of democracy--a challenge to every form of government and every\\nprivilege not founded on popular assent.\\n\\n\\nTHE ESTABLISHMENT OF GOVERNMENT AND THE NEW ALLEGIANCE\\n\\n=The Committees of Correspondence.=--As soon as debate had passed into\\narmed resistance, the patriots found it necessary to consolidate their\\nforces by organizing civil government. This was readily effected, for\\nthe means were at hand in town meetings, provincial legislatures, and\\ncommittees of correspondence. The working tools of the Revolution were\\nin fact the committees of correspondence--small, local, unofficial\\ngroups of patriots formed to exchange views and create public sentiment.\\nAs early as November, 1772, such a committee had been created in Boston\\nunder the leadership of Samuel Adams. It held regular meetings, sent\\nemissaries to neighboring towns, and carried on a campaign of education\\nin the doctrines of liberty.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE COLONIES OF NORTH AMERICA AT THE TIME OF THE\\nDECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE]\\n\\nUpon local organizations similar in character to the Boston committee\\nwere built county committees and then the larger colonial committees,\\ncongresses, and conventions, all unofficial and representing the\\nrevolutionary elements. Ordinarily the provincial convention was merely\\nthe old legislative assembly freed from all royalist sympathizers and\\ncontrolled by patriots. Finally, upon these colonial assemblies was\\nbuilt the Continental Congress, the precursor of union under the\\nArticles of Confederation and ultimately under the Constitution of the\\nUnited States. This was the revolutionary government set up within the\\nBritish empire in America.\\n\\n=State Constitutions Framed.=--With the rise of these new assemblies of\\nthe people, the old colonial governments broke down. From the royal\\nprovinces the governor, the judges, and the high officers fled in haste,\\nand it became necessary to substitute patriot authorities. The appeal to\\nthe colonies advising them to adopt a new form of government for\\nthemselves, issued by the Congress in May, 1776, was quickly acted upon.\\nBefore the expiration of a year, Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\\nDelaware, Maryland, Georgia, and New York had drafted new constitutions\\nas states, not as colonies uncertain of their destinies. Connecticut and\\nRhode Island, holding that their ancient charters were equal to their\\nneeds, merely renounced their allegiance to the king and went on as\\nbefore so far as the form of government was concerned. South Carolina,\\nwhich had drafted a temporary plan early in 1776, drew up a new and more\\ncomplete constitution in 1778. Two years later Massachusetts with much\\ndeliberation put into force its fundamental law, which in most of its\\nessential features remains unchanged to-day.\\n\\nThe new state constitutions in their broad outlines followed colonial\\nmodels. For the royal governor was substituted a governor or president\\nchosen usually by the legislature; but in two instances, New York and\\nMassachusetts, by popular vote. For the provincial council there was\\nsubstituted, except in Georgia, a senate; while the lower house, or\\nassembly, was continued virtually without change. The old property\\nrestriction on the suffrage, though lowered slightly in some states, was\\ncontinued in full force to the great discontent of the mechanics thus\\ndeprived of the ballot. The special qualifications, laid down in several\\nconstitutions, for governors, senators, and representatives, indicated\\nthat the revolutionary leaders were not prepared for any radical\\nexperiments in democracy. The protests of a few women, like Mrs. John\\nAdams of Massachusetts and Mrs. Henry Corbin of Virginia, against a\\ngovernment which excluded them from political rights were treated as\\nmild curiosities of no significance, although in New Jersey women were\\nallowed to vote for many years on the same terms as men.\\n\\nBy the new state constitutions the signs and symbols of royal power, of\\nauthority derived from any source save \"the people,\" were swept aside\\nand republican governments on an imposing scale presented for the first\\ntime to the modern world. Copies of these remarkable documents prepared\\nby plain citizens were translated into French and widely circulated in\\nEurope. There they were destined to serve as a guide and inspiration to\\na generation of constitution-makers whose mission it was to begin the\\ndemocratic revolution in the Old World.\\n\\n=The Articles of Confederation.=--The formation of state constitutions\\nwas an easy task for the revolutionary leaders. They had only to build\\non foundations already laid. The establishment of a national system of\\ngovernment was another matter. There had always been, it must be\\nremembered, a system of central control over the colonies, but Americans\\nhad had little experience in its operation. When the supervision of the\\ncrown of Great Britain was suddenly broken, the patriot leaders,\\naccustomed merely to provincial statesmanship, were poorly trained for\\naction on a national stage.\\n\\nMany forces worked against those who, like Franklin, had a vision of\\nnational destiny. There were differences in economic interest--commerce\\nand industry in the North and the planting system of the South. There\\nwere contests over the apportionment of taxes and the quotas of troops\\nfor common defense. To these practical difficulties were added local\\npride, the vested rights of state and village politicians in their\\nprovincial dignity, and the scarcity of men with a large outlook upon\\nthe common enterprise.\\n\\nNevertheless, necessity compelled them to consider some sort of\\nfederation. The second Continental Congress had hardly opened its work\\nbefore the most sagacious leaders began to urge the desirability of a\\npermanent connection. As early as July, 1775, Congress resolved to go\\ninto a committee of the whole on the state of the union, and Franklin,\\nundaunted by the fate of his Albany plan of twenty years before, again\\npresented a draft of a constitution. Long and desultory debates followed\\nand it was not until late in 1777 that Congress presented to the states\\nthe Articles of Confederation. Provincial jealousies delayed\\nratification, and it was the spring of 1781, a few months before the\\nsurrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, when Maryland, the last of the\\nstates, approved the Articles. This plan of union, though it was all\\nthat could be wrung from the reluctant states, provided for neither a\\nchief executive nor a system of federal courts. It created simply a\\nCongress of delegates in which each state had an equal voice and gave it\\nthe right to call upon the state legislatures for the sinews of\\ngovernment--money and soldiers.\\n\\n=The Application of Tests of Allegiance.=--As the successive steps were\\ntaken in the direction of independent government, the patriots devised\\nand applied tests designed to discover who were for and who were against\\nthe new nation in the process of making. When the first Continental\\nCongress agreed not to allow the importation of British goods, it\\nprovided for the creation of local committees to enforce the rules. Such\\nagencies were duly formed by the choice of men favoring the scheme, all\\nopponents being excluded from the elections. Before these bodies those\\nwho persisted in buying British goods were summoned and warned or\\npunished according to circumstances. As soon as the new state\\nconstitutions were put into effect, local committees set to work in the\\nsame way to ferret out all who were not outspoken in their support of\\nthe new order of things.\\n\\n[Illustration: MOBBING THE TORIES]\\n\\nThese patriot agencies, bearing different names in different sections,\\nwere sometimes ruthless in their methods. They called upon all men to\\nsign the test of loyalty, frequently known as the \"association test.\"\\nThose who refused were promptly branded as outlaws, while some of the\\nmore dangerous were thrown into jail. The prison camp in Connecticut at\\none time held the former governor of New Jersey and the mayor of New\\nYork. Thousands were black-listed and subjected to espionage. The\\nblack-list of Pennsylvania contained the names of nearly five hundred\\npersons of prominence who were under suspicion. Loyalists or Tories who\\nwere bold enough to speak and write against the Revolution were\\nsuppressed and their pamphlets burned. In many places, particularly in\\nthe North, the property of the loyalists was confiscated and the\\nproceeds applied to the cause of the Revolution.\\n\\nThe work of the official agencies for suppression of opposition was\\nsometimes supplemented by mob violence. A few Tories were hanged without\\ntrial, and others were tarred and feathered. One was placed upon a cake\\nof ice and held there \"until his loyalty to King George might cool.\"\\nWhole families were driven out of their homes to find their way as best\\nthey could within the British lines or into Canada, where the British\\ngovernment gave them lands. Such excesses were deplored by Washington,\\nbut they were defended on the ground that in effect a civil war, as well\\nas a war for independence, was being waged.\\n\\n=The Patriots and Tories.=--Thus, by one process or another, those who\\nwere to be citizens of the new republic were separated from those who\\npreferred to be subjects of King George. Just what proportion of the\\nAmericans favored independence and what share remained loyal to the\\nBritish monarchy there is no way of knowing. The question of revolution\\nwas not submitted to popular vote, and on the point of numbers we have\\nconflicting evidence. On the patriot side, there is the testimony of a\\ncareful and informed observer, John Adams, who asserted that two-thirds\\nof the people were for the American cause and not more than one-third\\nopposed the Revolution at all stages.\\n\\nOn behalf of the loyalists, or Tories as they were popularly known,\\nextravagant claims were made. Joseph Galloway, who had been a member of\\nthe first Continental Congress and had fled to England when he saw its\\ntemper, testified before a committee of Parliament in 1779 that not\\none-fifth of the American people supported the insurrection and that\\n\"many more than four-fifths of the people prefer a union with Great\\nBritain upon constitutional principles to independence.\" At the same\\ntime General Robertson, who had lived in America twenty-four years,\\ndeclared that \"more than two-thirds of the people would prefer the\\nking\\'s government to the Congress\\' tyranny.\" In an address to the king\\nin that year a committee of American loyalists asserted that \"the number\\nof Americans in his Majesty\\'s army exceeded the number of troops\\nenlisted by Congress to oppose them.\"\\n\\n=The Character of the Loyalists.=--When General Howe evacuated Boston,\\nmore than a thousand people fled with him. This great company, according\\nto a careful historian, \"formed the aristocracy of the province by\\nvirtue of their official rank; of their dignified callings and\\nprofessions; of their hereditary wealth and of their culture.\" The act\\nof banishment passed by Massachusetts in 1778, listing over 300 Tories,\\n\"reads like the social register of the oldest and noblest families of\\nNew England,\" more than one out of five being graduates of Harvard\\nCollege. The same was true of New York and Philadelphia; namely, that\\nthe leading loyalists were prominent officials of the old order,\\nclergymen and wealthy merchants. With passion the loyalists fought\\nagainst the inevitable or with anguish of heart they left as refugees\\nfor a life of uncertainty in Canada or the mother country.\\n\\n=Tories Assail the Patriots.=--The Tories who remained in America joined\\nthe British army by the thousands or in other ways aided the royal\\ncause. Those who were skillful with the pen assailed the patriots in\\neditorials, rhymes, satires, and political catechisms. They declared\\nthat the members of Congress were \"obscure, pettifogging attorneys,\\nbankrupt shopkeepers, outlawed smugglers, etc.\" The people and their\\nleaders they characterized as \"wretched banditti ... the refuse and\\ndregs of mankind.\" The generals in the army they sneered at as \"men of\\nrank and honor nearly on a par with those of the Congress.\"\\n\\n=Patriot Writers Arouse the National Spirit.=--Stung by Tory taunts,\\npatriot writers devoted themselves to creating and sustaining a public\\nopinion favorable to the American cause. Moreover, they had to combat\\nthe depression that grew out of the misfortunes in the early days of the\\nwar. A terrible disaster befell Generals Arnold and Montgomery in the\\nwinter of 1775 as they attempted to bring Canada into the revolution--a\\ndisaster that cost 5000 men; repeated calamities harassed Washington in\\n1776 as he was defeated on Long Island, driven out of New York City, and\\nbeaten at Harlem Heights and White Plains. These reverses were almost\\ntoo great for the stoutest patriots.\\n\\nPamphleteers, preachers, and publicists rose, however, to meet the needs\\nof the hour. John Witherspoon, provost of the College of New Jersey,\\nforsook the classroom for the field of political controversy. The poet,\\nPhilip Freneau, flung taunts of cowardice at the Tories and celebrated\\nthe spirit of liberty in many a stirring poem. Songs, ballads, plays,\\nand satires flowed from the press in an unending stream. Fast days,\\nbattle anniversaries, celebrations of important steps taken by Congress\\nafforded to patriotic clergymen abundant opportunities for sermons.\\n\"Does Mr. Wiberd preach against oppression?\" anxiously inquired John\\nAdams in a letter to his wife. The answer was decisive. \"The clergy of\\nevery denomination, not excepting the Episcopalian, thunder and lighten\\nevery Sabbath. They pray for Boston and Massachusetts. They thank God\\nmost explicitly and fervently for our remarkable successes. They pray\\nfor the American army.\"\\n\\nThomas Paine never let his pen rest. He had been with the forces of\\nWashington when they retreated from Fort Lee and were harried from New\\nJersey into Pennsylvania. He knew the effect of such reverses on the\\narmy as well as on the public. In December, 1776, he made a second great\\nappeal to his countrymen in his pamphlet, \"The Crisis,\" the first part\\nof which he had written while defeat and gloom were all about him. This\\ntract was a cry for continued support of the Revolution. \"These are the\\ntimes that try men\\'s souls,\" he opened. \"The summer soldier and the\\nsunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his\\ncountry; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men\\nand women.\" Paine laid his lash fiercely on the Tories, branding every\\none as a coward grounded in \"servile, slavish, self-interested fear.\" He\\ndeplored the inadequacy of the militia and called for a real army. He\\nrefuted the charge that the retreat through New Jersey was a disaster\\nand he promised victory soon. \"By perseverance and fortitude,\" he\\nconcluded, \"we have the prospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and\\nsubmission the sad choice of a variety of evils--a ravaged country, a\\ndepopulated city, habitations without safety and slavery without\\nhope.... Look on this picture and weep over it.\" His ringing call to\\narms was followed by another and another until the long contest was\\nover.\\n\\n\\nMILITARY AFFAIRS\\n\\n=The Two Phases of the War.=--The war which opened with the battle of\\nLexington, on April 19, 1775, and closed with the surrender of\\nCornwallis at Yorktown on October 19, 1781, passed through two distinct\\nphases--the first lasting until the treaty of alliance with France, in\\n1778, and the second until the end of the struggle. During the first\\nphase, the war was confined mainly to the North. The outstanding\\nfeatures of the contest were the evacuation of Boston by the British,\\nthe expulsion of American forces from New York and their retreat through\\nNew Jersey, the battle of Trenton, the seizure of Philadelphia by the\\nBritish (September, 1777), the invasion of New York by Burgoyne and his\\ncapture at Saratoga in October, 1777, and the encampment of American\\nforces at Valley Forge for the terrible winter of 1777-78.\\n\\nThe final phase of the war, opening with the treaty of alliance with\\nFrance on February 6, 1778, was confined mainly to the Middle states,\\nthe West, and the South. In the first sphere of action the chief events\\nwere the withdrawal of the British from Philadelphia, the battle of\\nMonmouth, and the inclosure of the British in New York by deploying\\nAmerican forces from Morristown, New Jersey, up to West Point. In the\\nWest, George Rogers Clark, by his famous march into the Illinois\\ncountry, secured Kaskaskia and Vincennes and laid a firm grip on the\\ncountry between the Ohio and the Great Lakes. In the South, the second\\nperiod opened with successes for the British. They captured Savannah,\\nconquered Georgia, and restored the royal governor. In 1780 they seized\\nCharleston, administered a crushing defeat to the American forces under\\nGates at Camden, and overran South Carolina, though meeting reverses at\\nCowpens and King\\'s Mountain. Then came the closing scenes. Cornwallis\\nbegan the last of his operations. He pursued General Greene far into\\nNorth Carolina, clashed with him at Guilford Court House, retired to the\\ncoast, took charge of British forces engaged in plundering Virginia, and\\nfortified Yorktown, where he was penned up by the French fleet from the\\nsea and the combined French and American forces on land.\\n\\n=The Geographical Aspects of the War.=--For the British the theater of\\nthe war offered many problems. From first to last it extended from\\nMassachusetts to Georgia, a distance of almost a thousand miles. It was\\nnearly three thousand miles from the main base of supplies and, though\\nthe British navy kept the channel open, transports were constantly\\nfalling prey to daring privateers and fleet American war vessels. The\\nsea, on the other hand, offered an easy means of transportation between\\npoints along the coast and gave ready access to the American centers of\\nwealth and population. Of this the British made good use. Though early\\nforced to give up Boston, they seized New York and kept it until the end\\nof the war; they took Philadelphia and retained it until threatened by\\nthe approach of the French fleet; and they captured and held both\\nSavannah and Charleston. Wars, however, are seldom won by the conquest\\nof cities.\\n\\nParticularly was this true in the case of the Revolution. Only a small\\nportion of the American people lived in towns. Countrymen back from the\\ncoast were in no way dependent upon them for a livelihood. They lived on\\nthe produce of the soil, not upon the profits of trade. This very fact\\ngave strength to them in the contest. Whenever the British ventured far\\nfrom the ports of entry, they encountered reverses. Burgoyne was forced\\nto surrender at Saratoga because he was surrounded and cut off from his\\nbase of supplies. As soon as the British got away from Charleston, they\\nwere harassed and worried by the guerrilla warriors of Marion, Sumter,\\nand Pickens. Cornwallis could technically defeat Greene at Guilford far\\nin the interior; but he could not hold the inland region he had invaded.\\nSustained by their own labor, possessing the interior to which their\\narmies could readily retreat, supplied mainly from native resources, the\\nAmericans could not be hemmed in, penned up, and destroyed at one fell\\nblow.\\n\\n=The Sea Power.=--The British made good use of their fleet in cutting\\noff American trade, but control of the sea did not seriously affect the\\nUnited States. As an agricultural country, the ruin of its commerce was\\nnot such a vital matter. All the materials for a comfortable though\\nsomewhat rude life were right at hand. It made little difference to a\\nnation fighting for existence, if silks, fine linens, and chinaware were\\ncut off. This was an evil to which submission was necessary.\\n\\nNor did the brilliant exploits of John Paul Jones and Captain John Barry\\nmaterially change the situation. They demonstrated the skill of American\\nseamen and their courage as fighting men. They raised the rates of\\nBritish marine insurance, but they did not dethrone the mistress of the\\nseas. Less spectacular, and more distinctive, were the deeds of the\\nhundreds of privateers and minor captains who overhauled British supply\\nships and kept British merchantmen in constant anxiety. Not until the\\nFrench fleet was thrown into the scale, were the British compelled to\\nreckon seriously with the enemy on the sea and make plans based upon the\\npossibilities of a maritime disaster.\\n\\n=Commanding Officers.=--On the score of military leadership it is\\ndifficult to compare the contending forces in the revolutionary contest.\\nThere is no doubt that all the British commanders were men of experience\\nin the art of warfare. Sir William Howe had served in America during the\\nFrench War and was accounted an excellent officer, a strict\\ndisciplinarian, and a gallant gentleman. Nevertheless he loved ease,\\nsociety, and good living, and his expulsion from Boston, his failure to\\noverwhelm Washington by sallies from his comfortable bases at New York\\nand Philadelphia, destroyed every shred of his military reputation. John\\nBurgoyne, to whom was given the task of penetrating New York from\\nCanada, had likewise seen service in the French War both in America and\\nEurope. He had, however, a touch of the theatrical in his nature and\\nafter the collapse of his plans and the surrender of his army in 1777,\\nhe devoted his time mainly to light literature. Sir Henry Clinton, who\\ndirected the movement which ended in the capture of Charleston in 1780,\\nhad \"learned his trade on the continent,\" and was regarded as a man of\\ndiscretion and understanding in military matters. Lord Cornwallis, whose\\nachievements at Camden and Guilford were blotted out by his surrender at\\nYorktown, had seen service in the Seven Years\\' War and had undoubted\\ntalents which he afterward displayed with great credit to himself in\\nIndia. Though none of them, perhaps, were men of first-rate ability,\\nthey all had training and experience to guide them.\\n\\n[Illustration: GEORGE WASHINGTON]\\n\\nThe Americans had a host in Washington himself. He had long been\\ninterested in military strategy and had tested his coolness under fire\\nduring the first clashes with the French nearly twenty years before. He\\nhad no doubts about the justice of his cause, such as plagued some of\\nthe British generals. He was a stern but reasonable disciplinarian. He\\nwas reserved and patient, little given to exaltation at success or\\ndepression at reverses. In the dark hour of the Revolution, \"what held\\nthe patriot forces together?\" asks Beveridge in his _Life of John\\nMarshall_. Then he answers: \"George Washington and he alone. Had he\\ndied or been seriously disabled, the Revolution would have ended....\\nWashington was the soul of the American cause. Washington was the\\ngovernment. Washington was the Revolution.\" The weakness of Congress in\\nfurnishing men and supplies, the indolence of civilians, who lived at\\nease while the army starved, the intrigues of army officers against him\\nsuch as the \"Conway cabal,\" the cowardice of Lee at Monmouth, even the\\ntreason of Benedict Arnold, while they stirred deep emotions in his\\nbreast and aroused him to make passionate pleas to his countrymen, did\\nnot shake his iron will or his firm determination to see the war through\\nto the bitter end. The weight of Washington\\'s moral force was\\nimmeasurable.\\n\\nOf the generals who served under him, none can really be said to have\\nbeen experienced military men when the war opened. Benedict Arnold, the\\nunhappy traitor but brave and daring soldier, was a druggist, book\\nseller, and ship owner at New Haven when the news of Lexington called\\nhim to battle. Horatio Gates was looked upon as a \"seasoned soldier\"\\nbecause he had entered the British army as a youth, had been wounded at\\nBraddock\\'s memorable defeat, and had served with credit during the Seven\\nYears\\' War; but he was the most conspicuous failure of the Revolution.\\nThe triumph over Burgoyne was the work of other men; and his crushing\\ndefeat at Camden put an end to his military pretensions. Nathanael\\nGreene was a Rhode Island farmer and smith without military experience\\nwho, when convinced that war was coming, read Caesar\\'s _Commentaries_ and\\ntook up the sword. Francis Marion was a shy and modest planter of South\\nCarolina whose sole passage at arms had been a brief but desperate brush\\nwith the Indians ten or twelve years earlier. Daniel Morgan, one of the\\nheroes of Cowpens, had been a teamster with Braddock\\'s army and had seen\\nsome fighting during the French and Indian War, but his military\\nknowledge, from the point of view of a trained British officer, was\\nnegligible. John Sullivan was a successful lawyer at Durham, New\\nHampshire, and a major in the local militia when duty summoned him to\\nlay down his briefs and take up the sword. Anthony Wayne was a\\nPennsylvania farmer and land surveyor who, on hearing the clash of arms,\\nread a few books on war, raised a regiment, and offered himself for\\nservice. Such is the story of the chief American military leaders, and\\nit is typical of them all. Some had seen fighting with the French and\\nIndians, but none of them had seen warfare on a large scale with regular\\ntroops commanded according to the strategy evolved in European\\nexperience. Courage, native ability, quickness of mind, and knowledge of\\nthe country they had in abundance, and in battles such as were fought\\nduring the Revolution all those qualities counted heavily in the\\nbalance.\\n\\n=Foreign Officers in American Service.=--To native genius was added\\nmilitary talent from beyond the seas. Baron Steuben, well schooled in\\nthe iron regime of Frederick the Great, came over from Prussia, joined\\nWashington at Valley Forge, and day after day drilled and manoeuvered the\\nmen, laughing and cursing as he turned raw countrymen into regular\\nsoldiers. From France came young Lafayette and the stern De Kalb, from\\nPoland came Pulaski and Kosciusko;--all acquainted with the arts of war\\nas waged in Europe and fitted for leadership as well as teaching.\\nLafayette came early, in 1776, in a ship of his own, accompanied by\\nseveral officers of wide experience, and remained loyally throughout the\\nwar sharing the hardships of American army life. Pulaski fell at the\\nsiege of Savannah and De Kalb at Camden. Kosciusko survived the American\\nwar to defend in vain the independence of his native land. To these\\ndistinguished foreigners, who freely threw in their lot with American\\nrevolutionary fortunes, was due much of that spirit and discipline which\\nfitted raw recruits and temperamental militiamen to cope with a military\\npower of the first rank.\\n\\n=The Soldiers.=--As far as the British soldiers were concerned their\\nannals are short and simple. The regulars from the standing army who\\nwere sent over at the opening of the contest, the recruits drummed up\\nby special efforts at home, and the thousands of Hessians bought\\noutright by King George presented few problems of management to the\\nBritish officers. These common soldiers were far away from home and\\nenlisted for the war. Nearly all of them were well disciplined and many\\nof them experienced in actual campaigns. The armies of King George\\nfought bravely, as the records of Bunker Hill, Brandywine, and Monmouth\\ndemonstrate. Many a man and subordinate officer and, for that matter,\\nsome of the high officers expressed a reluctance at fighting against\\ntheir own kin; but they obeyed orders.\\n\\nThe Americans, on the other hand, while they fought with grim\\ndetermination, as men fighting for their homes, were lacking in\\ndiscipline and in the experience of regular troops. When the war broke\\nin upon them, there were no common preparations for it. There was no\\ncontinental army; there were only local bands of militiamen, many of\\nthem experienced in fighting but few of them \"regulars\" in the military\\nsense. Moreover they were volunteers serving for a short time,\\nunaccustomed to severe discipline, and impatient at the restraints\\nimposed on them by long and arduous campaigns. They were continually\\nleaving the service just at the most critical moments. \"The militia,\"\\nlamented Washington, \"come in, you cannot tell how; go, you cannot tell\\nwhere; consume your provisions; exhaust your stores; and leave you at\\nlast at a critical moment.\"\\n\\nAgain and again Washington begged Congress to provide for an army of\\nregulars enlisted for the war, thoroughly trained and paid according to\\nsome definite plan. At last he was able to overcome, in part at least,\\nthe chronic fear of civilians in Congress and to wring from that\\nreluctant body an agreement to grant half pay to all officers and a\\nbonus to all privates who served until the end of the war. Even this\\nscheme, which Washington regarded as far short of justice to the\\nsoldiers, did not produce quick results. It was near the close of the\\nconflict before he had an army of well-disciplined veterans capable of\\nmeeting British regulars on equal terms.\\n\\nThough there were times when militiamen and frontiersmen did valiant and\\neffective work, it is due to historical accuracy to deny the\\ntime-honored tradition that a few minutemen overwhelmed more numerous\\nforces of regulars in a seven years\\' war for independence. They did\\nnothing of the sort. For the victories of Bennington, Trenton, Saratoga,\\nand Yorktown there were the defeats of Bunker Hill, Long Island, White\\nPlains, Germantown, and Camden. Not once did an army of militiamen\\novercome an equal number of British regulars in an open trial by battle.\\n\"To bring men to be well acquainted with the duties of a soldier,\" wrote\\nWashington, \"requires time.... To expect the same service from raw and\\nundisciplined recruits as from veteran soldiers is to expect what never\\ndid and perhaps never will happen.\"\\n\\n=How the War Was Won.=--Then how did the American army win the war? For\\none thing there were delays and blunders on the part of the British\\ngenerals who, in 1775 and 1776, dallied in Boston and New York with\\nlarge bodies of regular troops when they might have been dealing\\nparalyzing blows at the scattered bands that constituted the American\\narmy. \"Nothing but the supineness or folly of the enemy could have saved\\nus,\" solemnly averred Washington in 1780. Still it is fair to say that\\nthis apparent supineness was not all due to the British generals. The\\nministers behind them believed that a large part of the colonists were\\nloyal and that compromise would be promoted by inaction rather than by a\\nwar vigorously prosecuted. Victory by masterly inactivity was obviously\\nbetter than conquest, and the slighter the wounds the quicker the\\nhealing. Later in the conflict when the seasoned forces of France were\\nthrown into the scale, the Americans themselves had learned many things\\nabout the practical conduct of campaigns. All along, the British were\\nembarrassed by the problem of supplies. Their troops could not forage\\nwith the skill of militiamen, as they were in unfamiliar territory. The\\nlong oversea voyages were uncertain at best and doubly so when the\\nwarships of France joined the American privateers in preying on supply\\nboats.\\n\\nThe British were in fact battered and worn down by a guerrilla war and\\noutdone on two important occasions by superior forces--at Saratoga and\\nYorktown. Stern facts convinced them finally that an immense army, which\\ncould be raised only by a supreme effort, would be necessary to subdue\\nthe colonies if that hazardous enterprise could be accomplished at all.\\nThey learned also that America would then be alienated, fretful, and the\\nscene of endless uprisings calling for an army of occupation. That was a\\nprice which staggered even Lord North and George III. Moreover, there\\nwere forces of opposition at home with which they had to reckon.\\n\\n=Women and the War.=--At no time were the women of America indifferent\\nto the struggle for independence. When it was confined to the realm of\\nopinion they did their part in creating public sentiment. Mrs. Elizabeth\\nTimothee, for example, founded in Charleston, in 1773, a newspaper to\\nespouse the cause of the province. Far to the north the sister of James\\nOtis, Mrs. Mercy Warren, early begged her countrymen to rest their case\\nupon their natural rights, and in influential circles she urged the\\nleaders to stand fast by their principles. While John Adams was tossing\\nabout with uncertainty at the Continental Congress, his wife was writing\\nletters to him declaring her faith in \"independency.\"\\n\\nWhen the war came down upon the country, women helped in every field. In\\nsustaining public sentiment they were active. Mrs. Warren with a\\ntireless pen combatted loyalist propaganda in many a drama and satire.\\nAlmost every revolutionary leader had a wife or daughter who rendered\\nservice in the \"second line of defense.\" Mrs. Washington managed the\\nplantation while the General was at the front and went north to face the\\nrigors of the awful winter at Valley Forge--an inspiration to her\\nhusband and his men. The daughter of Benjamin Franklin, Mrs. Sarah\\nBache, while her father was pleading the American cause in France, set\\nthe women of Pennsylvania to work sewing and collecting supplies. Even\\nnear the firing line women were to be found, aiding the wounded, hauling\\npowder to the front, and carrying dispatches at the peril of their\\nlives.\\n\\nIn the economic sphere, the work of women was invaluable. They harvested\\ncrops without enjoying the picturesque title of \"farmerettes\" and they\\ncanned and preserved for the wounded and the prisoners of war. Of their\\nlabor in spinning and weaving it is recorded: \"Immediately on being cut\\noff from the use of English manufactures, the women engaged within their\\nown families in manufacturing various kinds of cloth for domestic use.\\nThey thus kept their households decently clad and the surplus of their\\nlabors they sold to such as chose to buy rather than make for\\nthemselves. In this way the female part of families by their industry\\nand strict economy frequently supported the whole domestic circle,\\nevincing the strength of their attachment and the value of their\\nservice.\"\\n\\nFor their war work, women were commended by high authorities on more\\nthan one occasion. They were given medals and public testimonials even\\nas in our own day. Washington thanked them for their labors and paid\\ntribute to them for the inspiration and material aid which they had\\ngiven to the cause of independence.\\n\\n\\nTHE FINANCES OF THE REVOLUTION\\n\\nWhen the Revolution opened, there were thirteen little treasuries in\\nAmerica but no common treasury, and from first to last the Congress was\\nin the position of a beggar rather than a sovereign. Having no authority\\nto lay and collect taxes directly and knowing the hatred of the\\nprovincials for taxation, it resorted mainly to loans and paper money to\\nfinance the war. \"Do you think,\" boldly inquired one of the delegates,\\n\"that I will consent to load my constituents with taxes when we can send\\nto the printer and get a wagon load of money, one quire of which will\\npay for the whole?\"\\n\\n=Paper Money and Loans.=--Acting on this curious but appealing political\\neconomy, Congress issued in June, 1776, two million dollars in bills of\\ncredit to be redeemed by the states on the basis of their respective\\npopulations. Other issues followed in quick succession. In all about\\n$241,000,000 of continental paper was printed, to which the several\\nstates added nearly $210,000,000 of their own notes. Then came\\ninterest-bearing bonds in ever increasing quantities. Several millions\\nwere also borrowed from France and small sums from Holland and Spain. In\\ndesperation a national lottery was held, producing meager results. The\\nproperty of Tories was confiscated and sold, bringing in about\\n$16,000,000. Begging letters were sent to the states asking them to\\nraise revenues for the continental treasury, but the states, burdened\\nwith their own affairs, gave little heed.\\n\\n=Inflation and Depreciation.=--As paper money flowed from the press, it\\nrapidly declined in purchasing power until in 1779 a dollar was worth\\nonly two or three cents in gold or silver. Attempts were made by\\nCongress and the states to compel people to accept the notes at face\\nvalue; but these were like attempts to make water flow uphill.\\nSpeculators collected at once to fatten on the calamities of the\\nrepublic. Fortunes were made and lost gambling on the prices of public\\nsecurities while the patriot army, half clothed, was freezing at Valley\\nForge. \"Speculation, peculation, engrossing, forestalling,\" exclaimed\\nWashington, \"afford too many melancholy proofs of the decay of public\\nvirtue. Nothing, I am convinced, but the depreciation of our currency\\n... aided by stock jobbing and party dissensions has fed the hopes of\\nthe enemy.\"\\n\\n=The Patriot Financiers.=--To the efforts of Congress in financing the\\nwar were added the labors of private citizens. Hayn Solomon, a merchant\\nof Philadelphia, supplied members of Congress, including Madison,\\nJefferson, and Monroe, and army officers, like Lee and Steuben, with\\nmoney for their daily needs. All together he contributed the huge sum of\\nhalf a million dollars to the American cause and died broken in purse,\\nif not in spirit, a British prisoner of war. Another Philadelphia\\nmerchant, Robert Morris, won for himself the name of the \"patriot\\nfinancier\" because he labored night and day to find the money to meet\\nthe bills which poured in upon the bankrupt government. When his own\\nfunds were exhausted, he borrowed from his friends. Experienced in the\\nhandling of merchandise, he created agencies at important points to\\ndistribute supplies to the troops, thus displaying administrative as\\nwell as financial talents.\\n\\n[Illustration: ROBERT MORRIS]\\n\\nWomen organized \"drives\" for money, contributed their plate and their\\njewels, and collected from door to door. Farmers took worthless paper in\\nreturn for their produce, and soldiers saw many a pay day pass without\\nyielding them a penny. Thus by the labors and sacrifices of citizens,\\nthe issuance of paper money, lotteries, the floating of loans,\\nborrowings in Europe, and the impressment of supplies, the Congress\\nstaggered through the Revolution like a pauper who knows not how his\\nnext meal is to be secured but is continuously relieved at a crisis by a\\nkindly fate.\\n\\n\\nTHE DIPLOMACY OF THE REVOLUTION\\n\\nWhen the full measure of honor is given to the soldiers and sailors and\\ntheir commanding officers, the civilians who managed finances and\\nsupplies, the writers who sustained the American spirit, and the women\\nwho did well their part, there yet remains the duty of recognizing the\\nachievements of diplomacy. The importance of this field of activity was\\nkeenly appreciated by the leaders in the Continental Congress. They were\\nfairly well versed in European history. They knew of the balance of\\npower and the sympathies, interests, and prejudices of nations and their\\nrulers. All this information they turned to good account, in opening\\nrelations with continental countries and seeking money, supplies, and\\neven military assistance. For the transaction of this delicate business,\\nthey created a secret committee on foreign correspondence as early as\\n1775 and prepared to send agents abroad.\\n\\n=American Agents Sent Abroad.=--Having heard that France was inclining a\\nfriendly ear to the American cause, the Congress, in March, 1776, sent a\\ncommissioner to Paris, Silas Deane of Connecticut, often styled the\\n\"first American diplomat.\" Later in the year a form of treaty to be\\npresented to foreign powers was drawn up, and Franklin, Arthur Lee, and\\nDeane were selected as American representatives at the court of \"His\\nMost Christian Majesty the King of France.\" John Jay of New York was\\nchosen minister to Spain in 1779; John Adams was sent to Holland the\\nsame year; and other agents were dispatched to Florence, Vienna, and\\nBerlin. The representative selected for St. Petersburg spent two\\nfruitless years there, \"ignored by the court, living in obscurity and\\nexperiencing nothing but humiliation and failure.\" Frederick the Great,\\nking of Prussia, expressed a desire to find in America a market for\\nSilesian linens and woolens, but, fearing England\\'s command of the sea,\\nhe refused to give direct aid to the Revolutionary cause.\\n\\n=Early French Interest.=--The great diplomatic triumph of the Revolution\\nwas won at Paris, and Benjamin Franklin was the hero of the occasion,\\nalthough many circumstances prepared the way for his success. Louis\\nXVI\\'s foreign minister, Count de Vergennes, before the arrival of any\\nAmerican representative, had brought to the attention of the king the\\nopportunity offered by the outbreak of the war between England and her\\ncolonies. He showed him how France could redress her grievances and\\n\"reduce the power and greatness of England\"--the empire that in 1763 had\\nforced upon her a humiliating peace \"at the price of our possessions,\\nof our commerce, and our credit in the Indies, at the price of Canada,\\nLouisiana, Isle Royale, Acadia, and Senegal.\" Equally successful in\\ngaining the king\\'s interest was a curious French adventurer,\\nBeaumarchais, a man of wealth, a lover of music, and the author of two\\npopular plays, \"Figaro\" and \"The Barber of Seville.\" These two men had\\nalready urged upon the king secret aid for America before Deane appeared\\non the scene. Shortly after his arrival they made confidential\\narrangements to furnish money, clothing, powder, and other supplies to\\nthe struggling colonies, although official requests for them were\\nofficially refused by the French government.\\n\\n=Franklin at Paris.=--When Franklin reached Paris, he was received only\\nin private by the king\\'s minister, Vergennes. The French people,\\nhowever, made manifest their affection for the \"plain republican\" in\\n\"his full dress suit of spotted Manchester velvet.\" He was known among\\nmen of letters as an author, a scientist, and a philosopher of\\nextraordinary ability. His \"Poor Richard\" had thrice been translated\\ninto French and was scattered in numerous editions throughout the\\nkingdom. People of all ranks--ministers, ladies at court, philosophers,\\npeasants, and stable boys--knew of Franklin and wished him success in\\nhis mission. The queen, Marie Antoinette, fated to lose her head in a\\nrevolution soon to follow, played with fire by encouraging \"our dear\\nrepublican.\"\\n\\nFor the king of France, however, this was more serious business. England\\nresented the presence of this \"traitor\" in Paris, and Louis had to be\\ncautious about plunging into another war that might also end\\ndisastrously. Moreover, the early period of Franklin\\'s sojourn in Paris\\nwas a dark hour for the American Revolution. Washington\\'s brilliant\\nexploit at Trenton on Christmas night, 1776, and the battle with\\nCornwallis at Princeton had been followed by the disaster at Brandywine,\\nthe loss of Philadelphia, the defeat at Germantown, and the retirement\\nto Valley Forge for the winter of 1777-78. New York City and\\nPhiladelphia--two strategic ports--were in British hands; the Hudson\\nand Delaware rivers were blocked; and General Burgoyne with his British\\ntroops was on his way down through the heart of northern New York,\\ncutting New England off from the rest of the colonies. No wonder the\\nking was cautious. Then the unexpected happened. Burgoyne, hemmed in\\nfrom all sides by the American forces, his flanks harried, his foraging\\nparties beaten back, his supplies cut off, surrendered on October 17,\\n1777, to General Gates, who had superseded General Schuyler in time to\\nreceive the honor.\\n\\n=Treaties of Alliance and Commerce (1778).=--News of this victory,\\nplaced by historians among the fifteen decisive battles of the world,\\nreached Franklin one night early in December while he and some friends\\nsat gloomily at dinner. Beaumarchais, who was with him, grasped at once\\nthe meaning of the situation and set off to the court at Versailles with\\nsuch haste that he upset his coach and dislocated his arm. The king and\\nhis ministers were at last convinced that the hour had come to aid the\\nRevolution. Treaties of commerce and alliance were drawn up and signed\\nin February, 1778. The independence of the United States was recognized\\nby France and an alliance was formed to guarantee that independence.\\nCombined military action was agreed upon and Louis then formally\\ndeclared war on England. Men who had, a few short years before, fought\\none another in the wilderness of Pennsylvania or on the Plains of\\nAbraham, were now ranged side by side in a war on the Empire that Pitt\\nhad erected and that George III was pulling down.\\n\\n=Spain and Holland Involved.=--Within a few months, Spain, remembering\\nthe steady decline of her sea power since the days of the Armada and\\nhoping to drive the British out of Gibraltar, once more joined the\\nconcert of nations against England. Holland, a member of a league of\\narmed neutrals formed in protest against British searches on the high\\nseas, sent her fleet to unite with the forces of Spain, France, and\\nAmerica to prey upon British commerce. To all this trouble for England\\nwas added the danger of a possible revolt in Ireland, where the spirit\\nof independence was flaming up.\\n\\n=The British Offer Terms to America.=--Seeing the colonists about to be\\njoined by France in a common war on the English empire, Lord North\\nproposed, in February, 1778, a renewal of negotiations. By solemn\\nenactment, Parliament declared its intention not to exercise the right\\nof imposing taxes within the colonies; at the same time it authorized\\nthe opening of negotiations through commissioners to be sent to America.\\nA truce was to be established, pardons granted, objectionable laws\\nsuspended, and the old imperial constitution, as it stood before the\\nopening of hostilities, restored to full vigor. It was too late. Events\\nhad taken the affairs of America out of the hands of British\\ncommissioners and diplomats.\\n\\n=Effects of French Aid.=--The French alliance brought ships of war,\\nlarge sums of gold and silver, loads of supplies, and a considerable\\nbody of trained soldiers to the aid of the Americans. Timely as was this\\nhelp, it meant no sudden change in the fortunes of war. The British\\nevacuated Philadelphia in the summer following the alliance, and\\nWashington\\'s troops were encouraged to come out of Valley Forge. They\\ninflicted a heavy blow on the British at Monmouth, but the treasonable\\nconduct of General Charles Lee prevented a triumph. The recovery of\\nPhiladelphia was offset by the treason of Benedict Arnold, the loss of\\nSavannah and Charleston (1780), and the defeat of Gates at Camden.\\n\\nThe full effect of the French alliance was not felt until 1781, when\\nCornwallis went into Virginia and settled at Yorktown. Accompanied by\\nFrench troops Washington swept rapidly southward and penned the British\\nto the shore while a powerful French fleet shut off their escape by sea.\\nIt was this movement, which certainly could not have been executed\\nwithout French aid, that put an end to all chance of restoring British\\ndominion in America. It was the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown that\\ncaused Lord North to pace the floor and cry out: \"It is all over! It is\\nall over!\" What might have been done without the French alliance lies\\nhidden from mankind. What was accomplished with the help of French\\nsoldiers, sailors, officers, money, and supplies, is known to all the\\nearth. \"All the world agree,\" exultantly wrote Franklin from Paris to\\nGeneral Washington, \"that no expedition was ever better planned or\\nbetter executed. It brightens the glory that must accompany your name to\\nthe latest posterity.\" Diplomacy as well as martial valor had its\\nreward.\\n\\n\\nPEACE AT LAST\\n\\n=British Opposition to the War.=--In measuring the forces that led to\\nthe final discomfiture of King George and Lord North, it is necessary to\\nremember that from the beginning to the end the British ministry at home\\nfaced a powerful, informed, and relentless opposition. There were\\nvigorous protests, first against the obnoxious acts which precipitated\\nthe unhappy quarrel, then against the way in which the war was waged,\\nand finally against the futile struggle to retain a hold upon the\\nAmerican dominions. Among the members of Parliament who thundered\\nagainst the government were the first statesmen and orators of the land.\\nWilliam Pitt, Earl of Chatham, though he deplored the idea of American\\nindependence, denounced the government as the aggressor and rejoiced in\\nAmerican resistance. Edmund Burke leveled his heavy batteries against\\nevery measure of coercion and at last strove for a peace which, while\\ngiving independence to America, would work for reconciliation rather\\nthan estrangement. Charles James Fox gave the colonies his generous\\nsympathy and warmly championed their rights. Outside of the circle of\\nstatesmen there were stout friends of the American cause like David\\nHume, the philosopher and historian, and Catherine Macaulay, an author\\nof wide fame and a republican bold enough to encourage Washington in\\nseeing it through.\\n\\nAgainst this powerful opposition, the government enlisted a whole army\\nof scribes and journalists to pour out criticism on the Americans and\\ntheir friends. Dr. Samuel Johnson, whom it employed in this business,\\nwas so savage that even the ministers had to tone down his pamphlets\\nbefore printing them. Far more weighty was Edward Gibbon, who was in\\ntime to win fame as the historian of the _Decline and Fall of the Roman\\nEmpire_. He had at first opposed the government; but, on being given a\\nlucrative post, he used his sharp pen in its support, causing his\\nfriends to ridicule him in these lines:\\n\\n    \"King George, in a fright\\n     Lest Gibbon should write\\n       The story of England\\'s disgrace,\\n     Thought no way so sure\\n     His pen to secure\\n       As to give the historian a place.\"\\n\\n=Lord North Yields.=--As time wore on, events bore heavily on the side\\nof the opponents of the government\\'s measures. They had predicted that\\nconquest was impossible, and they had urged the advantages of a peace\\nwhich would in some measure restore the affections of the Americans.\\nEvery day\\'s news confirmed their predictions and lent support to their\\narguments. Moreover, the war, which sprang out of an effort to relieve\\nEnglish burdens, made those burdens heavier than ever. Military expenses\\nwere daily increasing. Trade with the colonies, the greatest single\\noutlet for British goods and capital, was paralyzed. The heavy debts due\\nBritish merchants in America were not only unpaid but postponed into an\\nindefinite future. Ireland was on the verge of revolution. The French\\nhad a dangerous fleet on the high seas. In vain did the king assert in\\nDecember, 1781, that no difficulties would ever make him consent to a\\npeace that meant American independence. Parliament knew better, and on\\nFebruary 27, 1782, in the House of Commons was carried an address to the\\nthrone against continuing the war. Burke, Fox, the younger Pitt, Barre,\\nand other friends of the colonies voted in the affirmative. Lord North\\ngave notice then that his ministry was at an end. The king moaned:\\n\"Necessity made me yield.\"\\n\\nIn April, 1782, Franklin received word from the English government that\\nit was prepared to enter into negotiations leading to a settlement. This\\nwas embarrassing. In the treaty of alliance with France, the United\\nStates had promised that peace should be a joint affair agreed to by\\nboth nations in open conference. Finding France, however, opposed to\\nsome of their claims respecting boundaries and fisheries, the American\\ncommissioners conferred with the British agents at Paris without\\nconsulting the French minister. They actually signed a preliminary peace\\ndraft before they informed him of their operations. When Vergennes\\nreproached him, Franklin replied that they \"had been guilty of\\nneglecting _bienseance_ [good manners] but hoped that the great work\\nwould not be ruined by a single indiscretion.\"\\n\\n=The Terms of Peace (1783).=--The general settlement at Paris in 1783\\nwas a triumph for America. England recognized the independence of the\\nUnited States, naming each state specifically, and agreed to boundaries\\nextending from the Atlantic to the Mississippi and from the Great Lakes\\nto the Floridas. England held Canada, Newfoundland, and the West Indies\\nintact, made gains in India, and maintained her supremacy on the seas.\\nSpain won Florida and Minorca but not the coveted Gibraltar. France\\ngained nothing important save the satisfaction of seeing England humbled\\nand the colonies independent.\\n\\nThe generous terms secured by the American commission at Paris called\\nforth surprise and gratitude in the United States and smoothed the way\\nfor a renewal of commercial relations with the mother country. At the\\nsame time they gave genuine anxiety to European diplomats. \"This federal\\nrepublic is born a pigmy,\" wrote the Spanish ambassador to his royal\\nmaster. \"A day will come when it will be a giant; even a colossus\\nformidable to these countries. Liberty of conscience and the facility\\nfor establishing a new population on immense lands, as well as the\\nadvantages of the new government, will draw thither farmers and artisans\\nfrom all the nations. In a few years we shall watch with grief the\\ntyrannical existence of the same colossus.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: NORTH AMERICA ACCORDING TO THE TREATY OF 1783]\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD\\n\\nThe independence of the American colonies was foreseen by many European\\nstatesmen as they watched the growth of their population, wealth, and\\npower; but no one could fix the hour of the great event. Until 1763 the\\nAmerican colonists lived fairly happily under British dominion. There\\nwere collisions from time to time, of course. Royal governors clashed\\nwith stiff-necked colonial legislatures. There were protests against the\\nexercise of the king\\'s veto power in specific cases. Nevertheless, on\\nthe whole, the relations between America and the mother country were\\nmore amicable in 1763 than at any period under the Stuart regime which\\nclosed in 1688.\\n\\nThe crash, when it came, was not deliberately willed by any one. It was\\nthe product of a number of forces that happened to converge about 1763.\\nThree years before, there had come to the throne George III, a young,\\nproud, inexperienced, and stubborn king. For nearly fifty years his\\npredecessors, Germans as they were in language and interest, had allowed\\nthings to drift in England and America. George III decided that he would\\nbe king in fact as well as in name. About the same time England brought\\nto a close the long and costly French and Indian War and was staggering\\nunder a heavy burden of debt and taxes. The war had been fought partly\\nin defense of the American colonies and nothing seemed more reasonable\\nto English statesmen than the idea that the colonies should bear part of\\nthe cost of their own defense. At this juncture there came into\\nprominence, in royal councils, two men bent on taxing America and\\ncontrolling her trade, Grenville and Townshend. The king was willing,\\nthe English taxpayers were thankful for any promise of relief, and\\nstatesmen were found to undertake the experiment. England therefore set\\nout upon a new course. She imposed taxes upon the colonists, regulated\\ntheir trade and set royal officers upon them to enforce the law. This\\naction evoked protests from the colonists. They held a Stamp Act\\nCongress to declare their rights and petition for a redress of\\ngrievances. Some of the more restless spirits rioted in the streets,\\nsacked the houses of the king\\'s officers, and tore up the stamped paper.\\n\\nFrightened by uprising, the English government drew back and repealed\\nthe Stamp Act. Then it veered again and renewed its policy of\\ninterference. Interference again called forth American protests.\\nProtests aroused sharper retaliation. More British regulars were sent\\nover to keep order. More irritating laws were passed by Parliament.\\nRioting again appeared: tea was dumped in the harbor of Boston and\\nseized in the harbor of Charleston. The British answer was more force.\\nThe response of the colonists was a Continental Congress for defense. An\\nunexpected and unintended clash of arms at Lexington and Concord in the\\nspring of 1775 brought forth from the king of England a proclamation:\\n\"The Americans are rebels!\"\\n\\nThe die was cast. The American Revolution had begun. Washington was made\\ncommander-in-chief. Armies were raised, money was borrowed, a huge\\nvolume of paper currency was issued, and foreign aid was summoned.\\nFranklin plied his diplomatic arts at Paris until in 1778 he induced\\nFrance to throw her sword into the balance. Three years later,\\nCornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. In 1783, by the formal treaty of\\npeace, George III acknowledged the independence of the United States.\\nThe new nation, endowed with an imperial domain stretching from the\\nAtlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River, began its career among the\\nsovereign powers of the earth.\\n\\nIn the sphere of civil government, the results of the Revolution were\\nequally remarkable. Royal officers and royal authorities were driven\\nfrom the former dominions. All power was declared to be in the people.\\nAll the colonies became states, each with its own constitution or plan\\nof government. The thirteen states were united in common bonds under the\\nArticles of Confederation. A republic on a large scale was instituted.\\nThus there was begun an adventure in popular government such as the\\nworld had never seen. Could it succeed or was it destined to break down\\nand be supplanted by a monarchy? The fate of whole continents hung upon\\nthe answer.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nJ.

THE UNION AND NATIONAL POLITICS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nTHE FORMATION OF THE CONSTITUTION\\n\\n\\nTHE PROMISE AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF AMERICA\\n\\nThe rise of a young republic composed of thirteen states, each governed\\nby officials popularly elected under constitutions drafted by \"the plain\\npeople,\" was the most significant feature of the eighteenth century. The\\nmajority of the patriots whose labors and sacrifices had made this\\npossible naturally looked upon their work and pronounced it good. Those\\nAmericans, however, who peered beneath the surface of things, saw that\\nthe Declaration of Independence, even if splendidly phrased, and paper\\nconstitutions, drawn by finest enthusiasm \"uninstructed by experience,\"\\ncould not alone make the republic great and prosperous or even free. All\\naround them they saw chaos in finance and in industry and perils for the\\nimmediate future.\\n\\n=The Weakness of the Articles of Confederation.=--The government under\\nthe Articles of Confederation had neither the strength nor the resources\\nnecessary to cope with the problems of reconstruction left by the war.\\nThe sole organ of government was a Congress composed of from two to\\nseven members from each state chosen as the legislature might direct and\\npaid by the state. In determining all questions, each state had one\\nvote--Delaware thus enjoying the same weight as Virginia. There was no\\npresident to enforce the laws. Congress was given power to select a\\ncommittee of thirteen--one from each state--to act as an executive body\\nwhen it was not in session; but this device, on being tried out, proved\\na failure. There was no system of national courts to which citizens and\\nstates could appeal for the protection of their rights or through which\\nthey could compel obedience to law. The two great powers of government,\\nmilitary and financial, were withheld. Congress, it is true, could\\nauthorize expenditures but had to rely upon the states for the payment\\nof contributions to meet its bills. It could also order the\\nestablishment of an army, but it could only request the states to supply\\ntheir respective quotas of soldiers. It could not lay taxes nor bring\\nany pressure to bear upon a single citizen in the whole country. It\\ncould act only through the medium of the state governments.\\n\\n=Financial and Commercial Disorders.=--In the field of public finance,\\nthe disorders were pronounced. The huge debt incurred during the war was\\nstill outstanding. Congress was unable to pay either the interest or the\\nprincipal. Public creditors were in despair, as the market value of\\ntheir bonds sank to twenty-five or even ten cents on the dollar. The\\ncurrent bills of Congress were unpaid. As some one complained, there was\\nnot enough money in the treasury to buy pen and ink with which to record\\nthe transactions of the shadow legislature. The currency was in utter\\nchaos. Millions of dollars in notes issued by Congress had become mere\\ntrash worth a cent or two on the dollar. There was no other expression\\nof contempt so forceful as the popular saying: \"not worth a\\nContinental.\" To make matters worse, several of the states were pouring\\nnew streams of paper money from the press. Almost the only good money in\\ncirculation consisted of English, French, and Spanish coins, and the\\npublic was even defrauded by them because money changers were busy\\nclipping and filing away the metal. Foreign commerce was unsettled. The\\nentire British system of trade discrimination was turned against the\\nAmericans, and Congress, having no power to regulate foreign commerce,\\nwas unable to retaliate or to negotiate treaties which it could enforce.\\nDomestic commerce was impeded by the jealousies of the states, which\\nerected tariff barriers against their neighbors. The condition of the\\ncurrency made the exchange of money and goods extremely difficult, and,\\nas if to increase the confusion, backward states enacted laws hindering\\nthe prompt collection of debts within their borders--an evil which\\nnothing but a national system of courts could cure.\\n\\n=Congress in Disrepute.=--With treaties set at naught by the states, the\\nlaws unenforced, the treasury empty, and the public credit gone, the\\nCongress of the United States fell into utter disrepute. It called upon\\nthe states to pay their quotas of money into the treasury, only to be\\ntreated with contempt. Even its own members looked upon it as a solemn\\nfutility. Some of the ablest men refused to accept election to it, and\\nmany who did take the doubtful honor failed to attend the sessions.\\nAgain and again it was impossible to secure a quorum for the transaction\\nof business.\\n\\n=Troubles of the State Governments.=--The state governments, free to\\npursue their own course with no interference from without, had almost as\\nmany difficulties as the Congress. They too were loaded with\\nrevolutionary debts calling for heavy taxes upon an already restive\\npopulation. Oppressed by their financial burdens and discouraged by the\\nfall in prices which followed the return of peace, the farmers of\\nseveral states joined in a concerted effort and compelled their\\nlegislatures to issue large sums of paper money. The currency fell in\\nvalue, but nevertheless it was forced on unwilling creditors to square\\nold accounts.\\n\\nIn every part of the country legislative action fluctuated violently.\\nLaws were made one year only to be repealed the next and reenacted the\\nthird year. Lands were sold by one legislature and the sales were\\ncanceled by its successor. Uncertainty and distrust were the natural\\nconsequences. Men of substance longed for some power that would forbid\\nstates to issue bills of credit, to make paper money legal tender in\\npayment of debts, or to impair the obligation of contracts. Men heavily\\nin debt, on the other hand, urged even more drastic action against\\ncreditors.\\n\\nSo great did the discontent of the farmers in New Hampshire become in\\n1786 that a mob surrounded the legislature, demanding a repeal of the\\ntaxes and the issuance of paper money. It was with difficulty that an\\narmed rebellion was avoided. In Massachusetts the malcontents, under the\\nleadership of Daniel Shays, a captain in the Revolutionary army,\\norganized that same year open resistance to the government of the state.\\nShays and his followers protested against the conduct of creditors in\\nforeclosing mortgages upon the debt-burdened farmers, against the\\nlawyers for increasing the costs of legal proceedings, against the\\nsenate of the state the members of which were apportioned among the\\ntowns on the basis of the amount of taxes paid, against heavy taxes, and\\nagainst the refusal of the legislature to issue paper money. They seized\\nthe towns of Worcester and Springfield and broke up the courts of\\njustice. All through the western part of the state the revolt spread,\\nsending a shock of alarm to every center and section of the young\\nrepublic. Only by the most vigorous action was Governor Bowdoin able to\\nquell the uprising; and when that task was accomplished, the state\\ngovernment did not dare to execute any of the prisoners because they had\\nso many sympathizers. Moreover, Bowdoin and several members of the\\nlegislature who had been most zealous in their attacks on the insurgents\\nwere defeated at the ensuing election. The need of national assistance\\nfor state governments in times of domestic violence was everywhere\\nemphasized by men who were opposed to revolutionary acts.\\n\\n=Alarm over Dangers to the Republic.=--Leading American citizens,\\nwatching the drift of affairs, were slowly driven to the conclusion that\\nthe new ship of state so proudly launched a few years before was\\ncareening into anarchy. \"The facts of our peace and independence,\" wrote\\na friend of Washington, \"do not at present wear so promising an\\nappearance as I had fondly painted in my mind. The prejudices,\\njealousies, and turbulence of the people at times almost stagger my\\nconfidence in our political establishments; and almost occasion me to\\nthink that they will show themselves unworthy of the noble prize for\\nwhich we have contended.\"\\n\\nWashington himself was profoundly discouraged. On hearing of Shays\\'s\\nrebellion, he exclaimed: \"What, gracious God, is man that there should\\nbe such inconsistency and perfidiousness in his conduct! It is but the\\nother day that we were shedding our blood to obtain the constitutions\\nunder which we now live--constitutions of our own choice and making--and\\nnow we are unsheathing our sword to overturn them.\" The same year he\\nburst out in a lament over rumors of restoring royal government. \"I am\\ntold that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical government\\nwithout horror. From thinking proceeds speaking. Hence to acting is\\noften but a single step. But how irresistible and tremendous! What a\\ntriumph for our enemies to verify their predictions! What a triumph for\\nthe advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing\\nourselves!\"\\n\\n=Congress Attempts Some Reforms.=--The Congress was not indifferent to\\nthe events that disturbed Washington. On the contrary it put forth many\\nefforts to check tendencies so dangerous to finance, commerce,\\nindustries, and the Confederation itself. In 1781, even before the\\ntreaty of peace was signed, the Congress, having found out how futile\\nwere its taxing powers, carried a resolution of amendment to the\\nArticles of Confederation, authorizing the levy of a moderate duty on\\nimports. Yet this mild measure was rejected by the states. Two years\\nlater the Congress prepared another amendment sanctioning the levy of\\nduties on imports, to be collected this time by state officers and\\napplied to the payment of the public debt. This more limited proposal,\\ndesigned to save public credit, likewise failed. In 1786, the Congress\\nmade a third appeal to the states for help, declaring that they had been\\nso irregular and so negligent in paying their quotas that further\\nreliance upon that mode of raising revenues was dishonorable and\\ndangerous.\\n\\n\\nTHE CALLING OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION\\n\\n=Hamilton and Washington Urge Reform.=--The attempts at reform by the\\nCongress were accompanied by demand for, both within and without that\\nbody, a convention to frame a new plan of government. In 1780, the\\nyouthful Alexander Hamilton, realizing the weakness of the Articles, so\\nwidely discussed, proposed a general convention for the purpose of\\ndrafting a new constitution on entirely different principles. With\\ntireless energy he strove to bring his countrymen to his view.\\nWashington, agreeing with him on every point, declared, in a circular\\nletter to the governors, that the duration of the union would be short\\nunless there was lodged somewhere a supreme power \"to regulate and\\ngovern the general concerns of the confederated republic.\" The governor\\nof Massachusetts, disturbed by the growth of discontent all about him,\\nsuggested to the state legislature in 1785 the advisability of a\\nnational convention to enlarge the powers of the Congress. The\\nlegislature approved the plan, but did not press it to a conclusion.\\n\\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER HAMILTON]\\n\\n=The Annapolis Convention.=--Action finally came from the South. The\\nVirginia legislature, taking things into its own hands, called a\\nconference of delegates at Annapolis to consider matters of taxation and\\ncommerce. When the convention assembled in 1786, it was found that only\\nfive states had taken the trouble to send representatives. The leaders\\nwere deeply discouraged, but the resourceful Hamilton, a delegate from\\nNew York, turned the affair to good account. He secured the adoption of\\na resolution, calling upon the Congress itself to summon another\\nconvention, to meet at Philadelphia.\\n\\n=A National Convention Called (1787).=--The Congress, as tardy as ever,\\nat last decided in February, 1787, to issue the call. Fearing drastic\\nchanges, however, it restricted the convention to \"the sole and express\\npurpose of revising the Articles of Confederation.\" Jealous of its own\\npowers, it added that any alterations proposed should be referred to the\\nCongress and the states for their approval.\\n\\nEvery state in the union, except Rhode Island, responded to this call.\\nIndeed some of the states, having the Annapolis resolution before them,\\nhad already anticipated the Congress by selecting delegates before the\\nformal summons came. Thus, by the persistence of governors,\\nlegislatures, and private citizens, there was brought about the\\nlong-desired national convention. In May, 1787, it assembled in\\nPhiladelphia.\\n\\n=The Eminent Men of the Convention.=--On the roll of that memorable\\nconvention were fifty-five men, at least half of whom were acknowledged\\nto be among the foremost statesmen and thinkers in America. Every field\\nof statecraft was represented by them: war and practical management in\\nWashington, who was chosen president of the convention; diplomacy in\\nFranklin, now old and full of honor in his own land as well as abroad;\\nfinance in Alexander Hamilton and Robert Morris; law in James Wilson of\\nPennsylvania; the philosophy of government in James Madison, called the\\n\"father of the Constitution.\" They were not theorists but practical men,\\nrich in political experience and endowed with deep insight into the\\nsprings of human action. Three of them had served in the Stamp Act\\nCongress: Dickinson of Delaware, William Samuel Johnson of Connecticut,\\nand John Rutledge of South Carolina. Eight had been signers of the\\nDeclaration of Independence: Read of Delaware, Sherman of Connecticut,\\nWythe of Virginia, Gerry of Massachusetts, Franklin, Robert Morris,\\nGeorge Clymer, and James Wilson of Pennsylvania. All but twelve had at\\nsome time served in the Continental Congress and eighteen were members\\nof that body in the spring of 1787. Washington, Hamilton, Mifflin, and\\nCharles Pinckney had been officers in the Revolutionary army. Seven of\\nthe delegates had gained political experience as governors of states.\\n\"The convention as a whole,\" according to the historian Hildreth,\\n\"represented in a marked manner the talent, intelligence, and\\nespecially the conservative sentiment of the country.\"\\n\\n\\nTHE FRAMING OF THE CONSTITUTION\\n\\n=Problems Involved.=--The great problems before the convention were nine\\nin number: (1) Shall the Articles of Confederation be revised or a new\\nsystem of government constructed? (2) Shall the government be founded on\\nstates equal in power as under the Articles or on the broader and deeper\\nfoundation of population? (3) What direct share shall the people have in\\nthe election of national officers? (4) What shall be the qualifications\\nfor the suffrage? (5) How shall the conflicting interests of the\\ncommercial and the planting states be balanced so as to safeguard the\\nessential rights of each? (6) What shall be the form of the new\\ngovernment? (7) What powers shall be conferred on it? (8) How shall the\\nstate legislatures be restrained from their attacks on property rights\\nsuch as the issuance of paper money? (9) Shall the approval of all the\\nstates be necessary, as under the Articles, for the adoption and\\namendment of the Constitution?\\n\\n=Revision of the Articles or a New Government?=--The moment the first\\nproblem was raised, representatives of the small states, led by William\\nPaterson of New Jersey, were on their feet. They feared that, if the\\nArticles were overthrown, the equality and rights of the states would be\\nput in jeopardy. Their protest was therefore vigorous. They cited the\\ncall issued by the Congress in summoning the convention which\\nspecifically stated that they were assembled for \"the sole and express\\npurpose of revising the Articles of Confederation.\" They cited also\\ntheir instructions from their state legislatures, which authorized them\\nto \"revise and amend\" the existing scheme of government, not to make a\\nrevolution in it. To depart from the authorization laid down by the\\nCongress and the legislatures would be to exceed their powers, they\\nargued, and to betray the trust reposed in them by their countrymen.\\n\\nTo their contentions, Randolph of Virginia replied: \"When the salvation\\nof the republic is at stake, it would be treason to our trust not to\\npropose what we find necessary.\" Hamilton, reminding the delegates that\\ntheir work was still subject to the approval of the states, frankly said\\nthat on the point of their powers he had no scruples. With the issue\\nclear, the convention cast aside the Articles as if they did not exist\\nand proceeded to the work of drawing up a new constitution, \"laying its\\nfoundations on such principles and organizing its powers in such form\"\\nas to the delegates seemed \"most likely to affect their safety and\\nhappiness.\"\\n\\n=A Government Founded on States or on People?--The\\nCompromise.=--Defeated in their attempt to limit the convention to a\\nmere revision of the Articles, the spokesmen of the smaller states\\nredoubled their efforts to preserve the equality of the states. The\\nsignal for a radical departure from the Articles on this point was given\\nearly in the sessions when Randolph presented \"the Virginia plan.\" He\\nproposed that the new national legislature consist of two houses, the\\nmembers of which were to be apportioned among the states according to\\ntheir wealth or free white population, as the convention might decide.\\nThis plan was vehemently challenged. Paterson of New Jersey flatly\\navowed that neither he nor his state would ever bow to such tyranny. As\\nan alternative, he presented \"the New Jersey plan\" calling for a\\nnational legislature of one house representing states as such, not\\nwealth or people--a legislature in which all states, large or small,\\nwould have equal voice. Wilson of Pennsylvania, on behalf of the more\\npopulous states, took up the gauntlet which Paterson had thrown down. It\\nwas absurd, he urged, for 180,000 men in one state to have the same\\nweight in national counsels as 750,000 men in another state. \"The\\ngentleman from New Jersey,\" he said, \"is candid. He declares his opinion\\nboldly.... I will be equally candid.... I will never confederate on his\\nprinciples.\" So the bitter controversy ran on through many exciting\\nsessions.\\n\\nGreek had met Greek. The convention was hopelessly deadlocked and on the\\nverge of dissolution, \"scarce held together by the strength of a hair,\"\\nas one of the delegates remarked. A crash was averted only by a\\ncompromise. Instead of a Congress of one house as provided by the\\nArticles, the convention agreed upon a legislature of two houses. In the\\nSenate, the aspirations of the small states were to be satisfied, for\\neach state was given two members in that body. In the formation of the\\nHouse of Representatives, the larger states were placated, for it was\\nagreed that the members of that chamber were to be apportioned among the\\nstates on the basis of population, counting three-fifths of the slaves.\\n\\n=The Question of Popular Election.=--The method of selecting federal\\nofficers and members of Congress also produced an acrimonious debate\\nwhich revealed how deep-seated was the distrust of the capacity of the\\npeople to govern themselves. Few there were who believed that no branch\\nof the government should be elected directly by the voters; still fewer\\nwere there, however, who desired to see all branches so chosen. One or\\ntwo even expressed a desire for a monarchy. The dangers of democracy\\nwere stressed by Gerry of Massachusetts: \"All the evils we experience\\nflow from an excess of democracy. The people do not want virtue but are\\nthe dupes of pretended patriots.... I have been too republican\\nheretofore but have been taught by experience the danger of a leveling\\nspirit.\" To the \"democratic licentiousness of the state legislatures,\"\\nRandolph sought to oppose a \"firm senate.\" To check the excesses of\\npopular government Charles Pinckney of South Carolina declared that no\\none should be elected President who was not worth $100,000 and that high\\nproperty qualifications should be placed on members of Congress and\\njudges. Other members of the convention were stoutly opposed to such\\n\"high-toned notions of government.\" Franklin and Wilson, both from\\nPennsylvania, vigorously championed popular election; while men like\\nMadison insisted that at least one part of the government should rest on\\nthe broad foundation of the people.\\n\\nOut of this clash of opinion also came compromise. One branch, the House\\nof Representatives, it was agreed, was to be elected directly by the\\nvoters, while the Senators were to be elected indirectly by the state\\nlegislatures. The President was to be chosen by electors selected as the\\nlegislatures of the states might determine, and the judges of the\\nfederal courts, supreme and inferior, by the President and the Senate.\\n\\n=The Question of the Suffrage.=--The battle over the suffrage was sharp\\nbut brief. Gouverneur Morris proposed that only land owners should be\\npermitted to vote. Madison replied that the state legislatures, which\\nhad made so much trouble with radical laws, were elected by freeholders.\\nAfter the debate, the delegates, unable to agree on any property\\nlimitations on the suffrage, decided that the House of Representatives\\nshould be elected by voters having the \"qualifications requisite for\\nelectors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature.\" Thus\\nthey accepted the suffrage provisions of the states.\\n\\n=The Balance between the Planting and the Commercial States.=--After the\\ndebates had gone on for a few weeks, Madison came to the conclusion that\\nthe real division in the convention was not between the large and the\\nsmall states but between the planting section founded on slave labor and\\nthe commercial North. Thus he anticipated by nearly three-quarters of a\\ncentury \"the irrepressible conflict.\" The planting states had neither\\nthe free white population nor the wealth of the North. There were,\\ncounting Delaware, six of them as against seven commercial states.\\nDependent for their prosperity mainly upon the sale of tobacco, rice,\\nand other staples abroad, they feared that Congress might impose\\nrestraints upon their enterprise. Being weaker in numbers, they were\\nafraid that the majority might lay an unfair burden of taxes upon them.\\n\\n_Representation and Taxation._--The Southern members of the convention\\nwere therefore very anxious to secure for their section the largest\\npossible representation in Congress, and at the same time to restrain\\nthe taxing power of that body. Two devices were thought adapted to these\\nends. One was to count the slaves as people when apportioning\\nrepresentatives among the states according to their respective\\npopulations; the other was to provide that direct taxes should be\\napportioned among the states, in proportion not to their wealth but to\\nthe number of their free white inhabitants. For obvious reasons the\\nNorthern delegates objected to these proposals. Once more a compromise\\nproved to be the solution. It was agreed that not all the slaves but\\nthree-fifths of them should be counted for both purposes--representation\\nand direct taxation.\\n\\n_Commerce and the Slave Trade._--Southern interests were also involved\\nin the project to confer upon Congress the power to regulate interstate\\nand foreign commerce. To the manufacturing and trading states this was\\nessential. It would prevent interstate tariffs and trade jealousies; it\\nwould enable Congress to protect American manufactures and to break\\ndown, by appropriate retaliations, foreign discriminations against\\nAmerican commerce. To the South the proposal was menacing because\\ntariffs might interfere with the free exchange of the produce of\\nplantations in European markets, and navigation acts might confine the\\ncarrying trade to American, that is Northern, ships. The importation of\\nslaves, moreover, it was feared might be heavily taxed or immediately\\nprohibited altogether.\\n\\nThe result of this and related controversies was a debate on the merits\\nof slavery. Gouverneur Morris delivered his mind and heart on that\\nsubject, denouncing slavery as a nefarious institution and the curse of\\nheaven on the states in which it prevailed. Mason of Virginia, a\\nslaveholder himself, was hardly less outspoken, saying: \"Slavery\\ndiscourages arts and manufactures. The poor despise labor when performed\\nby slaves. They prevent the migration of whites who really strengthen\\nand enrich a country.\"\\n\\nThe system, however, had its defenders. Representatives from South\\nCarolina argued that their entire economic life rested on slave labor\\nand that the high death rate in the rice swamps made continuous\\nimportation necessary. Ellsworth of Connecticut took the ground that\\nthe convention should not meddle with slavery. \"The morality or wisdom\\nof slavery,\" he said, \"are considerations belonging to the states. What\\nenriches a part enriches the whole.\" To the future he turned an\\nuntroubled face: \"As population increases, poor laborers will be so\\nplenty as to render slaves useless. Slavery in time will not be a speck\\nin our country.\" Virginia and North Carolina, already overstocked with\\nslaves, favored prohibiting the traffic in them; but South Carolina was\\nadamant. She must have fresh supplies of slaves or she would not\\nfederate.\\n\\nSo it was agreed that, while Congress might regulate foreign trade by\\nmajority vote, the importation of slaves should not be forbidden before\\nthe lapse of twenty years, and that any import tax should not exceed $10\\na head. At the same time, in connection with the regulation of foreign\\ntrade, it was stipulated that a two-thirds vote in the Senate should be\\nnecessary in the ratification of treaties. A further concession to the\\nSouth was made in the provision for the return of runaway slaves--a\\nprovision also useful in the North, where indentured servants were about\\nas troublesome as slaves in escaping from their masters.\\n\\n=The Form of the Government.=--As to the details of the frame of\\ngovernment and the grand principles involved, the opinion of the\\nconvention ebbed and flowed, decisions being taken in the heat of\\ndebate, only to be revoked and taken again.\\n\\n_The Executive._--There was general agreement that there should be an\\nexecutive branch; for reliance upon Congress to enforce its own laws and\\ntreaties had been a broken reed. On the character and functions of the\\nexecutive, however, there were many views. The New Jersey plan called\\nfor a council selected by the Congress; the Virginia plan provided that\\nthe executive branch should be chosen by the Congress but did not state\\nwhether it should be composed of one or several persons. On this matter\\nthe convention voted first one way and then another; finally it agreed\\non a single executive chosen indirectly by electors selected as the\\nstate legislatures might decide, serving for four years, subject to\\nimpeachment, and endowed with regal powers in the command of the army\\nand the navy and in the enforcement of the laws.\\n\\n_The Legislative Branch--Congress._--After the convention had made the\\ngreat compromise between the large and small commonwealths by giving\\nrepresentation to states in the Senate and to population in the House,\\nthe question of methods of election had to be decided. As to the House\\nof Representatives it was readily agreed that the members should be\\nelected by direct popular vote. There was also easy agreement on the\\nproposition that a strong Senate was needed to check the \"turbulence\" of\\nthe lower house. Four devices were finally selected to accomplish this\\npurpose. In the first place, the Senators were not to be chosen directly\\nby the voters but by the legislatures of the states, thus removing their\\nelection one degree from the populace. In the second place, their term\\nwas fixed at six years instead of two, as in the case of the House. In\\nthe third place, provision was made for continuity by having only\\none-third of the members go out at a time while two-thirds remained in\\nservice. Finally, it was provided that Senators must be at least thirty\\nyears old while Representatives need be only twenty-five.\\n\\n_The Judiciary._--The need for federal courts to carry out the law was\\nhardly open to debate. The feebleness of the Articles of Confederation\\nwas, in a large measure, attributed to the want of a judiciary to hold\\nstates and individuals in obedience to the laws and treaties of the\\nunion. Nevertheless on this point the advocates of states\\' rights were\\nextremely sensitive. They looked with distrust upon judges appointed at\\nthe national capital and emancipated from local interests and\\ntraditions; they remembered with what insistence they had claimed\\nagainst Britain the right of local trial by jury and with what\\nconsternation they had viewed the proposal to make colonial judges\\nindependent of the assemblies in the matter of their salaries.\\nReluctantly they yielded to the demand for federal courts, consenting at\\nfirst only to a supreme court to review cases heard in lower state\\ncourts and finally to such additional inferior courts as Congress might\\ndeem necessary.\\n\\n_The System of Checks and Balances._--It is thus apparent that the\\nframers of the Constitution, in shaping the form of government, arranged\\nfor a distribution of power among three branches, executive,\\nlegislative, and judicial. Strictly speaking we might say four branches,\\nfor the legislature, or Congress, was composed of two houses, elected in\\ndifferent ways, and one of them, the Senate, was made a check on the\\nPresident through its power of ratifying treaties and appointments. \"The\\naccumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judicial, in the\\nsame hands,\" wrote Madison, \"whether of one, a few, or many, and whether\\nhereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the\\nvery definition of tyranny.\" The devices which the convention adopted to\\nprevent such a centralization of authority were exceedingly ingenious\\nand well calculated to accomplish the purposes of the authors.\\n\\nThe legislature consisted of two houses, the members of which were to be\\napportioned on a different basis, elected in different ways, and to\\nserve for different terms. A veto on all its acts was vested in a\\nPresident elected in a manner not employed in the choice of either\\nbranch of the legislature, serving for four years, and subject to\\nremoval only by the difficult process of impeachment. After a law had\\nrun the gantlet of both houses and the executive, it was subject to\\ninterpretation and annulment by the judiciary, appointed by the\\nPresident with the consent of the Senate and serving for life. Thus it\\nwas made almost impossible for any political party to get possession of\\nall branches of the government at a single popular election. As Hamilton\\nremarked, the friends of good government considered \"every institution\\ncalculated to restrain the excess of law making and to keep things in\\nthe same state in which they happen to be at any given period as more\\nlikely to do good than harm.\"\\n\\n=The Powers of the Federal Government.=--On the question of the powers\\nto be conferred upon the new government there was less occasion for a\\nserious dispute. Even the delegates from the small states agreed with\\nthose from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia that new powers\\nshould be added to those intrusted to Congress by the Articles of\\nConfederation. The New Jersey plan as well as the Virginia plan\\nrecognized this fact. Some of the delegates, like Hamilton and Madison,\\neven proposed to give Congress a general legislative authority covering\\nall national matters; but others, frightened by the specter of\\nnationalism, insisted on specifying each power to be conferred and\\nfinally carried the day.\\n\\n_Taxation and Commerce._--There were none bold enough to dissent from\\nthe proposition that revenue must be provided to pay current expenses\\nand discharge the public debt. When once the dispute over the\\napportionment of direct taxes among the slave states was settled, it was\\nan easy matter to decide that Congress should have power to lay and\\ncollect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises. In this way the national\\ngovernment was freed from dependence upon stubborn and tardy\\nlegislatures and enabled to collect funds directly from citizens. There\\nwere likewise none bold enough to contend that the anarchy of state\\ntariffs and trade discriminations should be longer endured. When the\\nfears of the planting states were allayed and the \"bargain\" over the\\nimportation of slaves was reached, the convention vested in Congress the\\npower to regulate foreign and interstate commerce.\\n\\n_National Defense._--The necessity for national defense was realized,\\nthough the fear of huge military establishments was equally present. The\\nold practice of relying on quotas furnished by the state legislatures\\nwas completely discredited. As in the case of taxes a direct authority\\nover citizens was demanded. Congress was therefore given full power to\\nraise and support armies and a navy. It could employ the state militia\\nwhen desirable; but it could at the same time maintain a regular army\\nand call directly upon all able-bodied males if the nature of a crisis\\nwas thought to require it.\\n\\n_The \"Necessary and Proper\" Clause._--To the specified power vested in\\nCongress by the Constitution, the advocates of a strong national\\ngovernment added a general clause authorizing it to make all laws\\n\"necessary and proper\" for carrying into effect any and all of the\\nenumerated powers. This clause, interpreted by that master mind, Chief\\nJustice Marshall, was later construed to confer powers as wide as the\\nrequirements of a vast country spanning a continent and taking its place\\namong the mighty nations of the earth.\\n\\n=Restraints on the States.=--Framing a government and endowing it with\\nlarge powers were by no means the sole concern of the convention. Its\\nvery existence had been due quite as much to the conduct of the state\\nlegislatures as to the futilities of a paralyzed Continental Congress.\\nIn every state, explains Marshall in his _Life of Washington_, there was\\na party of men who had \"marked out for themselves a more indulgent\\ncourse. Viewing with extreme tenderness the case of the debtor, their\\nefforts were unceasingly directed to his relief. To exact a faithful\\ncompliance with contracts was, in their opinion, a harsh measure which\\nthe people could not bear. They were uniformly in favor of relaxing the\\nadministration of justice, of affording facilities for the payment of\\ndebts, or of suspending their collection, and remitting taxes.\"\\n\\nThe legislatures under the dominance of these men had enacted paper\\nmoney laws enabling debtors to discharge their obligations more easily.\\nThe convention put an end to such practices by providing that no state\\nshould emit bills of credit or make anything but gold or silver legal\\ntender in the payment of debts. The state legislatures had enacted laws\\nallowing men to pay their debts by turning over to creditors land or\\npersonal property; they had repealed the charter of an endowed college\\nand taken the management from the hands of the lawful trustees; and they\\nhad otherwise interfered with the enforcement of private agreements. The\\nconvention, taking notice of such matters, inserted a clause forbidding\\nstates \"to impair the obligation of contracts.\" The more venturous of\\nthe radicals had in Massachusetts raised the standard of revolt against\\nthe authorities of the state. The convention answered by a brief\\nsentence to the effect that the President of the United States, to be\\nequipped with a regular army, would send troops to suppress domestic\\ninsurrections whenever called upon by the legislature or, if it was not\\nin session, by the governor of the state. To make sure that the\\nrestrictions on the states would not be dead letters, the federal\\nConstitution, laws, and treaties were made the supreme law of the land,\\nto be enforced whenever necessary by a national judiciary and executive\\nagainst violations on the part of any state authorities.\\n\\n=Provisions for Ratification and Amendment.=--When the frame of\\ngovernment had been determined, the powers to be vested in it had been\\nenumerated, and the restrictions upon the states had been written into\\nthe bond, there remained three final questions. How shall the\\nConstitution be ratified? What number of states shall be necessary to\\nput it into effect? How shall it be amended in the future?\\n\\nOn the first point, the mandate under which the convention was sitting\\nseemed positive. The Articles of Confederation were still in effect.\\nThey provided that amendments could be made only by unanimous adoption\\nin Congress and the approval of all the states. As if to give force to\\nthis provision of law, the call for the convention had expressly stated\\nthat all alterations and revisions should be reported to Congress for\\nadoption or rejection, Congress itself to transmit the document\\nthereafter to the states for their review.\\n\\nTo have observed the strict letter of the law would have defeated the\\npurposes of the delegates, because Congress and the state legislatures\\nwere openly hostile to such drastic changes as had been made. Unanimous\\nratification, as events proved, would have been impossible. Therefore\\nthe delegates decided that the Constitution should be sent to Congress\\nwith the recommendation that it, in turn, transmit the document, not to\\nthe state legislatures, but to conventions held in the states for the\\nspecial object of deciding upon ratification. This process was followed.\\nIt was their belief that special conventions would be more friendly than\\nthe state legislatures.\\n\\nThe convention was equally positive in dealing with the problem of the\\nnumber of states necessary to establish the new Constitution. Attempts\\nto change the Articles had failed because amendment required the\\napproval of every state and there was always at least one recalcitrant\\nmember of the union. The opposition to a new Constitution was\\nundoubtedly formidable. Rhode Island had even refused to take part in\\nframing it, and her hostility was deep and open. So the convention cast\\naside the provision of the Articles of Confederation which required\\nunanimous approval for any change in the plan of government; it decreed\\nthat the new Constitution should go into effect when ratified by nine\\nstates.\\n\\nIn providing for future changes in the Constitution itself the\\nconvention also thrust aside the old rule of unanimous approval, and\\ndecided that an amendment could be made on a two-thirds vote in both\\nhouses of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states. This\\nchange was of profound significance. Every state agreed to be bound in\\nthe future by amendments duly adopted even in case it did not approve\\nthem itself. America in this way set out upon the high road that led\\nfrom a league of states to a nation.\\n\\n\\nTHE STRUGGLE OVER RATIFICATION\\n\\nOn September 17, 1787, the Constitution, having been finally drafted in\\nclear and simple language, a model to all makers of fundamental law, was\\nadopted. The convention, after nearly four months of debate in secret\\nsession, flung open the doors and presented to the Americans the\\nfinished plan for the new government. Then the great debate passed to\\nthe people.\\n\\n=The Opposition.=--Storms of criticism at once descended upon the\\nConstitution. \"Fraudulent usurpation!\" exclaimed Gerry, who had refused\\nto sign it. \"A monster\" out of the \"thick veil of secrecy,\" declaimed a\\nPennsylvania newspaper. \"An iron-handed despotism will be the result,\"\\nprotested a third. \"We, \\'the low-born,\\'\" sarcastically wrote a fourth,\\n\"will now admit the \\'six hundred well-born\\' immediately to establish\\nthis most noble, most excellent, and truly divine constitution.\" The\\nPresident will become a king; Congress will be as tyrannical as\\nParliament in the old days; the states will be swallowed up; the rights\\nof the people will be trampled upon; the poor man\\'s justice will be lost\\nin the endless delays of the federal courts--such was the strain of the\\nprotests against ratification.\\n\\n[Illustration: AN ADVERTISEMENT OF _The Federalist_]\\n\\n=Defense of the Constitution.=--Moved by the tempest of opposition,\\nHamilton, Madison, and Jay took up their pens in defense of the\\nConstitution. In a series of newspaper articles they discussed and\\nexpounded with eloquence, learning, and dignity every important clause\\nand provision of the proposed plan. These papers, afterwards collected\\nand published in a volume known as _The Federalist_, form the finest\\ntextbook on the Constitution that has ever been printed. It takes its\\nplace, moreover, among the wisest and weightiest treatises on government\\never written in any language in any time. Other men, not so gifted, were\\nno less earnest in their support of ratification. In private\\ncorrespondence, editorials, pamphlets, and letters to the newspapers,\\nthey urged their countrymen to forget their partisanship and accept a\\nConstitution which, in spite of any defects great or small, was the\\nonly guarantee against dissolution and warfare at home and dishonor and\\nweakness abroad.\\n\\n[Illustration: CELEBRATING THE RATIFICATION]\\n\\n=The Action of the State Conventions.=--Before the end of the year,\\n1787, three states had ratified the Constitution: Delaware and New\\nJersey unanimously and Pennsylvania after a short, though savage,\\ncontest. Connecticut and Georgia followed early the next year. Then came\\nthe battle royal in Massachusetts, ending in ratification in February by\\nthe narrow margin of 187 votes to 168. In the spring came the news that\\nMaryland and South Carolina were \"under the new roof.\" On June 21, New\\nHampshire, where the sentiment was at first strong enough to defeat the\\nConstitution, joined the new republic, influenced by the favorable\\ndecision in Massachusetts. Swift couriers were sent to carry the news to\\nNew York and Virginia, where the question of ratification was still\\nundecided. Nine states had accepted it and were united, whether more saw\\nfit to join or not.\\n\\nMeanwhile, however, Virginia, after a long and searching debate, had\\ngiven her approval by a narrow margin, leaving New York as the next seat\\nof anxiety. In that state the popular vote for the delegates to the\\nconvention had been clearly and heavily against ratification. Events\\nfinally demonstrated the futility of resistance, and Hamilton by good\\njudgment and masterly arguments was at last able to marshal a majority\\nof thirty to twenty-seven votes in favor of ratification.\\n\\nThe great contest was over. All the states, except North Carolina and\\nRhode Island, had ratified. \"The sloop Anarchy,\" wrote an ebullient\\njournalist, \"when last heard from was ashore on Union rocks.\"\\n\\n=The First Election.=--In the autumn of 1788, elections were held to\\nfill the places in the new government. Public opinion was overwhelmingly\\nin favor of Washington as the first President. Yielding to the\\nimportunities of friends, he accepted the post in the spirit of public\\nservice. On April 30, 1789, he took the oath of office at Federal Hall\\nin New York City. \"Long live George Washington, President of the United\\nStates!\" cried Chancellor Livingston as soon as the General had kissed\\nthe Bible. The cry was caught by the assembled multitude and given back.\\nA new experiment in popular government was launched.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nM.

Several members of the House of\\nRepresentatives, headed by James Madison, had also been at Philadelphia\\nin 1787. In making his appointments, Washington strengthened the new\\nsystem of government still further by a judicious selection of\\nofficials. He chose as Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton,\\nwho had been the most zealous for its success; General Knox, head of the\\nWar Department, and Edmund Randolph, the Attorney-General, were likewise\\nconspicuous friends of the experiment. Every member of the federal\\njudiciary whom Washington appointed, from the Chief Justice, John Jay,\\ndown to the justices of the district courts, had favored the\\nratification of the Constitution; and a majority of them had served as\\nmembers of the national convention that framed the document or of the\\nstate ratifying conventions. Only one man of influence in the new\\ngovernment, Thomas Jefferson, the Secretary of State, was reckoned as a\\ndoubter in the house of the faithful. He had expressed opinions both for\\nand against the Constitution; but he had been out of the country acting\\nas the minister at Paris when the Constitution was drafted and ratified.\\n\\n=An Opposition to Conciliate.=--The inauguration of Washington amid the\\nplaudits of his countrymen did not set at rest all the political turmoil\\nwhich had been aroused by the angry contest over ratification. \"The\\ninteresting nature of the question,\" wrote John Marshall, \"the equality\\nof the parties, the animation produced inevitably by ardent debate had a\\nnecessary tendency to embitter the dispositions of the vanquished and to\\nfix more deeply in many bosoms their prejudices against a plan of\\ngovernment in opposition to which all their passions were enlisted.\" The\\nleaders gathered around Washington were well aware of the excited state\\nof the country. They saw Rhode Island and North Carolina still outside\\nof the union.[1] They knew by what small margins the Constitution had\\nbeen approved in the great states of Massachusetts, Virginia, and New\\nYork. They were equally aware that a majority of the state conventions,\\nin yielding reluctant approval to the Constitution, had drawn a number\\nof amendments for immediate submission to the states.\\n\\n=The First Amendments--a Bill of Rights.=--To meet the opposition,\\nMadison proposed, and the first Congress adopted, a series of amendments\\nto the Constitution. Ten of them were soon ratified and became in 1791 a\\npart of the law of the land. These amendments provided, among other\\nthings, that Congress could make no law respecting the establishment of\\nreligion, abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right\\nof the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for a\\nredress of grievances. They also guaranteed indictment by grand jury and\\ntrial by jury for all persons charged by federal officers with serious\\ncrimes. To reassure those who still feared that local rights might be\\ninvaded by the federal government, the tenth amendment expressly\\nprovided that the powers not delegated to the United States by the\\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the\\nstates respectively or to the people. Seven years later, the eleventh\\namendment was written in the same spirit as the first ten, after a\\nheated debate over the action of the Supreme Court in permitting a\\ncitizen to bring a suit against \"the sovereign state\" of Georgia. The\\nnew amendment was designed to protect states against the federal\\njudiciary by forbidding it to hear any case in which a state was sued by\\na citizen.\\n\\n=Funding the National Debt.=--Paper declarations of rights, however,\\npaid no bills. To this task Hamilton turned all his splendid genius. At\\nthe very outset he addressed himself to the problem of the huge public\\ndebt, daily mounting as the unpaid interest accumulated. In a _Report on\\nPublic Credit_ under date of January 9, 1790, one of the first and\\ngreatest of American state papers, he laid before Congress the outlines\\nof his plan. He proposed that the federal government should call in all\\nthe old bonds, certificates of indebtedness, and other promises to pay\\nwhich had been issued by the Congress since the beginning of the\\nRevolution. These national obligations, he urged, should be put into one\\nconsolidated debt resting on the credit of the United States; to the\\nholders of the old paper should be issued new bonds drawing interest at\\nfixed rates. This process was called \"funding the debt.\" Such a\\nprovision for the support of public credit, Hamilton insisted, would\\nsatisfy creditors, restore landed property to its former value, and\\nfurnish new resources to agriculture and commerce in the form of credit\\nand capital.\\n\\n=Assumption and Funding of State Debts.=--Hamilton then turned to the\\nobligations incurred by the several states in support of the Revolution.\\nThese debts he proposed to add to the national debt. They were to be\\n\"assumed\" by the United States government and placed on the same secure\\nfoundation as the continental debt. This measure he defended not merely\\non grounds of national honor. It would, as he foresaw, give strength to\\nthe new national government by making all public creditors, men of\\nsubstance in their several communities, look to the federal, rather than\\nthe state government, for the satisfaction of their claims.\\n\\n=Funding at Face Value.=--On the question of the terms of consolidation,\\nassumption, and funding, Hamilton had a firm conviction. That millions\\nof dollars\\' worth of the continental and state bonds had passed out of\\nthe hands of those who had originally subscribed their funds to the\\nsupport of the government or had sold supplies for the Revolutionary\\narmy was well known. It was also a matter of common knowledge that a\\nvery large part of these bonds had been bought by speculators at ruinous\\nfigures--ten, twenty, and thirty cents on the dollar. Accordingly, it\\nhad been suggested, even in very respectable quarters, that a\\ndiscrimination should be made between original holders and speculative\\npurchasers. Some who held this opinion urged that the speculators who\\nhad paid nominal sums for their bonds should be reimbursed for their\\noutlays and the original holders paid the difference; others said that\\nthe government should \"scale the debt\" by redeeming, not at full value\\nbut at a figure reasonably above the market price. Against the\\nproposition Hamilton set his face like flint. He maintained that the\\ngovernment was honestly bound to redeem every bond at its face value,\\nalthough the difficulty of securing revenue made necessary a lower rate\\nof interest on a part of the bonds and the deferring of interest on\\nanother part.\\n\\n=Funding and Assumption Carried.=--There was little difficulty in\\nsecuring the approval of both houses of Congress for the funding of the\\nnational debt at full value. The bill for the assumption of state debts,\\nhowever, brought the sharpest division of opinions. To the Southern\\nmembers of Congress assumption was a gross violation of states\\' rights,\\nwithout any warrant in the Constitution and devised in the interest of\\nNorthern speculators who, anticipating assumption and funding, had\\nbought up at low prices the Southern bonds and other promises to pay.\\nNew England, on the other hand, was strongly in favor of assumption;\\nseveral representatives from that section were rash enough to threaten a\\ndissolution of the union if the bill was defeated. To this dispute was\\nadded an equally bitter quarrel over the location of the national\\ncapital, then temporarily at New York City.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIRST UNITED STATES BANK AT PHILADELPHIA]\\n\\nA deadlock, accompanied by the most surly feelings on both sides,\\nthreatened the very existence of the young government. Washington and\\nHamilton were thoroughly alarmed. Hearing of the extremity to which the\\ncontest had been carried and acting on the appeal from the Secretary of\\nthe Treasury, Jefferson intervened at this point. By skillful management\\nat a good dinner he brought the opposing leaders together; and thus once\\nmore, as on many other occasions, peace was purchased and the union\\nsaved by compromise. The bargain this time consisted of an exchange of\\nvotes for assumption in return for votes for the capital. Enough\\nSouthern members voted for assumption to pass the bill, and a majority\\nwas mustered in favor of building the capital on the banks of the\\nPotomac, after locating it for a ten-year period at Philadelphia to\\nsatisfy Pennsylvania members.\\n\\n=The United States Bank.=--Encouraged by the success of his funding and\\nassumption measures, Hamilton laid before Congress a project for a great\\nUnited States Bank. He proposed that a private corporation be chartered\\nby Congress, authorized to raise a capital stock of $10,000,000\\n(three-fourths in new six per cent federal bonds and one-fourth in\\nspecie) and empowered to issue paper currency under proper safeguards.\\nMany advantages, Hamilton contended, would accrue to the government from\\nthis institution. The price of the government bonds would be increased,\\nthus enhancing public credit. A national currency would be created of\\nuniform value from one end of the land to the other. The branches of the\\nbank in various cities would make easy the exchange of funds so vital to\\ncommercial transactions on a national scale. Finally, through the issue\\nof bank notes, the money capital available for agriculture and industry\\nwould be increased, thus stimulating business enterprise. Jefferson\\nhotly attacked the bank on the ground that Congress had no power\\nwhatever under the Constitution to charter such a private corporation.\\nHamilton defended it with great cogency. Washington, after weighing all\\nopinions, decided in favor of the proposal. In 1791 the bill\\nestablishing the first United States Bank for a period of twenty years\\nbecame a law.\\n\\n=The Protective Tariff.=--A third part of Hamilton\\'s program was the\\nprotection of American industries. The first revenue act of 1789, though\\ndesigned primarily to bring money into the empty treasury, declared in\\nfavor of the principle. The following year Washington referred to the\\nsubject in his address to Congress. Thereupon Hamilton was instructed to\\nprepare recommendations for legislative action. The result, after a\\ndelay of more than a year, was his _Report on Manufactures_, another\\nstate paper worthy, in closeness of reasoning and keenness of\\nunderstanding, of a place beside his report on public credit. Hamilton\\nbased his argument on the broadest national grounds: the protective\\ntariff would, by encouraging the building of factories, create a home\\nmarket for the produce of farms and plantations; by making the United\\nStates independent of other countries in times of peace, it would double\\nits security in time of war; by making use of the labor of women and\\nchildren, it would turn to the production of goods persons otherwise\\nidle or only partly employed; by increasing the trade between the North\\nand South it would strengthen the links of union and add to political\\nties those of commerce and intercourse. The revenue measure of 1792 bore\\nthe impress of these arguments.\\n\\n\\nTHE RISE OF POLITICAL PARTIES\\n\\n=Dissensions over Hamilton\\'s Measures.=--Hamilton\\'s plans, touching\\ndeeply as they did the resources of individuals and the interests of the\\nstates, awakened alarm and opposition. Funding at face value, said his\\ncritics, was a government favor to speculators; the assumption of state\\ndebts was a deep design to undermine the state governments; Congress had\\nno constitutional power to create a bank; the law creating the bank\\nmerely allowed a private corporation to make paper money and lend it at\\na high rate of interest; and the tariff was a tax on land and labor for\\nthe benefit of manufacturers.\\n\\nHamilton\\'s reply to this bill of indictment was simple and\\nstraightforward. Some rascally speculators had profited from the funding\\nof the debt at face value, but that was only an incident in the\\nrestoration of public credit. In view of the jealousies of the states it\\nwas a good thing to reduce their powers and pretensions. The\\nConstitution was not to be interpreted narrowly but in the full light of\\nnational needs. The bank would enlarge the amount of capital so sorely\\nneeded to start up American industries, giving markets to farmers and\\nplanters. The tariff by creating a home market and increasing\\nopportunities for employment would benefit both land and labor. Out of\\nsuch wise policies firmly pursued by the government, he concluded, were\\nbound to come strength and prosperity for the new government at home,\\ncredit and power abroad. This view Washington fully indorsed, adding\\nthe weight of his great name to the inherent merits of the measures\\nadopted under his administration.\\n\\n=The Sharpness of the Partisan Conflict.=--As a result of the clash of\\nopinion, the people of the country gradually divided into two parties:\\nFederalists and Anti-Federalists, the former led by Hamilton, the latter\\nby Jefferson. The strength of the Federalists lay in the cities--Boston,\\nProvidence, Hartford, New York, Philadelphia, Charleston--among the\\nmanufacturing, financial, and commercial groups of the population who\\nwere eager to extend their business operations. The strength of the\\nAnti-Federalists lay mainly among the debt-burdened farmers who feared\\nthe growth of what they called \"a money power\" and planters in all\\nsections who feared the dominance of commercial and manufacturing\\ninterests. The farming and planting South, outside of the few towns,\\nfinally presented an almost solid front against assumption, the bank,\\nand the tariff. The conflict between the parties grew steadily in\\nbitterness, despite the conciliatory and engaging manner in which\\nHamilton presented his cause in his state papers and despite the\\nconstant efforts of Washington to soften the asperity of the\\ncontestants.\\n\\n=The Leadership and Doctrines of Jefferson.=--The party dispute had not\\ngone far before the opponents of the administration began to look to\\nJefferson as their leader. Some of Hamilton\\'s measures he had approved,\\ndeclaring afterward that he did not at the time understand their\\nsignificance. Others, particularly the bank, he fiercely assailed. More\\nthan once, he and Hamilton, shaking violently with anger, attacked each\\nother at cabinet meetings, and nothing short of the grave and dignified\\npleas of Washington prevented an early and open break between them. In\\n1794 it finally came. Jefferson resigned as Secretary of State and\\nretired to his home in Virginia to assume, through correspondence and\\nnegotiation, the leadership of the steadily growing party of opposition.\\n\\nShy and modest in manner, halting in speech, disliking the turmoil of\\npublic debate, and deeply interested in science and philosophy,\\nJefferson was not very well fitted for the strenuous life of political\\ncontest. Nevertheless, he was an ambitious and shrewd negotiator. He was\\nalso by honest opinion and matured conviction the exact opposite of\\nHamilton. The latter believed in a strong, active, \"high-toned\"\\ngovernment, vigorously compelling in all its branches. Jefferson looked\\nupon such government as dangerous to the liberties of citizens and\\nopenly avowed his faith in the desirability of occasional popular\\nuprisings. Hamilton distrusted the people. \"Your people is a great\\nbeast,\" he is reported to have said. Jefferson professed his faith in\\nthe people with an abandon that was considered reckless in his time.\\n\\nOn economic matters, the opinions of the two leaders were also\\nhopelessly at variance. Hamilton, while cherishing agriculture, desired\\nto see America a great commercial and industrial nation. Jefferson was\\nequally set against this course for his country. He feared the\\naccumulation of riches and the growth of a large urban working class.\\nThe mobs of great cities, he said, are sores on the body politic;\\nartisans are usually the dangerous element that make revolutions;\\nworkshops should be kept in Europe and with them the artisans with their\\ninsidious morals and manners. The only substantial foundation for a\\nrepublic, Jefferson believed to be agriculture. The spirit of\\nindependence could be kept alive only by free farmers, owning the land\\nthey tilled and looking to the sun in heaven and the labor of their\\nhands for their sustenance. Trusting as he did in the innate goodness of\\nhuman nature when nourished on a free soil, Jefferson advocated those\\nmeasures calculated to favor agriculture and to enlarge the rights of\\npersons rather than the powers of government. Thus he became the\\nchampion of the individual against the interference of the government,\\nand an ardent advocate of freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and\\nfreedom of scientific inquiry. It was, accordingly, no mere factious\\nspirit that drove him into opposition to Hamilton.\\n\\n=The Whisky Rebellion.=--The political agitation of the Anti-Federalists\\nwas accompanied by an armed revolt against the government in 1794. The\\noccasion for this uprising was another of Hamilton\\'s measures, a law\\nlaying an excise tax on distilled spirits, for the purpose of increasing\\nthe revenue needed to pay the interest on the funded debt. It so\\nhappened that a very considerable part of the whisky manufactured in the\\ncountry was made by the farmers, especially on the frontier, in their\\nown stills. The new revenue law meant that federal officers would now\\ncome into the homes of the people, measure their liquor, and take the\\ntax out of their pockets. All the bitterness which farmers felt against\\nthe fiscal measures of the government was redoubled. In the western\\ndistricts of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina, they refused to\\npay the tax. In Pennsylvania, some of them sacked and burned the houses\\nof the tax collectors, as the Revolutionists thirty years before had\\nmobbed the agents of King George sent over to sell stamps. They were in\\na fair way to nullify the law in whole districts when Washington called\\nout the troops to suppress \"the Whisky Rebellion.\" Then the movement\\ncollapsed; but it left behind a deep-seated resentment which flared up\\nin the election of several obdurate Anti-Federalist Congressmen from the\\ndisaffected regions.\\n\\n\\nFOREIGN INFLUENCES AND DOMESTIC POLITICS\\n\\n=The French Revolution.=--In this exciting period, when all America was\\ndistracted by partisan disputes, a storm broke in Europe--the\\nepoch-making French Revolution--which not only shook the thrones of the\\nOld World but stirred to its depths the young republic of the New World.\\nThe first scene in this dramatic affair occurred in the spring of 1789,\\na few days after Washington was inaugurated. The king of France, Louis\\nXVI, driven into bankruptcy by extravagance and costly wars, was forced\\nto resort to his people for financial help. Accordingly he called, for\\nthe first time in more than one hundred fifty years, a meeting of the\\nnational parliament, the \"Estates General,\" composed of representatives\\nof the \"three estates\"--the clergy, nobility, and commoners. Acting\\nunder powerful leaders, the commoners, or \"third estate,\" swept aside\\nthe clergy and nobility and resolved themselves into a national\\nassembly. This stirred the country to its depths.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n\\nLOUIS XVI IN THE HANDS OF THE MOB]\\n\\nGreat events followed in swift succession. On July 14, 1789, the\\nBastille, an old royal prison, symbol of the king\\'s absolutism, was\\nstormed by a Paris crowd and destroyed. On the night of August 4, the\\nfeudal privileges of the nobility were abolished by the national\\nassembly amid great excitement. A few days later came the famous\\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man, proclaiming the sovereignty of the\\npeople and the privileges of citizens. In the autumn of 1791, Louis XVI\\nwas forced to accept a new constitution for France vesting the\\nlegislative power in a popular assembly. Little disorder accompanied\\nthese startling changes. To all appearances a peaceful revolution had\\nstripped the French king of his royal prerogatives and based the\\ngovernment of his country on the consent of the governed.\\n\\n=American Influence in France.=--In undertaking their great political\\nrevolt the French had been encouraged by the outcome of the American\\nRevolution. Officers and soldiers, who had served in the American war,\\nreported to their French countrymen marvelous tales. At the frugal table\\nof General Washington, in council with the unpretentious Franklin, or at\\nconferences over the strategy of war, French noblemen of ancient lineage\\nlearned to respect both the talents and the simple character of the\\nleaders in the great republican commonwealth beyond the seas. Travelers,\\nwho had gone to see the experiment in republicanism with their own eyes,\\ncarried home to the king and ruling class stories of an astounding\\nsystem of popular government.\\n\\nOn the other hand the dalliance with American democracy was regarded by\\nFrench conservatives as playing with fire. \"When we think of the false\\nideas of government and philanthropy,\" wrote one of Lafayette\\'s aides,\\n\"which these youths acquired in America and propagated in France with so\\nmuch enthusiasm and such deplorable success--for this mania of imitation\\npowerfully aided the Revolution, though it was not the sole cause of\\nit--we are bound to confess that it would have been better, both for\\nthemselves and for us, if these young philosophers in red-heeled shoes\\nhad stayed at home in attendance on the court.\"\\n\\n=Early American Opinion of the French Revolution.=--So close were the\\nties between the two nations that it is not surprising to find every\\nstep in the first stages of the French Revolution greeted with applause\\nin the United States. \"Liberty will have another feather in her cap,\"\\nexultantly wrote a Boston editor. \"In no part of the globe,\" soberly\\nwrote John Marshall, \"was this revolution hailed with more joy than in\\nAmerica.... But one sentiment existed.\" The main key to the Bastille,\\nsent to Washington as a memento, was accepted as \"a token of the\\nvictory gained by liberty.\" Thomas Paine saw in the great event \"the\\nfirst ripe fruits of American principles transplanted into Europe.\"\\nFederalists and Anti-Federalists regarded the new constitution of France\\nas another vindication of American ideals.\\n\\n=The Reign of Terror.=--While profuse congratulations were being\\nexchanged, rumors began to come that all was not well in France. Many\\nnoblemen, enraged at the loss of their special privileges, fled into\\nGermany and plotted an invasion of France to overthrow the new system of\\ngovernment. Louis XVI entered into negotiations with his brother\\nmonarchs on the continent to secure their help in the same enterprise,\\nand he finally betrayed to the French people his true sentiments by\\nattempting to escape from his kingdom, only to be captured and taken\\nback to Paris in disgrace.\\n\\nA new phase of the revolution now opened. The working people, excluded\\nfrom all share in the government by the first French constitution,\\nbecame restless, especially in Paris. Assembling on the Champs de Mars,\\na great open field, they signed a petition calling for another\\nconstitution giving them the suffrage. When told to disperse, they\\nrefused and were fired upon by the national guard. This \"massacre,\" as\\nit was called, enraged the populace. A radical party, known as\\n\"Jacobins,\" then sprang up, taking its name from a Jacobin monastery in\\nwhich it held its sessions. In a little while it became the master of\\nthe popular convention convoked in September, 1792. The monarchy was\\nimmediately abolished and a republic established. On January 21, 1793,\\nLouis was sent to the scaffold. To the war on Austria, already raging,\\nwas added a war on England. Then came the Reign of Terror, during which\\nradicals in possession of the convention executed in large numbers\\ncounter-revolutionists and those suspected of sympathy with the\\nmonarchy. They shot down peasants who rose in insurrection against their\\nrule and established a relentless dictatorship. Civil war followed.\\nTerrible atrocities were committed on both sides in the name of liberty,\\nand in the name of monarchy. To Americans of conservative temper it now\\nseemed that the Revolution, so auspiciously begun, had degenerated into\\nanarchy and mere bloodthirsty strife.\\n\\n=Burke Summons the World to War on France.=--In England, Edmund Burke\\nled the fight against the new French principles which he feared might\\nspread to all Europe. In his _Reflections on the French Revolution_,\\nwritten in 1790, he attacked with terrible wrath the whole program of\\npopular government; he called for war, relentless war, upon the French\\nas monsters and outlaws; he demanded that they be reduced to order by\\nthe restoration of the king to full power under the protection of the\\narms of European nations.\\n\\n=Paine\\'s Defense of the French Revolution.=--To counteract the campaign\\nof hate against the French, Thomas Paine replied to Burke in another of\\nhis famous tracts, _The Rights of Man_, which was given to the American\\npublic in an edition containing a letter of approval from Jefferson.\\nBurke, said Paine, had been mourning about the glories of the French\\nmonarchy and aristocracy but had forgotten the starving peasants and the\\noppressed people; had wept over the plumage and neglected the dying\\nbird. Burke had denied the right of the French people to choose their\\nown governors, blandly forgetting that the English government in which\\nhe saw final perfection itself rested on two revolutions. He had boasted\\nthat the king of England held his crown in contempt of the democratic\\nsocieties. Paine answered: \"If I ask a man in America if he wants a\\nking, he retorts and asks me if I take him for an idiot.\" To the charge\\nthat the doctrines of the rights of man were \"new fangled,\" Paine\\nreplied that the question was not whether they were new or old but\\nwhether they were right or wrong. As to the French disorders and\\ndifficulties, he bade the world wait to see what would be brought forth\\nin due time.\\n\\n=The Effect of the French Revolution on American Politics.=--The course\\nof the French Revolution and the controversies accompanying it,\\nexercised a profound influence on the formation of the first political\\nparties in America. The followers of Hamilton, now proud of the name\\n\"Federalists,\" drew back in fright as they heard of the cruel deeds\\ncommitted during the Reign of Terror. They turned savagely upon the\\nrevolutionists and their friends in America, denouncing as \"Jacobin\"\\neverybody who did not condemn loudly enough the proceedings of the\\nFrench Republic. A Massachusetts preacher roundly assailed \"the\\natheistical, anarchical, and in other respects immoral principles of the\\nFrench Republicans\"; he then proceeded with equal passion to attack\\nJefferson and the Anti-Federalists, whom he charged with spreading false\\nFrench propaganda and betraying America. \"The editors, patrons, and\\nabettors of these vehicles of slander,\" he exclaimed, \"ought to be\\nconsidered and treated as enemies to their country.... Of all traitors\\nthey are the most aggravatedly criminal; of all villains, they are the\\nmost infamous and detestable.\"\\n\\nThe Anti-Federalists, as a matter of fact, were generally favorable to\\nthe Revolution although they deplored many of the events associated with\\nit. Paine\\'s pamphlet, indorsed by Jefferson, was widely read. Democratic\\nsocieties, after the fashion of French political clubs, arose in the\\ncities; the coalition of European monarchs against France was denounced\\nas a coalition against the very principles of republicanism; and the\\nexecution of Louis XVI was openly celebrated at a banquet in\\nPhiladelphia. Harmless titles, such as \"Sir,\" \"the Honorable,\" and \"His\\nExcellency,\" were decried as aristocratic and some of the more excited\\ninsisted on adopting the French title, \"Citizen,\" speaking, for example,\\nof \"Citizen Judge\" and \"Citizen Toastmaster.\" Pamphlets in defense of\\nthe French streamed from the press, while subsidized newspapers kept the\\npropaganda in full swing.\\n\\n=The European War Disturbs American Commerce.=--This battle of wits, or\\nrather contest in calumny, might have gone on indefinitely in America\\nwithout producing any serious results, had it not been for the war\\nbetween England and France, then raging. The English, having command of\\nthe seas, claimed the right to seize American produce bound for French\\nports and to confiscate American ships engaged in carrying French goods.\\nAdding fuel to a fire already hot enough, they began to search American\\nships and to carry off British-born sailors found on board American\\nvessels.\\n\\n=The French Appeal for Help.=--At the same time the French Republic\\nturned to the United States for aid in its war on England and sent over\\nas its diplomatic representative \"Citizen\" Genet, an ardent supporter of\\nthe new order. On his arrival at Charleston, he was greeted with fervor\\nby the Anti-Federalists. As he made his way North, he was wined and\\ndined and given popular ovations that turned his head. He thought the\\nwhole country was ready to join the French Republic in its contest with\\nEngland. Genet therefore attempted to use the American ports as the base\\nof operations for French privateers preying on British merchant ships;\\nand he insisted that the United States was in honor bound to help France\\nunder the treaty of 1778.\\n\\n=The Proclamation of Neutrality and the Jay Treaty.=--Unmoved by the\\n\\nrising tide of popular sympathy for France, Washington took a firm\\ncourse. He received Genet coldly. The demand that the United States aid\\nFrance under the old treaty of alliance he answered by proclaiming the\\nneutrality of America and warning American citizens against hostile acts\\ntoward either France or England. When Genet continued to hold meetings,\\nissue manifestoes, and stir up the people against England, Washington\\nasked the French government to recall him. This act he followed up by\\nsending the Chief Justice, John Jay, on a pacific mission to England.\\n\\nThe result was the celebrated Jay treaty of 1794. By its terms Great\\nBritain agreed to withdraw her troops from the western forts where they\\nhad been since the war for independence and to grant certain slight\\ntrade concessions. The chief sources of bitterness--the failure of the\\nBritish to return slaves carried off during the Revolution, the seizure\\nof American ships, and the impressment of sailors--were not touched,\\nmuch to the distress of everybody in America, including loyal\\nFederalists. Nevertheless, Washington, dreading an armed conflict with\\nEngland, urged the Senate to ratify the treaty. The weight of his\\ninfluence carried the day.\\n\\nAt this, the hostility of the Anti-Federalists knew no bounds. Jefferson\\ndeclared the Jay treaty \"an infamous act which is really nothing more\\nthan an alliance between England and the Anglo-men of this country,\\nagainst the legislature and the people of the United States.\" Hamilton,\\ndefending it with his usual courage, was stoned by a mob in New York and\\ndriven from the platform with blood streaming from his face. Jay was\\nburned in effigy. Even Washington was not spared. The House of\\nRepresentatives was openly hostile. To display its feelings, it called\\nupon the President for the papers relative to the treaty negotiations,\\nonly to be more highly incensed by his flat refusal to present them, on\\nthe ground that the House did not share in the treaty-making power.\\n\\n=Washington Retires from Politics.=--Such angry contests confirmed the\\nPresident in his slowly maturing determination to retire at the end of\\nhis second term in office. He did not believe that a third term was\\nunconstitutional or improper; but, worn out by his long and arduous\\nlabors in war and in peace and wounded by harsh attacks from former\\nfriends, he longed for the quiet of his beautiful estate at Mount\\nVernon.\\n\\nIn September, 1796, on the eve of the presidential election, Washington\\nissued his Farewell Address, another state paper to be treasured and\\nread by generations of Americans to come. In this address he directed\\nthe attention of the people to three subjects of lasting interest. He\\nwarned them against sectional jealousies. He remonstrated against the\\nspirit of partisanship, saying that in government \"of the popular\\ncharacter, in government purely elective, it is a spirit not to be\\nencouraged.\" He likewise cautioned the people against \"the insidious\\nwiles of foreign influence,\" saying: \"Europe has a set of primary\\ninterests which to us have none or a very remote relation. Hence she\\nmust be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are\\nessentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it would be\\nunwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary\\nvicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions\\nof her friendships or enmities.... Why forego the advantages of so\\npeculiar a situation?... It is our true policy to steer clear of\\npermanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.... Taking\\ncare always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on a\\nrespectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary\\nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\"\\n\\n=The Campaign of 1796--Adams Elected.=--On hearing of the retirement of\\nWashington, the Anti-Federalists cast off all restraints. In honor of\\nFrance and in opposition to what they were pleased to call the\\nmonarchical tendencies of the Federalists, they boldly assumed the name\\n\"Republican\"; the term \"Democrat,\" then applied only to obscure and\\ndespised radicals, had not come into general use. They selected\\nJefferson as their candidate for President against John Adams, the\\nFederalist nominee, and carried on such a spirited campaign that they\\ncame within four votes of electing him.\\n\\nThe successful candidate, Adams, was not fitted by training or opinion\\nfor conciliating a determined opposition. He was a reserved and studious\\nman. He was neither a good speaker nor a skillful negotiator. In one of\\nhis books he had declared himself in favor of \"government by an\\naristocracy of talents and wealth\"--an offense which the Republicans\\nnever forgave. While John Marshall found him \"a sensible, plain, candid,\\ngood-tempered man,\" Jefferson could see in him nothing but a \"monocrat\"\\nand \"Anglo-man.\" Had it not been for the conduct of the French\\ngovernment, Adams would hardly have enjoyed a moment\\'s genuine\\npopularity during his administration.\\n\\n=The Quarrel with France.=--The French Directory, the executive\\ndepartment established under the constitution of 1795, managed, however,\\nto stir the anger of Republicans and Federalists alike. It regarded the\\nJay treaty as a rebuke to France and a flagrant violation of obligations\\nsolemnly registered in the treaty of 1778. Accordingly it refused to\\nreceive the American minister, treated him in a humiliating way, and\\nfinally told him to leave the country. Overlooking this affront in his\\nanxiety to maintain peace, Adams dispatched to France a commission of\\neminent men with instructions to reach an understanding with the French\\nRepublic. On their arrival, they were chagrined to find, instead of a\\ndecent reception, an indirect demand for an apology respecting the past\\nconduct of the American government, a payment in cash, and an annual\\ntribute as the price of continued friendship. When the news of this\\naffair reached President Adams, he promptly laid it before Congress,\\nreferring to the Frenchmen who had made the demands as \"Mr. X, Mr. Y,\\nand Mr. Z.\"\\n\\nThis insult, coupled with the fact that French privateers, like the\\nBritish, were preying upon American commerce, enraged even the\\nRepublicans who had been loudest in the profession of their French\\nsympathies. They forgot their wrath over the Jay treaty and joined with\\nthe Federalists in shouting: \"Millions for defense, not a cent for\\ntribute!\" Preparations for war were made on every hand. Washington was\\nonce more called from Mount Vernon to take his old position at the head\\nof the army. Indeed, fighting actually began upon the high seas and went\\non without a formal declaration of war until the year 1800. By that time\\nthe Directory had been overthrown. A treaty was readily made with\\nNapoleon, the First Consul, who was beginning his remarkable career as\\nchief of the French Republic, soon to be turned into an empire.\\n\\n=Alien and Sedition Laws.=--Flushed with success, the Federalists\\ndetermined, if possible, to put an end to radical French influence in\\nAmerica and to silence Republican opposition. They therefore passed two\\ndrastic laws in the summer of 1798: the Alien and Sedition Acts.\\n\\nThe first of these measures empowered the President to expel from the\\ncountry or to imprison any alien whom he regarded as \"dangerous\" or \"had\\nreasonable grounds to suspect\" of \"any treasonable or secret\\nmachinations against the government.\"\\n\\nThe second of the measures, the Sedition Act, penalized not only those\\nwho attempted to stir up unlawful combinations against the government\\nbut also every one who wrote, uttered, or published \"any false,\\nscandalous, and malicious writing ... against the government of the\\nUnited States or either House of Congress, or the President of the\\nUnited States, with intent to defame said government ... or to bring\\nthem or either of them into contempt or disrepute.\" This measure was\\nhurried through Congress in spite of the opposition and the clear\\nprovision in the Constitution that Congress shall make no law abridging\\nthe freedom of speech or of the press. Even many Federalists feared the\\nconsequences of the action. Hamilton was alarmed when he read the bill,\\nexclaiming: \"Let us not establish a tyranny. Energy is a very different\\nthing from violence.\" John Marshall told his friends in Virginia that,\\nhad he been in Congress, he would have opposed the two bills because he\\nthought them \"useless\" and \"calculated to create unnecessary discontents\\nand jealousies.\"\\n\\nThe Alien law was not enforced; but it gave great offense to the Irish\\nand French whose activities against the American government\\'s policy\\nrespecting Great Britain put them in danger of prison. The Sedition law,\\non the other hand, was vigorously applied. Several editors of Republican\\nnewspapers soon found themselves in jail or broken by ruinous fines for\\ntheir caustic criticisms of the Federalist President and his policies.\\nBystanders at political meetings, who uttered sentiments which, though\\nungenerous and severe, seem harmless enough now, were hurried before\\nFederalist judges and promptly fined and imprisoned. Although the\\nprosecutions were not numerous, they aroused a keen resentment. The\\nRepublicans were convinced that their political opponents, having\\nsaddled upon the country Hamilton\\'s fiscal system and the British\\ntreaty, were bent on silencing all censure. The measures therefore had\\nexactly the opposite effect from that which their authors intended.\\nInstead of helping the Federalist party, they made criticism of it more\\nbitter than ever.\\n\\n=The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions.=--Jefferson was quick to take\\nadvantage of the discontent. He drafted a set of resolutions declaring\\nthe Sedition law null and void, as violating the federal Constitution.\\nHis resolutions were passed by the Kentucky legislature late in 1798,\\nsigned by the governor, and transmitted to the other states for their\\nconsideration. Though receiving unfavorable replies from a number of\\nNorthern states, Kentucky the following year reaffirmed its position and\\ndeclared that the nullification of all unconstitutional acts of Congress\\nwas the rightful remedy to be used by the states in the redress of\\ngrievances. It thus defied the federal government and announced a\\ndoctrine hostile to nationality and fraught with terrible meaning for\\nthe future. In the neighboring state of Virginia, Madison led a movement\\nagainst the Alien and Sedition laws. He induced the legislature to pass\\nresolutions condemning the acts as unconstitutional and calling upon the\\nother states to take proper means to preserve their rights and the\\nrights of the people.\\n\\n=The Republican Triumph in 1800.=--Thus the way was prepared for the\\nelection of 1800. The Republicans left no stone unturned in their\\nefforts to place on the Federalist candidate, President Adams, all the\\nodium of the Alien and Sedition laws, in addition to responsibility for\\napproving Hamilton\\'s measures and policies. The Federalists, divided in\\ncouncils and cold in their affection for Adams, made a poor campaign.\\nThey tried to discredit their opponents with epithets of \"Jacobins\" and\\n\"Anarchists\"--terms which had been weakened by excessive use. When the\\nvote was counted, it was found that Adams had been defeated; while the\\nRepublicans had carried the entire South and New York also and secured\\neight of the fifteen electoral votes cast by Pennsylvania. \"Our beloved\\nAdams will now close his bright career,\" lamented a Federalist\\nnewspaper. \"Sons of faction, demagogues and high priests of anarchy, now\\nyou have cause to triumph!\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _An old cartoon_\\n\\nA QUARREL BETWEEN A FEDERALIST AND A REPUBLICAN IN THE HOUSE OF\\nREPRESENTATIVES]\\n\\nJefferson\\'s election, however, was still uncertain. By a curious\\nprovision in the Constitution, presidential electors were required to\\nvote for two persons without indicating which office each was to fill,\\nthe one receiving the highest number of votes to be President and the\\ncandidate standing next to be Vice President. It so happened that Aaron\\nBurr, the Republican candidate for Vice President, had received the same\\nnumber of votes as Jefferson; as neither had a majority the election was\\nthrown into the House of Representatives, where the Federalists held the\\nbalance of power. Although it was well known that Burr was not even a\\ncandidate for President, his friends and many Federalists began\\nintriguing for his election to that high office. Had it not been for the\\nvigorous action of Hamilton the prize might have been snatched out of\\nJefferson\\'s hands. Not until the thirty-sixth ballot on February 17,\\n1801, was the great issue decided in his favor.[2]\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nJ.S.

Their attachment to\\nAmerica was, certainly, as strong as that of Hamilton; but they regarded\\nthe state, rather than the national government, as the proper center of\\npower and affection. Indeed, a large part of the rank and file had been\\namong the opponents of the Constitution in the days of its adoption.\\nJefferson had entertained doubts about it and Monroe, destined to be the\\nfifth President, had been one of the bitter foes of ratification. The\\nformer went so far in the direction of local autonomy that he exalted\\nthe state above the nation in the Kentucky resolutions of 1798,\\ndeclaring the Constitution to be a mere compact and the states competent\\nto interpret and nullify federal law. This was provincialism with a\\nvengeance. \"It is jealousy, not confidence, which prescribes limited\\nconstitutions,\" wrote Jefferson for the Kentucky legislature. Jealousy\\nof the national government, not confidence in it--this is the ideal that\\nreflected the provincial and agricultural interest.\\n\\n=Republican Simplicity.=--Every act of the Jeffersonian party during its\\nearly days of power was in accord with the ideals of government which it\\nprofessed. It had opposed all pomp and ceremony, calculated to give\\nweight and dignity to the chief executive of the nation, as symbols of\\nmonarchy and high prerogative. Appropriately, therefore, Jefferson\\'s\\ninauguration on March 4, 1801, the first at the new capital at\\nWashington, was marked by extreme simplicity. In keeping with this\\nprocedure he quit the practice, followed by Washington and Adams, of\\nreading presidential addresses to Congress in joint assembly and adopted\\nin its stead the plan of sending his messages in writing--a custom that\\nwas continued unbroken until 1913 when President Wilson returned to the\\nexample set by the first chief magistrate.\\n\\n=Republican Measures.=--The Republicans had complained of a great\\nnational debt as the source of a dangerous \"money power,\" giving\\nstrength to the federal government; accordingly they began to pay it off\\nas rapidly as possible. They had held commerce in low esteem and looked\\nupon a large navy as a mere device to protect it; consequently they\\nreduced the number of warships. They had objected to excise taxes,\\nparticularly on whisky; these they quickly abolished, to the intense\\nsatisfaction of the farmers. They had protested against the heavy cost\\nof the federal government; they reduced expenses by discharging hundreds\\nof men from the army and abolishing many offices.\\n\\nThey had savagely criticized the Sedition law and Jefferson refused to\\nenforce it. They had been deeply offended by the assault on freedom of\\nspeech and press and they promptly impeached Samuel Chase, a justice of\\nthe Supreme Court, who had been especially severe in his attacks upon\\noffenders under the Sedition Act. Their failure to convict Justice Chase\\nby a narrow margin was due to no lack of zeal on their part but to the\\nFederalist strength in the Senate where the trial was held. They had\\nregarded the appointment of a large number of federal judges during the\\nlast hours of Adams\\' administration as an attempt to intrench\\nFederalists in the judiciary and to enlarge the sphere of the national\\ngovernment. Accordingly, they at once repealed the act creating the new\\njudgeships, thus depriving the \"midnight appointees\" of their posts.\\nThey had considered the federal offices, civil and military, as sources\\nof great strength to the Federalists and Jefferson, though committed to\\nthe principle that offices should be open to all and distributed\\naccording to merit, was careful to fill most of the vacancies as they\\noccurred with trusted Republicans. To his credit, however, it must be\\nsaid that he did not make wholesale removals to find room for party\\nworkers.\\n\\nThe Republicans thus hewed to the line of their general policy of\\nrestricting the weight, dignity, and activity of the national\\ngovernment. Yet there were no Republicans, as the Federalists asserted,\\nprepared to urge serious modifications in the Constitution. \"If there be\\nany among us who wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican\\nform,\" wrote Jefferson in his first inaugural, \"let them stand\\nundisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may\\nbe tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.\" After reciting the\\nfortunate circumstances of climate, soil, and isolation which made the\\nfuture of America so full of promise, Jefferson concluded: \"A wise and\\nfrugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another,\\nshall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of\\nindustry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labour the\\nbread it has earned. This is the sum of good government; and this is\\nnecessary to close the circle of our felicities.\"\\n\\nIn all this the Republicans had not reckoned with destiny. In a few\\nshort years that lay ahead it was their fate to double the territory of\\nthe country, making inevitable a continental nation; to give the\\nConstitution a generous interpretation that shocked many a Federalist;\\nto wage war on behalf of American commerce; to reestablish the hated\\nUnited States Bank; to enact a high protective tariff; to see their\\nFederalist opponents in their turn discredited as nullifiers and\\nprovincials; to announce high national doctrines in foreign affairs; and\\nto behold the Constitution exalted and defended against the pretensions\\nof states by a son of old Virginia, John Marshall, Chief Justice of the\\nSupreme Court of the United States.\\n\\n\\nTHE REPUBLICANS AND THE GREAT WEST\\n\\n=Expansion and Land Hunger.=--The first of the great measures which\\ndrove the Republicans out upon this new national course--the purchase\\nof the Louisiana territory--was the product of circumstances rather than\\nof their deliberate choosing. It was not the lack of land for his\\ncherished farmers that led Jefferson to add such an immense domain to\\nthe original possessions of the United States. In the Northwest\\nterritory, now embracing Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin,\\nand a portion of Minnesota, settlements were mainly confined to the\\nnorth bank of the Ohio River. To the south, in Kentucky and Tennessee,\\nwhere there were more than one hundred thousand white people who had\\npushed over the mountains from Virginia and the Carolinas, there were\\nstill wide reaches of untilled soil. The Alabama and Mississippi regions\\nwere vast Indian frontiers of the state of Georgia, unsettled and almost\\nunexplored. Even to the wildest imagination there seemed to be territory\\nenough to satisfy the land hunger of the American people for a century\\nto come.\\n\\n=The Significance of the Mississippi River.=--At all events the East,\\nthen the center of power, saw no good reason for expansion. The planters\\nof the Carolinas, the manufacturers of Pennsylvania, the importers of\\nNew York, the shipbuilders of New England, looking to the seaboard and\\nto Europe for trade, refinements, and sometimes their ideas of\\ngovernment, were slow to appreciate the place of the West in national\\neconomy. The better educated the Easterners were, the less, it seems,\\nthey comprehended the destiny of the nation. Sons of Federalist fathers\\nat Williams College, after a long debate decided by a vote of fifteen to\\none that the purchase of Louisiana was undesirable.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the pioneers of Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee,\\nunlearned in books, saw with their own eyes the resources of the\\nwilderness. Many of them had been across the Mississippi and had beheld\\nthe rich lands awaiting the plow of the white man. Down the great river\\nthey floated their wheat, corn, and bacon to ocean-going ships bound for\\nthe ports of the seaboard or for Europe. The land journeys over the\\nmountain barriers with bulky farm produce, they knew from experience,\\nwere almost impossible, and costly at best. Nails, bolts of cloth, tea,\\nand coffee could go or come that way, but not corn and bacon. A free\\noutlet to the sea by the Mississippi was as essential to the pioneers of\\nthe Kentucky region as the harbor of Boston to the merchant princes of\\nthat metropolis.\\n\\n=Louisiana under Spanish Rule.=--For this reason they watched with deep\\nsolicitude the fortunes of the Spanish king to whom, at the close of the\\nSeven Years\\' War, had fallen the Louisiana territory stretching from New\\nOrleans to the Rocky Mountains. While he controlled the mouth of the\\nMississippi there was little to fear, for he had neither the army nor\\nthe navy necessary to resist any invasion of American trade. Moreover,\\nWashington had been able, by the exercise of great tact, to secure from\\nSpain in 1795 a trading privilege through New Orleans which satisfied\\nthe present requirements of the frontiersmen even if it did not allay\\ntheir fears for the future. So things stood when a swift succession of\\nevents altered the whole situation.\\n\\n=Louisiana Transferred to France.=--In July, 1802, a royal order from\\nSpain instructed the officials at New Orleans to close the port to\\nAmerican produce. About the same time a disturbing rumor, long current,\\nwas confirmed--Napoleon had coerced Spain into returning Louisiana to\\nFrance by a secret treaty signed in 1800. \"The scalers of the Alps and\\nconquerors of Venice\" now looked across the sea for new scenes of\\nadventure. The West was ablaze with excitement. A call for war ran\\nthrough the frontier; expeditions were organized to prevent the landing\\nof the French; and petitions for instant action flooded in upon\\nJefferson.\\n\\n=Jefferson Sees the Danger.=--Jefferson, the friend of France and sworn\\nenemy of England, compelled to choose in the interest of America, never\\nwinced. \"The cession of Louisiana and the Floridas by Spain to France,\"\\nhe wrote to Livingston, the American minister in Paris, \"works sorely on\\nthe United States. It completely reverses all the political relations of\\nthe United States and will form a new epoch in our political course....\\nThere is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our\\nnatural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans through which the produce\\nof three-eighths of our territory must pass to market.... France,\\nplacing herself in that door, assumes to us an attitude of defiance.\\nSpain might have retained it quietly for years. Her pacific\\ndispositions, her feeble state would induce her to increase our\\nfacilities there.... Not so can it ever be in the hands of France....\\nThe day that France takes possession of New Orleans fixes the sentence\\nwhich is to restrain her forever within her low water mark.... It seals\\nthe union of the two nations who in conjunction can maintain exclusive\\npossession of the ocean. From that moment we must marry ourselves to the\\nBritish fleet and nation.... This is not a state of things we seek or\\ndesire. It is one which this measure, if adopted by France, forces on us\\nas necessarily as any other cause by the laws of nature brings on its\\nnecessary effect.\"\\n\\n=Louisiana Purchased.=--Acting on this belief, but apparently seeing\\nonly the Mississippi outlet at stake, Jefferson sent his friend, James\\nMonroe, to France with the power to buy New Orleans and West Florida.\\nBefore Monroe arrived, the regular minister, Livingston, had already\\nconvinced Napoleon that it would be well to sell territory which might\\nbe wrested from him at any moment by the British sea power, especially\\nas the war, temporarily stopped by the peace of Amiens, was once more\\nraging in Europe. Wise as he was in his day, Livingston had at first no\\nthought of buying the whole Louisiana country. He was simply dazed when\\nNapoleon offered to sell the entire domain and get rid of the business\\naltogether. Though staggered by the proposal, he and Monroe decided to\\naccept. On April 30, they signed the treaty of cession, agreeing to pay\\n$11,250,000 in six per cent bonds and to discharge certain debts due\\nFrench citizens, making in all approximately fifteen millions. Spain\\nprotested, Napoleon\\'s brother fumed, French newspapers objected; but the\\ndeed was done.\\n\\n=Jefferson and His Constitutional Scruples.=--When the news of this\\nextraordinary event reached the United States, the people were filled\\nwith astonishment, and no one was more surprised than Jefferson himself.\\nHe had thought of buying New Orleans and West Florida for a small sum,\\nand now a vast domain had been dumped into the lap of the nation. He was\\npuzzled. On looking into the Constitution he found not a line\\nauthorizing the purchase of more territory and so he drafted an\\namendment declaring \"Louisiana, as ceded by France,--a part of the\\nUnited States.\" He had belabored the Federalists for piling up a big\\nnational debt and he could hardly endure the thought of issuing more\\nbonds himself.\\n\\nIn the midst of his doubts came the news that Napoleon might withdraw\\nfrom the bargain. Thoroughly alarmed by that, Jefferson pressed the\\nSenate for a ratification of the treaty. He still clung to his original\\nidea that the Constitution did not warrant the purchase; but he lamely\\nconcluded: \"If our friends shall think differently, I shall certainly\\nacquiesce with satisfaction; confident that the good sense of our\\ncountry will correct the evil of construction when it shall produce ill\\neffects.\" Thus the stanch advocate of \"strict interpretation\" cut loose\\nfrom his own doctrine and intrusted the construction of the Constitution\\nto \"the good sense\" of his countrymen.\\n\\n=The Treaty Ratified.=--This unusual transaction, so favorable to the\\nWest, aroused the ire of the seaboard Federalists. Some denounced it as\\nunconstitutional, easily forgetting Hamilton\\'s masterly defense of the\\nbank, also not mentioned in the Constitution. Others urged that, if \"the\\nhowling wilderness\" ever should be settled, it would turn against the\\nEast, form new commercial connections, and escape from federal control.\\nStill others protested that the purchase would lead inevitably to the\\ndominance of a \"hotch potch of wild men from the Far West.\" Federalists,\\nwho thought \"the broad back of America\" could readily bear Hamilton\\'s\\nconsolidated debt, now went into agonies over a bond issue of less than\\none-sixth of that amount. But in vain. Jefferson\\'s party with a high\\nhand carried the day. The Senate, after hearing the Federalist protest,\\nratified the treaty. In December, 1803, the French flag was hauled down\\nfrom the old government buildings in New Orleans and the Stars and\\nStripes were hoisted as a sign that the land of Coronado, De Soto,\\nMarquette, and La Salle had passed forever to the United States.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1805]\\n\\nBy a single stroke, the original territory of the United States was more\\nthan doubled. While the boundaries of the purchase were uncertain, it is\\nsafe to say that the Louisiana territory included what is now Arkansas,\\nMissouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and large\\nportions of Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, Colorado, Montana, and\\nWyoming. The farm lands that the friends of \"a little America\" on the\\nseacoast declared a hopeless wilderness were, within a hundred years,\\nfully occupied and valued at nearly seven billion dollars--almost five\\nhundred times the price paid to Napoleon.\\n\\n=Western Explorations.=--Having taken the fateful step, Jefferson wisely\\nbegan to make the most of it. He prepared for the opening of the new\\ncountry by sending the Lewis and Clark expedition to explore it,\\ndiscover its resources, and lay out an overland route through the\\nMissouri Valley and across the Great Divide to the Pacific. The story of\\nthis mighty exploit, which began in the spring of 1804 and ended in the\\nautumn of 1806, was set down with skill and pains in the journal of\\nLewis and Clark; when published even in a short form, it invited the\\nforward-looking men of the East to take thought about the western\\nempire. At the same time Zebulon Pike, in a series of journeys, explored\\nthe sources of the Mississippi River and penetrated the Spanish\\nterritories of the far Southwest. Thus scouts and pioneers continued the\\nwork of diplomats.\\n\\n\\nTHE REPUBLICAN WAR FOR COMMERCIAL INDEPENDENCE\\n\\n=The English and French Blockades.=--In addition to bringing Louisiana\\nto the United States, the reopening of the European War in 1803, after a\\nshort lull, renewed in an acute form the commercial difficulties that\\nhad plagued the country all during the administrations of Washington and\\nAdams. The Republicans were now plunged into the hornets\\' nest. The\\nparty whose ardent spirits had burned Jay in effigy, stoned Hamilton for\\ndefending his treaty, jeered Washington\\'s proclamation of neutrality,\\nand spoken bitterly of \"timid traders,\" could no longer take refuge in\\ncriticism. It had to act.\\n\\nIts troubles took a serious turn in 1806. England, in a determined\\neffort to bring France to her knees by starvation, declared the coast of\\nEurope blockaded from Brest to the mouth of the Elbe River. Napoleon\\nretaliated by his Berlin Decree of November, 1806, blockading the\\nBritish Isles--a measure terrifying to American ship owners whose\\nvessels were liable to seizure by any French rover, though Napoleon had\\nno navy to make good his proclamation. Great Britain countered with a\\nstill more irritating decree--the Orders in Council of 1807. It modified\\nits blockade, but in so doing merely authorized American ships not\\ncarrying munitions of war to complete their voyage to the Continent, on\\ncondition of their stopping at a British port, securing a license, and\\npaying a tax. This, responded Napoleon, was the height of insolence, and\\nhe denounced it as a gross violation of international law. He then\\nclosed the circle of American troubles by issuing his Milan Decree of\\nDecember, 1807. This order declared that any ship which complied with\\nthe British rules would be subject to seizure and confiscation by French\\nauthorities.\\n\\n=The Impressment of Seamen.=--That was not all. Great Britain, in dire\\nneed of men for her navy, adopted the practice of stopping American\\nships, searching them, and carrying away British-born sailors found on\\nboard. British sailors were so badly treated, so cruelly flogged for\\ntrivial causes, and so meanly fed that they fled in crowds to the\\nAmerican marine. In many cases it was difficult to tell whether seamen\\nwere English or American. They spoke the same language, so that language\\nwas no test. Rovers on the deep and stragglers in the ports of both\\ncountries, they frequently had no papers to show their nativity.\\nMoreover, Great Britain held to the old rule--\"Once an Englishman,\\nalways an Englishman\"--a doctrine rejected by the United States in\\nfavor of the principle that a man could choose the nation to which he\\nwould give allegiance. British sea captains, sometimes by mistake, and\\noften enough with reckless indifference, carried away into servitude in\\ntheir own navy genuine American citizens. The process itself, even when\\nexecuted with all the civilities of law, was painful enough, for it\\nmeant that American ships were forced to \"come to,\" and compelled to\\nrest submissively under British guns until the searching party had pried\\ninto records, questioned seamen, seized and handcuffed victims. Saints\\ncould not have done this work without raising angry passions, and only\\nsaints could have endured it with patience and fortitude.\\n\\nHad the enactment of the scenes been confined to the high seas and\\nknowledge of them to rumors and newspaper stories, American resentment\\nmight not have been so intense; but many a search and seizure was made\\nin sight of land. British and French vessels patrolled the coasts,\\nfiring on one another and chasing one another in American waters within\\nthe three-mile limit. When, in the summer of 1807, the American frigate\\n_Chesapeake_ refused to surrender men alleged to be deserters from King\\nGeorge\\'s navy, the British warship _Leopard_ opened fire, killing three\\nmen and wounding eighteen more--an act which even the British ministry\\ncould hardly excuse. If the French were less frequently the offenders,\\nit was not because of their tenderness about American rights but because\\nso few of their ships escaped the hawk-eyed British navy to operate in\\nAmerican waters.\\n\\n=The Losses in American Commerce.=--This high-handed conduct on the part\\nof European belligerents was very injurious to American trade. By their\\nenterprise, American shippers had become the foremost carriers on the\\nAtlantic Ocean. In a decade they had doubled the tonnage of American\\nmerchant ships under the American flag, taking the place of the French\\nmarine when Britain swept that from the seas, and supplying Britain with\\nthe sinews of war for the contest with the Napoleonic empire. The\\nAmerican shipping engaged in foreign trade embraced 363,110 tons in\\n1791; 669,921 tons in 1800; and almost 1,000,000 tons in 1810. Such was\\nthe enterprise attacked by the British and French decrees. American\\nships bound for Great Britain were liable to be captured by French\\nprivateers which, in spite of the disasters of the Nile and Trafalgar,\\nranged the seas. American ships destined for the Continent, if they\\nfailed to stop at British ports and pay tribute, were in great danger of\\ncapture by the sleepless British navy and its swarm of auxiliaries.\\nAmerican sea captains who, in fear of British vengeance, heeded the\\nOrders in Council and paid the tax were almost certain to fall a prey to\\nFrench vengeance, for the French were vigorous in executing the Milan\\nDecree.\\n\\n=Jefferson\\'s Policy.=--The President\\'s dilemma was distressing. Both the\\nbelligerents in Europe were guilty of depredations on American commerce.\\nWar on both of them was out of the question. War on France was\\nimpossible because she had no territory on this side of the water which\\ncould be reached by American troops and her naval forces had been\\nshattered at the battles of the Nile and Trafalgar. War on Great\\nBritain, a power which Jefferson\\'s followers feared and distrusted, was\\npossible but not inviting. Jefferson shrank from it. A man of peace, he\\ndisliked war\\'s brazen clamor; a man of kindly spirit, he was startled at\\nthe death and destruction which it brought in its train. So for the\\neight years Jefferson steered an even course, suggesting measure after\\nmeasure with a view to avoiding bloodshed. He sent, it is true,\\nCommodore Preble in 1803 to punish Mediterranean pirates preying upon\\nAmerican commerce; but a great war he evaded with passionate\\nearnestness, trying in its place every other expedient to protect\\nAmerican rights.\\n\\n=The Embargo and Non-intercourse Acts.=--In 1806, Congress passed and\\nJefferson approved a non-importation act closing American ports to\\ncertain products from British dominions--a measure intended as a club\\nover the British government\\'s head. This law, failing in its purpose,\\nJefferson proposed and Congress adopted in December, 1807, the Embargo\\nAct forbidding all vessels to leave American harbors for foreign ports.\\nFrance and England were to be brought to terms by cutting off their\\nsupplies.\\n\\nThe result of the embargo was pathetic. England and France refused to\\ngive up search and seizure. American ship owners who, lured by huge\\nprofits, had formerly been willing to take the risk were now restrained\\nby law to their home ports. Every section suffered. The South and West\\nfound their markets for cotton, rice, tobacco, corn, and bacon\\ncurtailed. Thus they learned by bitter experience the national\\nsignificance of commerce. Ship masters, ship builders, longshoremen, and\\nsailors were thrown out of employment while the prices of foreign goods\\ndoubled. Those who obeyed the law were ruined; violators of the law\\nsmuggled goods into Canada and Florida for shipment abroad.\\n\\nJefferson\\'s friends accepted the medicine with a wry face as the only\\nalternative to supine submission or open war. His opponents, without\\noffering any solution of their own, denounced it as a contemptible plan\\nthat brought neither relief nor honor. Beset by the clamor that arose on\\nall sides, Congress, in the closing days of Jefferson\\'s administration,\\nrepealed the Embargo law and substituted a Non-intercourse act\\nforbidding trade with England and France while permitting it with other\\ncountries--a measure equally futile in staying the depredations on\\nAmerican shipping.\\n\\n=Jefferson Retires in Favor of Madison.=--Jefferson, exhausted by\\nendless wrangling and wounded, as Washington had been, by savage\\ncriticism, welcomed March 4, 1809. His friends urged him to \"stay by the\\nship\" and accept a third term. He declined, saying that election for\\nlife might result from repeated reelection. In following Washington\\'s\\ncourse and defending it on principle, he set an example to all his\\nsuccessors, making the \"third term doctrine\" a part of American\\nunwritten law.\\n\\nHis intimate friend, James Madison, to whom he turned over the burdens\\nof his high office was, like himself, a man of peace. Madison had been a\\nleader since the days of the Revolution, but in legislative halls and\\ncouncil chambers, not on the field of battle. Small in stature,\\nsensitive in feelings, studious in habits, he was no man for the rough\\nand tumble of practical politics. He had taken a prominent and\\ndistinguished part in the framing and the adoption of the Constitution.\\nHe had served in the first Congress as a friend of Hamilton\\'s measures.\\nLater he attached himself to Jefferson\\'s fortunes and served for eight\\nyears as his first counselor, the Secretary of State. The principles of\\nthe Constitution, which he had helped to make and interpret, he was now\\nas President called upon to apply in one of the most perplexing moments\\nin all American history. In keeping with his own traditions and\\nfollowing in the footsteps of Jefferson, he vainly tried to solve the\\nforeign problem by negotiation.\\n\\n=The Trend of Events.=--Whatever difficulties Madison had in making up\\nhis mind on war and peace were settled by events beyond his own control.\\nIn the spring of 1811, a British frigate held up an American ship near\\nthe harbor of New York and impressed a seaman alleged to be an American\\ncitizen. Burning with resentment, the captain of the _President_, an\\nAmerican warship, acting under orders, poured several broadsides into\\nthe _Little Belt_, a British sloop, suspected of being the guilty party.\\nThe British also encouraged the Indian chief Tecumseh, who welded\\ntogether the Indians of the Northwest under British protection and gave\\nsigns of restlessness presaging a revolt. This sent a note of alarm\\nalong the frontier that was not checked even when, in November,\\nTecumseh\\'s men were badly beaten at Tippecanoe by William Henry\\nHarrison. The Indians stood in the way of the advancing frontier, and it\\nseemed to the pioneers that, without support from the British in Canada,\\nthe Red Men would soon be subdued.\\n\\n=Clay and Calhoun.=--While events were moving swiftly and rumors were\\nflying thick and fast, the mastery of the government passed from the\\nuncertain hands of Madison to a party of ardent young men in Congress,\\ndubbed \"Young Republicans,\" under the leadership of two members destined\\nto be mighty figures in American history: Henry Clay of Kentucky and\\nJohn C. Calhoun of South Carolina. The former contended, in a flair of\\nfolly, that \"the militia of Kentucky alone are competent to place\\nMontreal and Upper Canada at your feet.\" The latter with a light heart\\nspoke of conquering Canada in a four weeks\\' campaign. \"It must not be\\ninferred,\" says Channing, \"that in advocating conquest, the Westerners\\nwere actuated merely by desire for land; they welcomed war because they\\n\\nthought it would be the easiest way to abate Indian troubles. The\\nsavages were supported by the fur-trading interests that centred at\\nQuebec and London.... The Southerners on their part wished for Florida\\nand they thought that the conquest of Canada would obviate some Northern\\nopposition to this acquisition of slave territory.\" While Clay and\\nCalhoun, spokesmen of the West and South, were not unmindful of what\\nNapoleon had done to American commerce, they knew that their followers\\nstill remembered with deep gratitude the aid of the French in the war\\nfor independence and that the embers of the old hatred for George III,\\nstill on the throne, could be readily blown into flame.\\n\\n=Madison Accepts War as Inevitable.=--The conduct of the British\\nministers with whom Madison had to deal did little to encourage him in\\nadhering to the policy of \"watchful waiting.\" One of them, a high Tory,\\nbelieved that all Americans were alike \"except that a few are less\\nknaves than others\" and his methods were colored by his belief. On the\\nrecall of this minister the British government selected another no less\\nhigh and mighty in his principles and opinions. So Madison became\\nthoroughly discouraged about the outcome of pacific measures. When the\\npressure from Congress upon him became too heavy, he gave way, signing\\non June 18, 1812, the declaration of war on Great Britain. In\\nproclaiming hostilities, the administration set forth the causes which\\njustified the declaration; namely, the British had been encouraging the\\nIndians to attack American citizens on the frontier; they had ruined\\nAmerican trade by blockades; they had insulted the American flag by\\nstopping and searching our ships; they had illegally seized American\\nsailors and driven them into the British navy.\\n\\n=The Course of the War.=--The war lasted for nearly three years without\\nbringing victory to either side. The surrender of Detroit by General\\nHull to the British and the failure of the American invasion of Canada\\nwere offset by Perry\\'s victory on Lake Erie and a decisive blow\\nadministered to British designs for an invasion of New York by way of\\nPlattsburgh. The triumph of Jackson at New Orleans helped to atone for\\nthe humiliation suffered in the burning of the Capitol by the British.\\nThe stirring deeds of the _Constitution_, the _United States_, and the\\n_Argus_ on the seas, the heroic death of Lawrence and the victories of a\\nhundred privateers furnished consolation for those who suffered from the\\niron blockade finally established by the British government when it came\\nto appreciate the gravity of the situation. While men love the annals of\\nthe sea, they will turn to the running battles, the narrow escapes, and\\nthe reckless daring of American sailors in that naval contest with Great\\nBritain.\\n\\nAll this was exciting but it was inconclusive. In fact, never was a\\ngovernment less prepared than was that of the United States in 1812. It\\nhad neither the disciplined troops, the ships of war, nor the supplies\\nrequired by the magnitude of the military task. It was fortune that\\nfavored the American cause. Great Britain, harassed, worn, and\\nfinancially embarrassed by nearly twenty years of fighting in Europe,\\nwas in no mood to gather her forces for a titanic effort in America even\\nafter Napoleon was overthrown and sent into exile at Elba in the spring\\nof 1814. War clouds still hung on the European horizon and the conflict\\ntemporarily halted did again break out. To be rid of American anxieties\\nand free for European eventualities, England was ready to settle with\\nthe United States, especially as that could be done without conceding\\nanything or surrendering any claims.\\n\\n=The Treaty of Peace.=--Both countries were in truth sick of a war that\\noffered neither glory nor profit. Having indulged in the usual\\ndiplomatic skirmishing, they sent representatives to Ghent to discuss\\nterms of peace. After long negotiations an agreement was reached on\\nChristmas eve, 1814, a few days before Jackson\\'s victory at New Orleans.\\nWhen the treaty reached America the people were surprised to find that\\nit said nothing about the seizure of American sailors, the destruction\\nof American trade, the searching of American ships, or the support of\\nIndians on the frontier. Nevertheless, we are told, the people \"passed\\nfrom gloom to glory\" when the news of peace arrived. The bells were\\nrung; schools were closed; flags were displayed; and many a rousing\\ntoast was drunk in tavern and private home. The rejoicing could\\ncontinue. With Napoleon definitely beaten at Waterloo in June, 1815,\\nGreat Britain had no need to impress sailors, search ships, and\\nconfiscate American goods bound to the Continent. Once more the terrible\\nsea power sank into the background and the ocean was again white with\\nthe sails of merchantmen.\\n\\n\\nTHE REPUBLICANS NATIONALIZED\\n\\n=The Federalists Discredited.=--By a strange turn of fortune\\'s wheel,\\nthe party of Hamilton, Washington, Adams, the party of the grand nation,\\nbecame the party of provincialism and nullification. New England,\\nfinding its shipping interests crippled in the European conflict and\\nthen penalized by embargoes, opposed the declaration of war on Great\\nBritain, which meant the completion of the ruin already begun. In the\\ncourse of the struggle, the Federalist leaders came perilously near to\\ntreason in their efforts to hamper the government of the United States;\\nand in their desperation they fell back upon the doctrine of\\nnullification so recently condemned by them when it came from Kentucky.\\nThe Senate of Massachusetts, while the war was in progress, resolved\\nthat it was waged \"without justifiable cause,\" and refused to approve\\nmilitary and naval projects not connected with \"the defense of our\\nseacoast and soil.\" A Boston newspaper declared that the union was\\nnothing but a treaty among sovereign states, that states could decide\\nfor themselves the question of obeying federal law, and that armed\\nresistance under the banner of a state would not be rebellion or\\ntreason. The general assembly of Connecticut reminded the administration\\nat Washington that \"the state of Connecticut is a free, sovereign, and\\nindependent state.\" Gouverneur Morris, a member of the convention which\\nhad drafted the Constitution, suggested the holding of another\\nconference to consider whether the Northern states should remain in the\\nunion.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old cartoon_\\n\\nNEW ENGLAND JUMPING INTO THE HANDS OF GEORGE III]\\n\\nIn October, 1814, a convention of delegates from Connecticut,\\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, and certain counties of New Hampshire and\\nVermont was held at Hartford, on the call of Massachusetts. The counsels\\nof the extremists were rejected but the convention solemnly went on\\nrecord to the effect that acts of Congress in violation of the\\nConstitution are void; that in cases of deliberate, dangerous, and\\npalpable infractions the state is duty bound to interpose its authority\\nfor the protection of its citizens; and that when emergencies occur the\\nstates must be their own judges and execute their own decisions. Thus\\nNew England answered the challenge of Calhoun and Clay. Fortunately its\\nactions were not as rash as its words. The Hartford convention merely\\nproposed certain amendments to the Constitution and adjourned. At the\\nclose of the war, its proposals vanished harmlessly; but the men who\\nmade them were hopelessly discredited.\\n\\n=The Second United States Bank.=--In driving the Federalists towards\\nnullification and waging a national war themselves, the Republicans lost\\nall their old taint of provincialism. Moreover, in turning to measures\\nof reconstruction called forth by the war, they resorted to the national\\ndevices of the Federalists. In 1816, they chartered for a period of\\ntwenty years a second United States Bank--the institution which\\nJefferson and Madison once had condemned as unsound and\\nunconstitutional. The Constitution remained unchanged; times and\\ncircumstances had changed. Calhoun dismissed the vexed question of\\nconstitutionality with a scant reference to an ancient dispute, while\\nMadison set aside his scruples and signed the bill.\\n\\n=The Protective Tariff of 1816.=--The Republicans supplemented the Bank\\nby another Federalist measure--a high protective tariff. Clay viewed it\\nas the beginning of his \"American system\" of protection. Calhoun\\ndefended it on national principles. For this sudden reversal of policy\\nthe young Republicans were taunted by some of their older party\\ncolleagues with betraying the \"agricultural interest\" that Jefferson had\\nfostered; but Calhoun refused to listen to their criticisms. \"When the\\nseas are open,\" he said, \"the produce of the South may pour anywhere\\ninto the markets of the Old World.... What are the effects of a war with\\na maritime power--with England? Our commerce annihilated ... our\\nagriculture cut off from its accustomed markets, the surplus of the\\nfarmer perishes on his hands.... The recent war fell with peculiar\\npressure on the growers of cotton and tobacco and the other great\\nstaples of the country; and the same state of things will recur in the\\nevent of another war unless prevented by the foresight of this body....\\nWhen our manufactures are grown to a certain perfection, as they soon\\nwill be under the fostering care of the government, we shall no longer\\nexperience these evils.\" With the Republicans nationalized, the\\nFederalist party, as an organization, disappeared after a crushing\\ndefeat in the presidential campaign of 1816.\\n\\n=Monroe and the Florida Purchase.=--To the victor in that political\\ncontest, James Monroe of Virginia, fell two tasks of national\\nimportance, adding to the prestige of the whole country and deepening\\nthe sense of patriotism that weaned men away from mere allegiance to\\nstates. The first of these was the purchase of Florida from Spain. The\\nacquisition of Louisiana let the Mississippi flow \"unvexed to the sea\";\\nbut it left all the states east of the river cut off from the Gulf,\\naffording them ground for discontent akin to that which had moved the\\npioneers of Kentucky to action a generation earlier. The uncertainty as\\nto the boundaries of Louisiana gave the United States a claim to West\\nFlorida, setting on foot a movement for occupation. The Florida swamps\\nwere a basis for Indian marauders who periodically swept into the\\nfrontier settlements, and hiding places for runaway slaves. Thus the\\nsanction of international law was given to punitive expeditions into\\nalien territory.\\n\\nThe pioneer leaders stood waiting for the signal. It came. President\\nMonroe, on the occasion of an Indian outbreak, ordered General Jackson\\nto seize the offenders, in the Floridas, if necessary. The high-spirited\\nwarrior, taking this as a hint that he was to occupy the coveted region,\\nreplied that, if possession was the object of the invasion, he could\\noccupy the Floridas within sixty days. Without waiting for an answer to\\nthis letter, he launched his expedition, and in the spring of 1818 was\\nmaster of the Spanish king\\'s domain to the south.\\n\\nThere was nothing for the king to do but to make the best of the\\ninevitable by ceding the Floridas to the United States in return for\\nfive million dollars to be paid to American citizens having claims\\nagainst Spain. On Washington\\'s birthday, 1819, the treaty was signed. It\\nceded the Floridas to the United States and defined the boundary between\\nMexico and the United States by drawing a line from the mouth of the\\nSabine River in a northwesterly direction to the Pacific. On this\\noccasion even Monroe, former opponent of the Constitution, forgot to\\ninquire whether new territory could be constitutionally acquired and\\nincorporated into the American union. The Republicans seemed far away\\nfrom the days of \"strict construction.\" And Jefferson still lived!\\n\\n=The Monroe Doctrine.=--Even more effective in fashioning the national\\nidea was Monroe\\'s enunciation of the famous doctrine that bears his\\nname. The occasion was another European crisis. During the Napoleonic\\nupheaval and the years of dissolution that ensued, the Spanish colonies\\nin America, following the example set by their English neighbors in\\n1776, declared their independence. Unable to conquer them alone, the\\nking of Spain turned for help to the friendly powers of Europe that\\nlooked upon revolution and republics with undisguised horror.\\n\\n_The Holy Alliance._--He found them prepared to view his case with\\nsympathy. Three of them, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, under the\\nleadership of the Czar, Alexander I, in the autumn of 1815, had entered\\ninto a Holy Alliance to sustain by reciprocal service the autocratic\\nprinciple in government. Although the effusive, almost maudlin, language\\nof the treaty did not express their purpose explicitly, the Alliance was\\nlater regarded as a mere union of monarchs to prevent the rise and\\ngrowth of popular government.\\n\\nThe American people thought their worst fears confirmed when, in 1822, a\\nconference of delegates from Russia, Austria, Prussia, and France met at\\nVerona to consider, among other things, revolutions that had just broken\\nout in Spain and Italy. The spirit of the conference is reflected in the\\nfirst article of the agreement reached by the delegates: \"The high\\ncontracting powers, being convinced that the system of representative\\ngovernment is equally incompatible with the monarchical principle and\\nthe maxim of the sovereignty of the people with the divine right,\\nmutually engage in the most solemn manner to use all their efforts to\\nput an end to the system of representative government in whatever\\ncountry it may exist in Europe and to prevent its being introduced in\\nthose countries where it is not yet known.\" The Czar, who incidentally\\ncoveted the west coast of North America, proposed to send an army to aid\\nthe king of Spain in his troubles at home, thus preparing the way for\\nintervention in Spanish America. It was material weakness not want of\\nspirit, that prevented the grand union of monarchs from making open war\\non popular government.\\n\\n_The Position of England._--Unfortunately, too, for the Holy Alliance,\\nEngland refused to cooperate. English merchants had built up a large\\ntrade with the independent Latin-American colonies and they protested\\nagainst the restoration of Spanish sovereignty, which meant a renewal of\\nSpain\\'s former trade monopoly. Moreover, divine right doctrines had been\\nlaid to rest in England and the representative principle thoroughly\\nestablished. Already there were signs of the coming democratic flood\\nwhich was soon to carry the first reform bill of 1832, extending the\\nsuffrage, and sweep on to even greater achievements. British statesmen,\\ntherefore, had to be cautious. In such circumstances, instead of\\ncooperating with the autocrats of Russia, Austria, and Prussia, they\\nturned to the minister of the United States in London. The British prime\\nminister, Canning, proposed that the two countries join in declaring\\ntheir unwillingness to see the Spanish colonies transferred to any other\\npower.\\n\\n_Jefferson\\'s Advice._--The proposal was rejected; but President Monroe\\ntook up the suggestion with Madison and Jefferson as well as with his\\nSecretary of State, John Quincy Adams. They favored the plan. Jefferson\\nsaid: \"One nation, most of all, could disturb us in this pursuit [of\\nfreedom]; she now offers to lead, aid, and accompany us in it. By\\nacceding to her proposition we detach her from the bands, bring her\\nmighty weight into the scale of free government and emancipate a\\ncontinent at one stroke.... With her on our side we need not fear the\\nwhole world. With her then we should most sedulously cherish a cordial\\nfriendship.\"\\n\\n_Monroe\\'s Statement of the Doctrine._--Acting on the advice of trusted\\nfriends, President Monroe embodied in his message to Congress, on\\nDecember 2, 1823, a statement of principles now famous throughout the\\nworld as the Monroe Doctrine. To the autocrats of Europe he announced\\nthat he would regard \"any attempt on their part to extend their system\\nto any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety.\"\\nWhile he did not propose to interfere with existing colonies dependent\\non European powers, he ranged himself squarely on the side of those that\\nhad declared their independence. Any attempt by a European power to\\noppress them or control their destiny in any manner he characterized as\\n\"a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States.\"\\nReferring in another part of his message to a recent claim which the\\nCzar had made to the Pacific coast, President Monroe warned the Old\\nWorld that \"the American continents, by the free and independent\\ncondition which they have assumed and maintained, are henceforth not to\\nbe considered as subjects for future colonization by any European\\npowers.\" The effect of this declaration was immediate and profound. Men\\nwhose political horizon had been limited to a community or state were\\nled to consider their nation as a great power among the sovereignties of\\nthe earth, taking its part in shaping their international relations.\\n\\n=The Missouri Compromise.=--Respecting one other important measure of\\nthis period, the Republicans also took a broad view of their obligations\\nunder the Constitution; namely, the Missouri Compromise. It is true,\\nthey insisted on the admission of Missouri as a slave state, balanced\\nagainst the free state of Maine; but at the same time they assented to\\nthe prohibition of slavery in the Louisiana territory north of the line\\n36 o 30\\'. During the debate on the subject an extreme view had been\\npresented, to the effect that Congress had no constitutional warrant for\\nabolishing slavery in the territories. The precedent of the Northwest\\nOrdinance, ratified by Congress in 1789, seemed a conclusive answer from\\npractice to this contention; but Monroe submitted the issue to his\\ncabinet, which included Calhoun of South Carolina, Crawford of Georgia,\\nand Wirt of Virginia, all presumably adherents to the Jeffersonian\\nprinciple of strict construction. He received in reply a unanimous\\nverdict to the effect that Congress did have the power to prohibit\\nslavery in the territories governed by it. Acting on this advice he\\napproved, on March 6, 1820, the bill establishing freedom north of the\\ncompromise line. This generous interpretation of the powers of Congress\\nstood for nearly forty years, until repudiated by the Supreme Court in\\nthe Dred Scott case.\\n\\n\\nTHE NATIONAL DECISIONS OF CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL\\n\\n=John Marshall, the Nationalist.=--The Republicans in the lower ranges\\nof state politics, who did not catch the grand national style of their\\nleaders charged with responsibilities in the national field, were\\nassisted in their education by a Federalist from the Old Dominion, John\\nMarshall, who, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United\\nStates from 1801 to 1835, lost no occasion to exalt the Constitution\\nabove the claims of the provinces. No differences of opinion as to his\\npolitical views have ever led even his warmest opponents to deny his\\nsuperb abilities or his sincere devotion to the national idea. All will\\nlikewise agree that for talents, native and acquired, he was an ornament\\nto the humble democracy that brought him forth. His whole career was\\nAmerican. Born on the frontier of Virginia, reared in a log cabin,\\ngranted only the barest rudiments of education, inured to hardship and\\nrough life, he rose by masterly efforts to the highest judicial honor\\nAmerica can bestow.\\n\\nOn him the bitter experience of the Revolution and of later days made a\\nlasting impression. He was no \"summer patriot.\" He had been a soldier in\\nthe Revolutionary army. He had suffered with Washington at Valley Forge.\\nHe had seen his comrades in arms starving and freezing because the\\nContinental Congress had neither the power nor the inclination to force\\nthe states to do their full duty. To him the Articles of Confederation\\nwere the symbol of futility. Into the struggle for the formation of the\\nConstitution and its ratification in Virginia he had thrown himself with\\nthe ardor of a soldier. Later, as a member of Congress, a representative\\nto France, and Secretary of State, he had aided the Federalists in\\nestablishing the new government. When at length they were driven from\\npower in the executive and legislative branches of the government, he\\nwas chosen for their last stronghold, the Supreme Court. By historic\\nirony he administered the oath of office to his bitterest enemy, Thomas\\nJefferson; and, long after the author of the Declaration of Independence\\nhad retired to private life, the stern Chief Justice continued to\\nannounce the old Federalist principles from the Supreme Bench.\\n\\n[Illustration: JOHN MARSHALL]\\n\\n=Marbury _vs._ Madison--An Act of Congress Annulled.=--He had been in\\nhis high office only two years when he laid down for the first time in\\nthe name of the entire Court the doctrine that the judges have the power\\nto declare an act of Congress null and void when in their opinion it\\nviolates the Constitution. This power was not expressly conferred on the\\nCourt. Though many able men held that the judicial branch of the\\ngovernment enjoyed it, the principle was not positively established\\nuntil 1803 when the case of Marbury _vs._ Madison was decided. In\\nrendering the opinion of the Court, Marshall cited no precedents. He\\nsought no foundations for his argument in ancient history. He rested it\\non the general nature of the American system. The Constitution, ran his\\nreasoning, is the supreme law of the land; it limits and binds all who\\nact in the name of the United States; it limits the powers of Congress\\nand defines the rights of citizens. If Congress can ignore its\\nlimitations and trespass upon the rights of citizens, Marshall argued,\\nthen the Constitution disappears and Congress is supreme. Since,\\nhowever, the Constitution is supreme and superior to Congress, it is the\\nduty of judges, under their oath of office, to sustain it against\\nmeasures which violate it. Therefore, from the nature of the American\\nconstitutional system the courts must declare null and void all acts\\nwhich are not authorized. \"A law repugnant to the Constitution,\" he\\nclosed, \"is void and the courts as well as other departments are bound\\nby that instrument.\" From that day to this the practice of federal and\\nstate courts in passing upon the constitutionality of laws has remained\\nunshaken.\\n\\nThis doctrine was received by Jefferson and many of his followers with\\nconsternation. If the idea was sound, he exclaimed, \"then indeed is our\\nConstitution a complete _felo de se_ [legally, a suicide]. For,\\nintending to establish three departments, coordinate and independent\\nthat they might check and balance one another, it has given, according\\nto this opinion, to one of them alone the right to prescribe rules for\\nthe government of the others, and to that one, too, which is unelected\\nby and independent of the nation.... The Constitution, on this\\nhypothesis, is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary which\\nthey may twist and shape into any form they please. It should be\\nremembered, as an axiom of eternal truth in politics, that whatever\\npower in any government is independent, is absolute also.... A judiciary\\nindependent of a king or executive alone is a good thing; but\\nindependence of the will of the nation is a solecism, at least in a\\nrepublican government.\" But Marshall was mighty and his view prevailed,\\nthough from time to time other men, clinging to Jefferson\\'s opinion,\\nlikewise opposed the exercise by the Courts of the high power of passing\\nupon the constitutionality of acts of Congress.\\n\\n=Acts of State Legislatures Declared Unconstitutional.=--Had Marshall\\nstopped with annulling an act of Congress, he would have heard less\\ncriticism from Republican quarters; but, with the same firmness, he set\\naside acts of state legislatures as well, whenever, in his opinion, they\\nviolated the federal Constitution. In 1810, in the case of Fletcher\\n_vs._ Peck, he annulled an act of the Georgia legislature, informing the\\nstate that it was not sovereign, but \"a part of a large empire, ... a\\nmember of the American union; and that union has a constitution ...\\nwhich imposes limits to the legislatures of the several states.\" In the\\ncase of McCulloch _vs._ Maryland, decided in 1819, he declared void an\\nact of the Maryland legislature designed to paralyze the branches of the\\nUnited States Bank established in that state. In the same year, in the\\nstill more memorable Dartmouth College case, he annulled an act of the\\nNew Hampshire legislature which infringed upon the charter received by\\nthe college from King George long before. That charter, he declared, was\\na contract between the state and the college, which the legislature\\nunder the federal Constitution could not impair. Two years later he\\nstirred the wrath of Virginia by summoning her to the bar of the Supreme\\nCourt to answer in a case in which the validity of one of her laws was\\ninvolved and then justified his action in a powerful opinion rendered in\\nthe case of Cohens _vs._ Virginia.\\n\\nAll these decisions aroused the legislatures of the states. They passed\\nsheaves of resolutions protesting and condemning; but Marshall never\\nturned and never stayed. The Constitution of the United States, he\\nfairly thundered at them, is the supreme law of the land; the Supreme\\nCourt is the proper tribunal to pass finally upon the validity of the\\nlaws of the states; and \"those sovereignties,\" far from possessing the\\nright of review and nullification, are irrevocably bound by the\\ndecisions of that Court. This was strong medicine for the authors of the\\nKentucky and Virginia Resolutions and for the members of the Hartford\\nconvention; but they had to take it.\\n\\n=The Doctrine of Implied Powers.=--While restraining Congress in the\\nMarbury case and the state legislatures in a score of cases, Marshall\\nalso laid the judicial foundation for a broad and liberal view of the\\nConstitution as opposed to narrow and strict construction. In McCulloch\\n_vs._ Maryland, he construed generously the words \"necessary and proper\"\\nin such a way as to confer upon Congress a wide range of \"implied\\npowers\" in addition to their express powers. That case involved, among\\nother things, the question whether the act establishing the second\\nUnited States Bank was authorized by the Constitution. Marshall answered\\nin the affirmative. Congress, ran his reasoning, has large powers over\\ntaxation and the currency; a bank is of appropriate use in the exercise\\nof these enumerated powers; and therefore, though not absolutely\\nnecessary, a bank is entirely proper and constitutional. \"With respect\\nto the means by which the powers that the Constitution confers are to be\\ncarried into execution,\" he said, Congress must be allowed the\\ndiscretion which \"will enable that body to perform the high duties\\nassigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people.\" In short,\\nthe Constitution of the United States is not a strait jacket but a\\nflexible instrument vesting in Congress the powers necessary to meet\\nnational problems as they arise. In delivering this opinion Marshall\\nused language almost identical with that employed by Lincoln when,\\nstanding on the battle field of a war waged to preserve the nation, he\\nsaid that \"a government of the people, by the people, for the people\\nshall not perish from the earth.\"\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY OF THE UNION AND NATIONAL POLITICS\\n\\nDuring the strenuous period between the establishment of American\\nindependence and the advent of Jacksonian democracy the great American\\nexperiment was under the direction of the men who had launched it. All\\nthe Presidents in that period, except John Quincy Adams, had taken part\\nin the Revolution. James Madison, the chief author of the Constitution,\\nlived until 1836. This age, therefore, was the \"age of the fathers.\" It\\nsaw the threatened ruin of the country under the Articles of\\nConfederation, the formation of the Constitution, the rise of political\\nparties, the growth of the West, the second war with England, and the\\napparent triumph of the national spirit over sectionalism.\\n\\nThe new republic had hardly been started in 1783 before its troubles\\nbegan. The government could not raise money to pay its debts or running\\nexpenses; it could not protect American commerce and manufactures\\nagainst European competition; it could not stop the continual issues of\\npaper money by the states; it could not intervene to put down domestic\\nuprisings that threatened the existence of the state governments.\\nWithout money, without an army, without courts of law, the union under\\nthe Articles of Confederation was drifting into dissolution. Patriots,\\nwho had risked their lives for independence, began to talk of monarchy\\nagain. Washington, Hamilton, and Madison insisted that a new\\nconstitution alone could save America from disaster.\\n\\nBy dint of much labor the friends of a new form of government induced\\nthe Congress to call a national convention to take into account the\\nstate of America. In May, 1787, it assembled at Philadelphia and for\\nmonths it debated and wrangled over plans for a constitution. The small\\nstates clamored for equal rights in the union. The large states vowed\\nthat they would never grant it. A spirit of conciliation, fair play, and\\ncompromise saved the convention from breaking up. In addition, there\\nwere jealousies between the planting states and the commercial states.\\nHere, too, compromises had to be worked out. Some of the delegates\\nfeared the growth of democracy and others cherished it. These factions\\nalso had to be placated. At last a plan of government was drafted--the\\nConstitution of the United States--and submitted to the states for\\napproval. Only after a long and acrimonious debate did enough states\\nratify the instrument to put it into effect. On April 30, 1789, George\\nWashington was inaugurated first President.\\n\\nThe new government proceeded to fund the old debt of the nation, assume\\nthe debts of the states, found a national bank, lay heavy taxes to pay\\nthe bills, and enact laws protecting American industry and commerce.\\nHamilton led the way, but he had not gone far before he encountered\\nopposition. He found a formidable antagonist in Jefferson. In time two\\npolitical parties appeared full armed upon the scene: the Federalists\\nand the Republicans. For ten years they filled the country with\\npolitical debate. In 1800 the Federalists were utterly vanquished by the\\nRepublicans with Jefferson in the lead.\\n\\nBy their proclamations of faith the Republicans favored the states\\nrather than the new national government, but in practice they added\\nimmensely to the prestige and power of the nation. They purchased\\nLouisiana from France, they waged a war for commercial independence\\nagainst England, they created a second United States Bank, they enacted\\nthe protective tariff of 1816, they declared that Congress had power to\\nabolish slavery north of the Missouri Compromise line, and they spread\\nthe shield of the Monroe Doctrine between the Western Hemisphere and\\nEurope.\\n\\nStill America was a part of European civilization. Currents of opinion\\nflowed to and fro across the Atlantic. Friends of popular government in\\nEurope looked to America as the great exemplar of their ideals. Events\\nin Europe reacted upon thought in the United States. The French\\nRevolution exerted a profound influence on the course of political\\ndebate. While it was in the stage of mere reform all Americans favored\\nit. When the king was executed and a radical democracy set up, American\\nopinion was divided. When France fell under the military dominion of\\nNapoleon and preyed upon American commerce, the United States made ready\\nfor war.\\n\\nThe conduct of England likewise affected American affairs. In 1793 war\\nbroke out between England and France and raged with only a slight\\nintermission until 1815. England and France both ravaged American\\ncommerce, but England was the more serious offender because she had\\ncommand of the seas. Though Jefferson and Madison strove for peace, the\\ncountry was swept into war by the vehemence of the \"Young Republicans,\"\\nheaded by Clay and Calhoun.\\n\\nWhen the armed conflict was closed, one in diplomacy opened. The\\nautocratic powers of Europe threatened to intervene on behalf of Spain\\nin her attempt to recover possession of her Latin-American colonies.\\nTheir challenge to America brought forth the Monroe Doctrine. The powers\\nof Europe were warned not to interfere with the independence or the\\nrepublican policies of this hemisphere or to attempt any new\\ncolonization in it. It seemed that nationalism was to have a peaceful\\ntriumph over sectionalism.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nH. Adams, _History of the United States, 1800-1817_ (9 vols.).\\n\\nK.C.

THE WEST AND JACKSONIAN DEMOCRACY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nTHE FARMERS BEYOND THE APPALACHIANS\\n\\n\\nThe nationalism of Hamilton was undemocratic. The democracy of Jefferson\\nwas, in the beginning, provincial. The historic mission of uniting\\nnationalism and democracy was in the course of time given to new leaders\\nfrom a region beyond the mountains, peopled by men and women from all\\nsections and free from those state traditions which ran back to the\\nearly days of colonization. The voice of the democratic nationalism\\nnourished in the West was heard when Clay of Kentucky advocated his\\nAmerican system of protection for industries; when Jackson of Tennessee\\ncondemned nullification in a ringing proclamation that has taken its\\nplace among the great American state papers; and when Lincoln of\\nIllinois, in a fateful hour, called upon a bewildered people to meet the\\nsupreme test whether this was a nation destined to survive or to perish.\\nAnd it will be remembered that Lincoln\\'s party chose for its banner that\\nearlier device--Republican--which Jefferson had made a sign of power.\\nThe \"rail splitter\" from Illinois united the nationalism of Hamilton\\nwith the democracy of Jefferson, and his appeal was clothed in the\\nsimple language of the people, not in the sonorous rhetoric which\\nWebster learned in the schools.\\n\\n\\nPREPARATION FOR WESTERN SETTLEMENT\\n\\n=The West and the American Revolution.=--The excessive attention devoted\\nby historians to the military operations along the coast has obscured\\nthe role played by the frontier in the American Revolution. The action\\nof Great Britain in closing western land to easy settlement in 1763 was\\nmore than an incident in precipitating the war for independence.\\nAmericans on the frontier did not forget it; when Indians were employed\\nby England to defend that land, zeal for the patriot cause set the\\ninterior aflame. It was the members of the western vanguard, like Daniel\\nBoone, John Sevier, and George Rogers Clark, who first understood the\\nvalue of the far-away country under the guns of the English forts, where\\nthe Red Men still wielded the tomahawk and the scalping knife. It was\\nthey who gave the East no rest until their vision was seen by the\\nleaders on the seaboard who directed the course of national policy. It\\nwas one of their number, a seasoned Indian fighter, George Rogers Clark,\\nwho with aid from Virginia seized Kaskaskia and Vincennes and secured\\nthe whole Northwest to the union while the fate of Washington\\'s army was\\nstill hanging in the balance.\\n\\n=Western Problems at the End of the Revolution.=--The treaty of peace,\\nsigned with Great Britain in 1783, brought the definite cession of the\\ncoveted territory west to the Mississippi River, but it left unsolved\\nmany problems. In the first place, tribes of resentful Indians in the\\nOhio region, even though British support was withdrawn at last, had to\\nbe reckoned with; and it was not until after the establishment of the\\nfederal Constitution that a well-equipped army could be provided to\\nguarantee peace on the border. In the second place, British garrisons\\nstill occupied forts on Lake Erie pending the execution of the terms of\\nthe treaty of 1783--terms which were not fulfilled until after the\\nratification of the Jay treaty twelve years later. In the third place,\\nVirginia, Connecticut, and Massachusetts had conflicting claims to the\\nland in the Northwest based on old English charters and Indian treaties.\\nIt was only after a bitter contest that the states reached an agreement\\nto transfer their rights to the government of the United States,\\nVirginia executing her deed of cession on March 1, 1784. In the fourth\\nplace, titles to lands bought by individuals remained uncertain in the\\nabsence of official maps and records. To meet this last situation,\\nCongress instituted a systematic survey of the Ohio country, laying it\\nout into townships, sections of 640 acres each, and quarter sections. In\\nevery township one section of land was set aside for the support of\\npublic schools.\\n\\n=The Northwest Ordinance.=--The final problem which had to be solved\\nbefore settlement on a large scale could be begun was that of governing\\nthe territory. Pioneers who looked with hungry eyes on the fertile\\nvalley of the Ohio could hardly restrain their impatience. Soldiers of\\nthe Revolution, who had been paid for their services in land warrants\\nentitling them to make entries in the West, called for action.\\n\\nCongress answered by passing in 1787 the famous Northwest Ordinance\\nproviding for temporary territorial government to be followed by the\\ncreation of a popular assembly as soon as there were five thousand free\\nmales in any district. Eventual admission to the union on an equal\\nfooting with the original states was promised to the new territories.\\nReligious freedom was guaranteed. The safeguards of trial by jury,\\nregular judicial procedure, and _habeas corpus_ were established, in order\\nthat the methods of civilized life might take the place of the\\nrough-and-ready justice of lynch law. During the course of the debate on\\nthe Ordinance, Congress added the sixth article forbidding slavery and\\ninvoluntary servitude.\\n\\nThis Charter of the Northwest, so well planned by the Congress under the\\nArticles of Confederation, was continued in force by the first Congress\\nunder the Constitution in 1789. The following year its essential\\nprovisions, except the ban on slavery, were applied to the territory\\nsouth of the Ohio, ceded by North Carolina to the national government,\\nand in 1798 to the Mississippi territory, once held by Georgia. Thus it\\nwas settled for all time that \"the new colonies were not to be exploited\\nfor the benefit of the parent states (any more than for the benefit of\\nEngland) but were to be autonomous and coordinate commonwealths.\" This\\noutcome, bitterly opposed by some Eastern leaders who feared the triumph\\nof Western states over the seaboard, completed the legal steps necessary\\nby way of preparation for the flood of settlers.\\n\\n=The Land Companies, Speculators, and Western Land Tenure.=--As in the\\noriginal settlement of America, so in the opening of the West, great\\ncompanies and single proprietors of large grants early figured. In 1787\\nthe Ohio Land Company, a New England concern, acquired a million and a\\nhalf acres on the Ohio and began operations by planting the town of\\nMarietta. A professional land speculator, J.C. Symmes, secured a million\\nacres lower down where the city of Cincinnati was founded. Other\\nindividuals bought up soldiers\\' claims and so acquired enormous holdings\\nfor speculative purposes. Indeed, there was such a rush to make fortunes\\nquickly through the rise in land values that Washington was moved to cry\\nout against the \"rage for speculating in and forestalling of land on the\\nNorth West of the Ohio,\" protesting that \"scarce a valuable spot within\\nany tolerable distance of it is left without a claimant.\" He therefore\\nurged Congress to fix a reasonable price for the land, not \"too\\nexorbitant and burdensome for real occupiers, but high enough to\\ndiscourage monopolizers.\"\\n\\nCongress, however, was not prepared to use the public domain for the\\nsole purpose of developing a body of small freeholders in the West. It\\nstill looked upon the sale of public lands as an important source of\\nrevenue with which to pay off the public debt; consequently it thought\\nmore of instant income than of ultimate results. It placed no limit on\\nthe amount which could be bought when it fixed the price at $2 an acre\\nin 1796, and it encouraged the professional land operator by making the\\nfirst installment only twenty cents an acre in addition to the small\\nregistration and survey fee. On such terms a speculator with a few\\nthousand dollars could get possession of an enormous plot of land. If he\\nwas fortunate in disposing of it, he could meet the installments, which\\nwere spread over a period of four years, and make a handsome profit for\\nhimself. Even when the credit or installment feature was abolished in\\n1821 and the price of the land lowered to a cash price of $1.75 an acre,\\nthe opportunity for large speculative purchases continued to attract\\ncapital to land ventures.\\n\\n=The Development of the Small Freehold.=--The cheapness of land and the\\nscarcity of labor, nevertheless, made impossible the triumph of the huge\\nestate with its semi-servile tenantry. For about $45 a man could get a\\nfarm of 160 acres on the installment plan; another payment of $80 was\\ndue in forty days; but a four-year term was allowed for the discharge of\\nthe balance. With a capital of from two to three hundred dollars a\\nfamily could embark on a land venture. If it had good crops, it could\\nmeet the deferred payments. It was, however, a hard battle at best. Many\\na man forfeited his land through failure to pay the final installment;\\nyet in the end, in spite of all the handicaps, the small freehold of a\\nfew hundred acres at most became the typical unit of Western\\nagriculture, except in the planting states of the Gulf. Even the lands\\nof the great companies were generally broken up and sold in small lots.\\n\\nThe tendency toward moderate holdings, so favored by Western conditions,\\nwas also promoted by a clause in the Northwest Ordinance declaring that\\nthe land of any person dying intestate--that is, without any will\\ndisposing of it--should be divided equally among his descendants.\\nHildreth says of this provision: \"It established the important\\nrepublican principle, not then introduced into all the states, of the\\nequal distribution of landed as well as personal property.\" All these\\nforces combined made the wide dispersion of wealth, in the early days of\\nthe nineteenth century, an American characteristic, in marked contrast\\nwith the European system of family prestige and vast estates based on\\nthe law of primogeniture.\\n\\n\\nTHE WESTERN MIGRATION AND NEW STATES\\n\\n=The People.=--With government established, federal arms victorious over\\nthe Indians, and the lands surveyed for sale, the way was prepared for\\nthe immigrants. They came with a rush. Young New Englanders, weary of\\ntilling the stony soil of their native states, poured through New York\\nand Pennsylvania, some settling on the northern bank of the Ohio but\\nmost of them in the Lake region. Sons and daughters of German farmers in\\nPennsylvania and many a redemptioner who had discharged his bond of\\nservitude pressed out into Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, or beyond. From\\nthe exhausted fields and the clay hills of the Southern states came\\npioneers of English and Scotch-Irish descent, the latter in great\\nnumbers. Indeed one historian of high authority has ventured to say that\\n\"the rapid expansion of the United States from a coast strip to a\\ncontinental area is largely a Scotch-Irish achievement.\" While native\\nAmericans of mixed stocks led the way into the West, it was not long\\nbefore immigrants direct from Europe, under the stimulus of company\\nenterprise, began to filter into the new settlements in increasing\\nnumbers.\\n\\nThe types of people were as various as the nations they represented.\\nTimothy Flint, who published his entertaining _Recollections_ in 1826,\\nfound the West a strange mixture of all sorts and conditions of people.\\nSome of them, he relates, had been hunters in the upper world of the\\nMississippi, above the falls of St. Anthony. Some had been still farther\\nnorth, in Canada. Still others had wandered from the South--the Gulf of\\nMexico, the Red River, and the Spanish country. French boatmen and\\ntrappers, Spanish traders from the Southwest, Virginia planters with\\ntheir droves of slaves mingled with English, German, and Scotch-Irish\\nfarmers. Hunters, forest rangers, restless bordermen, and squatters,\\nlike the foaming combers of an advancing tide, went first. Then followed\\nthe farmers, masters of the ax and plow, with their wives who shared\\nevery burden and hardship and introduced some of the features of\\ncivilized life. The hunters and rangers passed on to new scenes; the\\nhome makers built for all time.\\n\\n=The Number of Immigrants.=--There were no official stations on the\\nfrontier to record the number of immigrants who entered the West during\\nthe decades following the American Revolution. But travelers of the time\\nrecord that every road was \"crowded\" with pioneers and their families,\\ntheir wagons and cattle; and that they were seldom out of the sound of\\nthe snapping whip of the teamster urging forward his horses or the crack\\nof the hunter\\'s rifle as he brought down his evening meal. \"During the\\nlatter half of 1787,\" says Coman, \"more than nine hundred boats floated\\ndown the Ohio carrying eighteen thousand men, women, and children, and\\ntwelve thousand horses, sheep, and cattle, and six hundred and fifty\\nwagons.\" Other lines of travel were also crowded and with the passing\\nyears the flooding tide of home seekers rose higher and higher.\\n\\n=The Western Routes.=--Four main routes led into the country beyond the\\nAppalachians. The Genesee road, beginning at Albany, ran almost due west\\nto the present site of Buffalo on Lake Erie, through a level country. In\\nthe dry season, wagons laden with goods could easily pass along it into\\nnorthern Ohio. A second route, through Pittsburgh, was fed by three\\neastern branches, one starting at Philadelphia, one at Baltimore, and\\nanother at Alexandria. A third main route wound through the mountains\\nfrom Alexandria to Boonesboro in Kentucky and then westward across the\\nOhio to St. Louis. A fourth, the most famous of them all, passed through\\nthe Cumberland Gap and by branches extended into the Cumberland valley\\nand the Kentucky country.\\n\\nOf these four lines of travel, the Pittsburgh route offered the most\\nadvantages. Pioneers, no matter from what section they came, when once\\nthey were on the headwaters of the Ohio and in possession of a flatboat,\\ncould find a quick and easy passage into all parts of the West and\\nSouthwest. Whether they wanted to settle in Ohio, Kentucky, or western\\nTennessee they could find their way down the drifting flood to their\\ndestination or at least to some spot near it. Many people from the South\\nas well as the Northern and Middle states chose this route; so it came\\nabout that the sons and daughters of Virginia and the Carolinas mingled\\nwith those of New York, Pennsylvania, and New England in the settlement\\nof the Northwest territory.\\n\\n=The Methods of Travel into the West.=--Many stories giving exact\\ndescriptions of methods of travel into the West in the early days have\\nbeen preserved. The country was hardly opened before visitors from the\\nOld World and from the Eastern states, impelled by curiosity, made their\\nway to the very frontier of civilization and wrote books to inform or\\namuse the public. One of them, Gilbert Imlay, an English traveler, has\\ngiven us an account of the Pittsburgh route as he found it in 1791. \"If\\na man ... \" he writes, \"has a family or goods of any sort to remove, his\\nbest way, then, would be to purchase a waggon and team of horses to\\ncarry his property to Redstone Old Fort or to Pittsburgh, according as\\nhe may come from the Northern or Southern states. A good waggon will\\ncost, at Philadelphia, about $10 ... and the horses about $12 each; they\\nwould cost something more both at Baltimore and Alexandria. The waggon\\nmay be covered with canvass, and if it is the choice of the people, they\\nmay sleep in it of nights with the greatest safety. But if they dislike\\nthat, there are inns of accommodation the whole distance on the\\ndifferent roads.... The provisions I would purchase in the same manner\\n[that is, from the farmers along the road]; and by having two or three\\ncamp kettles and stopping every evening when the weather is fine upon\\nthe brink of some rivulet and by kindling a fire they may soon dress\\ntheir own food.... This manner of journeying is so far from being\\ndisagreeable that in a fine season it is extremely pleasant.\" The\\nimmigrant once at Pittsburgh or Wheeling could then buy a flatboat of a\\nsize required for his goods and stock, and drift down the current to his\\njourney\\'s end.\\n\\n[Illustration: ROADS AND TRAILS INTO THE WESTERN TERRITORY]\\n\\n=The Admission of Kentucky and Tennessee.=--When the eighteenth century\\ndrew to a close, Kentucky had a population larger than Delaware, Rhode\\nIsland, or New Hampshire. Tennessee claimed 60,000 inhabitants. In 1792\\nKentucky took her place as a state beside her none too kindly parent,\\nVirginia. The Eastern Federalists resented her intrusion; but they took\\nsome consolation in the admission of Vermont because the balance of\\nEastern power was still retained.\\n\\nAs if to assert their independence of old homes and conservative ideas\\nthe makers of Kentucky\\'s first constitution swept aside the landed\\nqualification on the suffrage and gave the vote to all free white males.\\nFour years later, Kentucky\\'s neighbor to the south, Tennessee, followed\\nthis step toward a wider democracy. After encountering fierce opposition\\nfrom the Federalists, Tennessee was accepted as the sixteenth state.\\n\\n=Ohio.=--The door of the union had hardly opened for Tennessee when\\nanother appeal was made to Congress, this time from the pioneers in\\nOhio. The little posts founded at Marietta and Cincinnati had grown into\\nflourishing centers of trade. The stream of immigrants, flowing down the\\nriver, added daily to their numbers and the growing settlements all\\naround poured produce into their markets to be exchanged for \"store\\ngoods.\" After the Indians were disposed of in 1794 and the last British\\nsoldier left the frontier forts under the terms of the Jay treaty of\\n1795, tiny settlements of families appeared on Lake Erie in the \"Western\\nReserve,\" a region that had been retained by Connecticut when she\\nsurrendered her other rights in the Northwest.\\n\\nAt the close of the century, Ohio, claiming a population of more than\\n50,000, grew discontented with its territorial status. Indeed, two years\\nbefore the enactment of the Northwest Ordinance, squatters in that\\nregion had been invited by one John Emerson to hold a convention after\\nthe fashion of the men of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield in old\\nConnecticut and draft a frame of government for themselves. This true\\nson of New England declared that men \"have an undoubted right to pass\\ninto every vacant country and there to form their constitution and that\\nfrom the confederation of the whole United States Congress is not\\nempowered to forbid them.\" This grand convention was never held because\\nthe heavy hand of the government fell upon the leaders; but the spirit\\nof John Emerson did not perish. In November, 1802, a convention chosen\\nby voters, assembled under the authority of Congress at Chillicothe,\\ndrew up a constitution. It went into force after a popular ratification.\\nThe roll of the convention bore such names as Abbot, Baldwin, Cutler,\\nHuntington, Putnam, and Sargent, and the list of counties from which\\nthey came included Adams, Fairfield, Hamilton, Jefferson, Trumbull, and\\nWashington, showing that the new America in the West was peopled and led\\nby the old stock. In 1803 Ohio was admitted to the union.\\n\\n=Indiana and Illinois.=--As in the neighboring state, the frontier in\\nIndiana advanced northward from the Ohio, mainly under the leadership,\\nhowever, of settlers from the South--restless Kentuckians hoping for\\nbetter luck in a newer country and pioneers from the far frontiers of\\nVirginia and North Carolina. As soon as a tier of counties swinging\\nupward like the horns of the moon against Ohio on the east and in the\\nWabash Valley on the west was fairly settled, a clamor went up for\\nstatehood. Under the authority of an act of Congress in 1816 the\\nIndianians drafted a constitution and inaugurated their government at\\nCorydon. \"The majority of the members of the convention,\" we are told by\\na local historian, \"were frontier farmers who had a general idea of what\\nthey wanted and had sense enough to let their more erudite colleagues\\nput it into shape.\"\\n\\nTwo years later, the pioneers of Illinois, also settled upward from the\\nOhio, like Indiana, elected their delegates to draft a constitution.\\nLeadership in the convention, quite properly, was taken by a man born in\\nNew York and reared in Tennessee; and the constitution as finally\\ndrafted \"was in its principal provisions a copy of the then existing\\nconstitutions of Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana.... Many of the articles\\nare exact copies in wording although differently arranged and\\nnumbered.\"\\n\\n=Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.=--Across the Mississippi to the\\nfar south, clearing and planting had gone on with much bustle and\\nenterprise. The cotton and sugar lands of Louisiana, opened by French\\nand Spanish settlers, were widened in every direction by planters with\\ntheir armies of slaves from the older states. New Orleans, a good market\\nand a center of culture not despised even by the pioneer, grew apace. In\\n1810 the population of lower Louisiana was over 75,000. The time had\\ncome, said the leaders of the people, to fulfill the promise made to\\nFrance in the treaty of cession; namely, to grant to the inhabitants of\\nthe territory statehood and the rights of American citizens. Federalists\\nfrom New England still having a voice in Congress, if somewhat weaker,\\nstill protested in tones of horror. \"I am compelled to declare it as my\\ndeliberate opinion,\" pronounced Josiah Quincy in the House of\\nRepresentatives, \"that if this bill [to admit Louisiana] passes, the\\nbonds of this Union are virtually dissolved ... that as it will be the\\nright of all, so it will be the duty of some [states] to prepare\\ndefinitely for a separation; amicably if they can, violently if they\\nmust.... It is a death blow to the Constitution. It may afterwards\\nlinger; but lingering, its fate will, at no very distant period, be\\nconsummated.\" Federalists from New York like those from New England had\\ntheir doubts about the wisdom of admitting Western states; but the party\\nof Jefferson and Madison, having the necessary majority, granted the\\ncoveted statehood to Louisiana in 1812.\\n\\nWhen, a few years later, Mississippi and Alabama knocked at the doors of\\nthe union, the Federalists had so little influence, on account of their\\nconduct during the second war with England, that spokesmen from the\\nSouthwest met a kindlier reception at Washington. Mississippi, in 1817,\\nand Alabama, in 1819, took their places among the United States of\\nAmerica. Both of them, while granting white manhood suffrage, gave their\\nconstitutions the tone of the old East by providing landed\\nqualifications for the governor and members of the legislature.\\n\\n=Missouri.=--Far to the north in the Louisiana purchase, a new\\ncommonwealth was rising to power. It was peopled by immigrants who came\\ndown the Ohio in fleets of boats or crossed the Mississippi from\\nKentucky and Tennessee. Thrifty Germans from Pennsylvania, hardy farmers\\nfrom Virginia ready to work with their own hands, freemen seeking\\nfreemen\\'s homes, planters with their slaves moving on from worn-out\\nfields on the seaboard, came together in the widening settlements of the\\nMissouri country. Peoples from the North and South flowed together,\\nsmall farmers and big planters mingling in one community. When their\\nnumbers had reached sixty thousand or more, they precipitated a contest\\nover their admission to the union, \"ringing an alarm bell in the night,\"\\nas Jefferson phrased it. The favorite expedient of compromise with\\nslavery was brought forth in Congress once more. Maine consequently was\\nbrought into the union without slavery and Missouri with slavery. At the\\nsame time there was drawn westward through the rest of the Louisiana\\nterritory a line separating servitude from slavery.\\n\\n\\nTHE SPIRIT OF THE FRONTIER\\n\\n=Land Tenure and Liberty.=--Over an immense western area there developed\\nan unbroken system of freehold farms. In the Gulf states and the lower\\nMississippi Valley, it is true, the planter with his many slaves even\\nled in the pioneer movement; but through large sections of Tennessee and\\nKentucky, as well as upper Georgia and Alabama, and all throughout the\\nNorthwest territory the small farmer reigned supreme. In this immense\\ndominion there sprang up a civilization without caste or class--a body\\nof people all having about the same amount of this world\\'s goods and\\nderiving their livelihood from one source: the labor of their own hands\\non the soil. The Northwest territory alone almost equaled in area all\\nthe original thirteen states combined, except Georgia, and its system of\\nagricultural economy was unbroken by plantations and feudal estates. \"In\\nthe subdivision of the soil and the great equality of condition,\" as\\nWebster said on more than one occasion, \"lay the true basis, most\\ncertainly, of popular government.\" There was the undoubted source of\\nJacksonian democracy.\\n\\n[Illustration: A LOG CABIN--LINCOLN\\'S BIRTHPLACE]\\n\\n=The Characteristics of the Western People.=--Travelers into the\\nNorthwest during the early years of the nineteenth century were agreed\\nthat the people of that region were almost uniformly marked by the\\ncharacteristics common to an independent yeomanry. A close observer thus\\nrecorded his impressions: \"A spirit of adventurous enterprise, a\\nwillingness to go through any hardship to accomplish an object....\\nIndependence of thought and action. They have felt the influence of\\nthese principles from their childhood. Men who can endure anything; that\\nhave lived almost without restraint, free as the mountain air or as the\\ndeer and the buffalo of their forests, and who know they are Americans\\nall.... An apparent roughness which some would deem rudeness of\\nmanner.... Where there is perfect equality in a neighborhood of people\\nwho know little about each other\\'s previous history or ancestry but\\nwhere each is lord of the soil he cultivates. Where a log cabin is all\\nthat the best of families can expect to have for years and of course can\\npossess few of the external decorations which have so much influence in\\ncreating a diversity of rank in society. These circumstances have laid\\nthe foundation for that equality of intercourse, simplicity of manners,\\nwant of deference, want of reserve, great readiness to make\\nacquaintances, freedom of speech, indisposition to brook real or\\nimaginary insults which one witnesses among people of the West.\"\\n\\nThis equality, this independence, this rudeness so often described by\\nthe traveler as marking a new country, were all accentuated by the\\ncharacter of the settlers themselves. Traces of the fierce, unsociable,\\neagle-eyed, hard-drinking hunter remained. The settlers who followed the\\nhunter were, with some exceptions, soldiers of the Revolutionary army,\\nfarmers of the \"middling order,\" and mechanics from the towns,--English,\\nScotch-Irish, Germans,--poor in possessions and thrown upon the labor of\\ntheir own hands for support. Sons and daughters from well-to-do Eastern\\nhomes sometimes brought softer manners; but the equality of life and the\\nleveling force of labor in forest and field soon made them one in spirit\\nwith their struggling neighbors. Even the preachers and teachers, who\\ncame when the cabins were raised in the clearings and rude churches and\\nschoolhouses were built, preached sermons and taught lessons that\\nsavored of the frontier, as any one may know who reads Peter\\nCartwright\\'s _A Muscular Christian_ or Eggleston\\'s _The Hoosier\\nSchoolmaster_.\\n\\n\\nTHE WEST AND THE EAST MEET\\n\\n=The East Alarmed.=--A people so independent as the Westerners and so\\nattached to local self-government gave the conservative East many a rude\\nshock, setting gentlemen in powdered wigs and knee breeches agog with\\nthe idea that terrible things might happen in the Mississippi Valley.\\nNot without good grounds did Washington fear that \"a touch of a feather\\nwould turn\" the Western settlers away from the seaboard to the\\nSpaniards; and seriously did he urge the East not to neglect them, lest\\nthey be \"drawn into the arms of, or be dependent upon foreigners.\"\\nTaking advantage of the restless spirit in the Southwest, Aaron Burr,\\nhaving disgraced himself by killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel, laid\\nwild plans, if not to bring about a secession in that region, at least\\nto build a state of some kind out of the Spanish dominions adjoining\\nLouisiana. Frightened at such enterprises and fearing the dominance of\\nthe West, the Federalists, with a few conspicuous exceptions, opposed\\nequality between the sections. Had their narrow views prevailed, the\\nWest, with its new democracy, would have been held in perpetual tutelage\\nto the seaboard or perhaps been driven into independence as the thirteen\\ncolonies had been not long before.\\n\\n=Eastern Friends of the West.=--Fortunately for the nation, there were\\nmany Eastern leaders, particularly from the South, who understood the\\nWest, approved its spirit, and sought to bring the two sections together\\nby common bonds. Washington kept alive and keen the zeal for Western\\nadvancement which he acquired in his youth as a surveyor. He never grew\\ntired of urging upon his Eastern friends the importance of the lands\\nbeyond the mountains. He pressed upon the governor of Virginia a project\\nfor a wagon road connecting the seaboard with the Ohio country and was\\nactive in a movement to improve the navigation of the Potomac. He\\nadvocated strengthening the ties of commerce. \"Smooth the roads,\" he\\nsaid, \"and make easy the way for them, and then see what an influx of\\narticles will be poured upon us; how amazingly our exports will be\\nincreased by them; and how amply we shall be compensated for any trouble\\nand expense we may encounter to effect it.\" Jefferson, too, was\\ninterested in every phase of Western development--the survey of lands,\\nthe exploration of waterways, the opening of trade, and even the\\ndiscovery of the bones of prehistoric animals. Robert Fulton, the\\ninventor of the steamboat, was another man of vision who for many years\\npressed upon his countrymen the necessity of uniting East and West by a\\ncanal which would cement the union, raise the value of the public lands,\\nand extend the principles of confederate and republican government.\\n\\n=The Difficulties of Early Transportation.=--Means of communication\\nplayed an important part in the strategy of all those who sought to\\nbring together the seaboard and the frontier. The produce of the\\nWest--wheat, corn, bacon, hemp, cattle, and tobacco--was bulky and the\\ncost of overland transportation was prohibitive. In the Eastern market,\\n\"a cow and her calf were given for a bushel of salt, while a suit of\\n\\'store clothes\\' cost as much as a farm.\" In such circumstances, the\\ninhabitants of the Mississippi Valley were forced to ship their produce\\nover a long route by way of New Orleans and to pay high freight rates\\nfor everything that was brought across the mountains. Scows of from five\\nto fifty tons were built at the towns along the rivers and piloted down\\nthe stream to the Crescent City. In a few cases small ocean-going\\nvessels were built to transport goods to the West Indies or to the\\nEastern coast towns. Salt, iron, guns, powder, and the absolute\\nessentials which the pioneers had to buy mainly in Eastern markets were\\ncarried over narrow wagon trails that were almost impassable in the\\nrainy season.\\n\\n=The National Road.=--To far-sighted men, like Albert Gallatin, \"the\\nfather of internal improvements,\" the solution of this problem was the\\nconstruction of roads and canals. Early in Jefferson\\'s administration,\\nCongress dedicated a part of the proceeds from the sale of lands to\\nbuilding highways from the headwaters of the navigable waters emptying\\ninto the Atlantic to the Ohio River and beyond into the Northwest\\nterritory. In 1806, after many misgivings, it authorized a great\\nnational highway binding the East and the West. The Cumberland Road, as\\nit was called, began in northwestern Maryland, wound through southern\\nPennsylvania, crossed the narrow neck of Virginia at Wheeling, and then\\nshot almost straight across Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, into Missouri.\\nBy 1817, stagecoaches were running between Washington and Wheeling; by\\n1833 contractors had carried their work to Columbus, Ohio, and by 1852,\\nto Vandalia, Illinois. Over this ballasted road mail and passenger\\ncoaches could go at high speed, and heavy freight wagons proceed in\\nsafety at a steady pace.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE CUMBERLAND ROAD]\\n\\n=Canals and Steamboats.=--A second epoch in the economic union of the\\nEast and West was reached with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825,\\noffering an all-water route from New York City to the Great Lakes and\\nthe Mississippi Valley. Pennsylvania, alarmed by the advantages\\nconferred on New York by this enterprise, began her system of canals and\\nportages from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, completing the last link in\\n1834. In the South, the Chesapeake and Ohio Company, chartered in 1825,\\nwas busy with a project to connect Georgetown and Cumberland when\\nrailways broke in upon the undertaking before it was half finished.\\nAbout the same time, Ohio built a canal across the state, affording\\nwater communication between Lake Erie and the Ohio River through a rich\\nwheat belt. Passengers could now travel by canal boat into the West with\\ncomparative ease and comfort, if not at a rapid speed, and the bulkiest\\nof freight could be easily handled. Moreover, the rate charged for\\ncarrying goods was cut by the Erie Canal from $32 a ton per hundred\\nmiles to $1. New Orleans was destined to lose her primacy in the\\nMississippi Valley.\\n\\nThe diversion of traffic to Eastern markets was also stimulated by\\nsteamboats which appeared on the Ohio about 1810, three years after\\nFulton had made his famous trip on the Hudson. It took twenty men to\\nsail and row a five-ton scow up the river at a speed of from ten to\\ntwenty miles a day. In 1825, Timothy Flint traveled a hundred miles a\\nday on the new steamer _Grecian_ \"against the whole weight of the\\nMississippi current.\" Three years later the round trip from Louisville\\nto New Orleans was cut to eight days. Heavy produce that once had to\\nfloat down to New Orleans could be carried upstream and sent to the East\\nby way of the canal systems.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n\\nAN EARLY MISSISSIPPI STEAMBOAT]\\n\\nThus the far country was brought near. The timid no longer hesitated at\\nthe thought of the perilous journey. All routes were crowded with\\nWestern immigrants. The forests fell before the ax like grain before the\\nsickle. Clearings scattered through the woods spread out into a great\\nmosaic of farms stretching from the Southern Appalachians to Lake\\nMichigan. The national census of 1830 gave 937,000 inhabitants to Ohio;\\n343,000 to Indiana; 157,000 to Illinois; 687,000 to Kentucky; and\\n681,000 to Tennessee.\\n\\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, 1830]\\n\\nWith the increase in population and the growth of agriculture came\\npolitical influence. People who had once petitioned Congress now sent\\ntheir own representatives. Men who had hitherto accepted without\\nprotests Presidents from the seaboard expressed a new spirit of dissent\\nin 1824 by giving only three electoral votes for John Quincy Adams; and\\nfour years later they sent a son of the soil from Tennessee, Andrew\\nJackson, to take Washington\\'s chair as chief executive of the\\nnation--the first of a long line of Presidents from the Mississippi\\nbasin.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nW.G.

By the admission of these [new] states that balance has been\\nmaterially affected and unless the practice be modified must ultimately\\nbe destroyed. The Southern states will first avail themselves of their\\nnew confederates to govern the East, and finally the Western states,\\nmultiplied in number, and augmented in population, will control the\\ninterests of the whole.\" Strangely enough the fulfillment of this\\nprophecy was being prepared even in Federalist strongholds by the rise\\nof a new urban democracy that was to make common cause with the farmers\\nbeyond the mountains.\\n\\n\\nTHE DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT IN THE EAST\\n\\n=The Aristocratic Features of the Old Order.=--The Revolutionary\\nfathers, in setting up their first state constitutions, although they\\noften spoke of government as founded on the consent of the governed, did\\nnot think that consistency required giving the vote to all adult males.\\nOn the contrary they looked upon property owners as the only safe\\n\"depositary\" of political power. They went back to the colonial\\ntradition that related taxation and representation. This, they argued,\\nwas not only just but a safeguard against the \"excesses of democracy.\"\\n\\nIn carrying their theory into execution they placed taxpaying or\\nproperty qualifications on the right to vote. Broadly speaking, these\\nlimitations fell into three classes. Three states, Pennsylvania (1776),\\nNew Hampshire (1784), and Georgia (1798), gave the ballot to all who\\npaid taxes, without reference to the value of their property. Three,\\nVirginia, Delaware, and Rhode Island, clung firmly to the ancient\\nprinciples that only freeholders could be intrusted with electoral\\nrights. Still other states, while closely restricting the suffrage,\\naccepted the ownership of other things as well as land in fulfillment of\\nthe requirements. In Massachusetts, for instance, the vote was granted\\nto all men who held land yielding an annual income of three pounds or\\npossessed other property worth sixty pounds.\\n\\nThe electors thus enfranchised, numerous as they were, owing to the wide\\ndistribution of land, often suffered from a very onerous disability. In\\nmany states they were able to vote only for persons of wealth because\\nheavy property qualifications were imposed on public officers. In New\\nHampshire, the governor had to be worth five hundred pounds, one-half in\\nland; in Massachusetts, one thousand pounds, all freehold; in Maryland,\\nfive thousand pounds, one thousand of which was freehold; in North\\nCarolina, one thousand pounds freehold; and in South Carolina, ten\\nthousand pounds freehold. A state senator in Massachusetts had to be the\\nowner of a freehold worth three hundred pounds or personal property\\nworth six hundred pounds; in New Jersey, one thousand pounds\\' worth of\\nproperty; in North Carolina, three hundred acres of land; in South\\nCarolina, two thousand pounds freehold. For members of the lower house\\nof the legislature lower qualifications were required.\\n\\nIn most of the states the suffrage or office holding or both were\\nfurther restricted by religious provisions. No single sect was powerful\\nenough to dominate after the Revolution, but, for the most part,\\nCatholics and Jews were either disfranchised or excluded from office.\\nNorth Carolina and Georgia denied the ballot to any one who was not a\\nProtestant. Delaware withheld it from all who did not believe in the\\nTrinity and the inspiration of the Scriptures. Massachusetts and\\nMaryland limited it to Christians. Virginia and New York, advanced for\\ntheir day, made no discrimination in government on account of religious\\nopinion.\\n\\n=The Defense of the Old Order.=--It must not be supposed that property\\nqualifications were thoughtlessly imposed at the outset or considered of\\nlittle consequence in practice. In the beginning they were viewed as\\nfundamental. As towns grew in size and the number of landless citizens\\nincreased, the restrictions were defended with even more vigor. In\\nMassachusetts, the great Webster upheld the rights of property in\\ngovernment, saying: \"It is entirely just that property should have its\\ndue weight and consideration in political arrangements.... The\\ndisastrous revolutions which the world has witnessed, those political\\nthunderstorms and earthquakes which have shaken the pillars of society\\nto their deepest foundations, have been revolutions against property.\"\\nIn Pennsylvania, a leader in local affairs cried out against a plan to\\nremove the taxpaying limitation on the suffrage: \"What does the delegate\\npropose? To place the vicious vagrant, the wandering Arabs, the Tartar\\nhordes of our large cities on the level with the virtuous and good man?\"\\nIn Virginia, Jefferson himself had first believed in property\\nqualifications and had feared with genuine alarm the \"mobs of the great\\ncities.\" It was near the end of the eighteenth century before he\\naccepted the idea of manhood suffrage. Even then he was unable to\\nconvince the constitution-makers of his own state. \"It is not an idle\\nchimera of the brain,\" urged one of them, \"that the possession of land\\nfurnishes the strongest evidence of permanent, common interest with, and\\nattachment to, the community.... It is upon this foundation I wish to\\nplace the right of suffrage. This is the best general standard which can\\nbe resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the persons to be\\ninvested with the right of suffrage are such persons as could be,\\nconsistently with the safety and well-being of the community, intrusted\\nwith the exercise of that right.\"\\n\\n=Attacks on the Restricted Suffrage.=--The changing circumstances of\\nAmerican life, however, soon challenged the rule of those with property.\\nProminent among the new forces were the rising mercantile and business\\ninterests. Where the freehold qualification was applied, business men\\nwho did not own land were deprived of the vote and excluded from office.\\nIn New York, for example, the most illiterate farmer who had one hundred\\npounds\\' worth of land could vote for state senator and governor, while\\nthe landless banker or merchant could not. It is not surprising,\\ntherefore, to find business men taking the lead in breaking down\\nfreehold limitations on the suffrage. The professional classes also were\\ninterested in removing the barriers which excluded many of them from\\npublic affairs. It was a schoolmaster, Thomas Dorr, who led the popular\\nuprising in Rhode Island which brought the exclusive rule by freeholders\\nto an end.\\n\\nIn addition to the business and professional classes, the mechanics of\\nthe towns showed a growing hostility to a system of government that\\ngenerally barred them from voting or holding office. Though not\\nnumerous, they had early begun to exercise an influence on the course of\\npublic affairs. They had led the riots against the Stamp Act, overturned\\nKing George\\'s statue, and \"crammed stamps down the throats of\\ncollectors.\" When the state constitutions were framed they took a lively\\ninterest, particularly in New York City and Philadelphia. In June, 1776,\\nthe \"mechanicks in union\" in New York protested against putting the new\\nstate constitution into effect without their approval, declaring that\\nthe right to vote on the acceptance or rejection of a fundamental law\\n\"is the birthright of every man to whatever state he may belong.\" Though\\ntheir petition was rejected, their spirit remained. When, a few years\\nlater, the federal Constitution was being framed, the mechanics watched\\nthe process with deep concern; they knew that one of its main objects\\nwas to promote trade and commerce, affecting directly their daily bread.\\nDuring the struggle over ratification, they passed resolutions approving\\nits provisions and they often joined in parades organized to stir up\\nsentiment for the Constitution, even though they could not vote for\\nmembers of the state conventions and so express their will directly.\\nAfter the organization of trade unions they collided with the courts of\\nlaw and thus became interested in the election of judges and lawmakers.\\n\\nThose who attacked the old system of class rule found a strong moral\\nsupport in the Declaration of Independence. Was it not said that all men\\nare created equal? Whoever runs may read. Was it not declared that\\ngovernments derive their just power from the consent of the governed?\\nThat doctrine was applied with effect to George III and seemed\\nappropriate for use against the privileged classes of Massachusetts or\\nVirginia. \"How do the principles thus proclaimed,\" asked the\\nnon-freeholders of Richmond, in petitioning for the ballot, \"accord with\\nthe existing regulation of the suffrage? A regulation which, instead of\\nthe equality nature ordains, creates an odious distinction between\\nmembers of the same community ... and vests in a favored class, not in\\nconsideration of their public services but of their private possessions,\\nthe highest of all privileges.\"\\n\\n=Abolition of Property Qualifications.=--By many minor victories rather\\nthan by any spectacular triumphs did the advocates of manhood suffrage\\ncarry the day. Slight gains were made even during the Revolution or\\nshortly afterward. In Pennsylvania, the mechanics, by taking an active\\npart in the contest over the Constitution of 1776, were able to force\\nthe qualification down to the payment of a small tax. Vermont came into\\nthe union in 1792 without any property restrictions. In the same year\\nDelaware gave the vote to all men who paid taxes. Maryland, reckoned one\\nof the most conservative of states, embarked on the experiment of\\nmanhood suffrage in 1809; and nine years later, Connecticut, equally\\nconservative, decided that all taxpayers were worthy of the ballot.\\n\\nFive states, Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, Rhode Island, and North\\nCarolina, remained obdurate while these changes were going on around\\nthem; finally they had to yield themselves. The last struggle in\\nMassachusetts took place in the constitutional convention of 1820. There\\nWebster, in the prime of his manhood, and John Adams, in the closing\\nyears of his old age, alike protested against such radical innovations\\nas manhood suffrage. Their protests were futile. The property test was\\nabolished and a small tax-paying qualification was substituted. New York\\nsurrendered the next year and, after trying some minor restrictions for\\nfive years, went completely over to white manhood suffrage in 1826.\\nRhode Island clung to her freehold qualification through thirty years of\\nagitation. Then Dorr\\'s Rebellion, almost culminating in bloodshed,\\nbrought about a reform in 1843 which introduced a slight tax-paying\\nqualification as an alternative to the freehold. Virginia and North\\nCarolina were still unconvinced. The former refused to abandon ownership\\nof land as the test for political rights until 1850 and the latter until\\n1856. Although religious discriminations and property qualifications for\\noffice holders were sometimes retained after the establishment of\\nmanhood suffrage, they were usually abolished along with the monopoly of\\ngovernment enjoyed by property owners and taxpayers.\\n\\n[Illustration: THOMAS DORR AROUSING HIS FOLLOWERS]\\n\\nAt the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century, the white\\nmale industrial workers and the mechanics of the Northern cities, at\\nleast, could lay aside the petition for the ballot and enjoy with the\\nfree farmer a voice in the government of their common country.\\n\"Universal democracy,\" sighed Carlyle, who was widely read in the United\\nStates, \"whatever we may think of it has declared itself the inevitable\\nfact of the days in which we live; and he who has any chance to instruct\\nor lead in these days must begin by admitting that ... Where no\\ngovernment is wanted, save that of the parish constable, as in America\\nwith its boundless soil, every man being able to find work and\\nrecompense for himself, democracy may subsist; not elsewhere.\" Amid the\\ngrave misgivings of the first generation of statesmen, America was\\ncommitted to the great adventure, in the populous towns of the East as\\nwell as in the forests and fields of the West.\\n\\n\\nTHE NEW DEMOCRACY ENTERS THE ARENA\\n\\nThe spirit of the new order soon had a pronounced effect on the\\nmachinery of government and the practice of politics. The enfranchised\\nelectors were not long in demanding for themselves a larger share in\\nadministration.\\n\\n=The Spoils System and Rotation in Office.=--First of all they wanted\\noffice for themselves, regardless of their fitness. They therefore\\nextended the system of rewarding party workers with government\\npositions--a system early established in several states, notably New\\nYork and Pennsylvania. Closely connected with it was the practice of\\nfixing short terms for officers and making frequent changes in\\npersonnel. \"Long continuance in office,\" explained a champion of this\\nidea in Pennsylvania in 1837, \"unfits a man for the discharge of its\\nduties, by rendering him arbitrary and aristocratic, and tends to beget,\\nfirst life office, and then hereditary office, which leads to the\\ndestruction of free government.\" The solution offered was the historic\\ndoctrine of \"rotation in office.\" At the same time the principle of\\npopular election was extended to an increasing number of officials who\\nhad once been appointed either by the governor or the legislature. Even\\ngeologists, veterinarians, surveyors, and other technical officers were\\ndeclared elective on the theory that their appointment \"smacked of\\nmonarchy.\"\\n\\n=Popular Election of Presidential Electors.=--In a short time the spirit\\nof democracy, while playing havoc with the old order in state\\ngovernment, made its way upward into the federal system. The framers of\\nthe Constitution, bewildered by many proposals and unable to agree on\\nany single plan, had committed the choice of presidential electors to\\nthe discretion of the state legislatures. The legislatures, in turn,\\ngreedy of power, early adopted the practice of choosing the electors\\nthemselves; but they did not enjoy it long undisturbed. Democracy,\\nthundering at their doors, demanded that they surrender the privilege to\\nthe people. Reluctantly they yielded, sometimes granting popular\\nelection and then withdrawing it. The drift was inevitable, and the\\nclimax came with the advent of Jacksonian democracy. In 1824, Vermont,\\nNew York, Delaware, South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana, though some\\nhad experimented with popular election, still left the choice of\\nelectors with the legislature. Eight years later South Carolina alone\\nheld to the old practice. Popular election had become the final word.\\nThe fanciful idea of an electoral college of \"good and wise men,\"\\nselected without passion or partisanship by state legislatures acting as\\ndeliberative bodies, was exploded for all time; the election of the\\nnation\\'s chief magistrate was committed to the tempestuous methods of\\ndemocracy.\\n\\n=The Nominating Convention.=--As the suffrage was widened and the\\npopular choice of presidential electors extended, there arose a violent\\nprotest against the methods used by the political parties in nominating\\ncandidates. After the retirement of Washington, both the Republicans and\\nthe Federalists found it necessary to agree upon their favorites before\\nthe election, and they adopted a colonial device--the pre-election\\ncaucus. The Federalist members of Congress held a conference and\\nselected their candidate, and the Republicans followed the example. In\\na short time the practice of nominating by a \"congressional caucus\"\\nbecame a recognized institution. The election still remained with the\\npeople; but the power of picking candidates for their approval passed\\ninto the hands of a small body of Senators and Representatives.\\n\\n\\nA reaction against this was unavoidable. To friends of \"the plain\\npeople,\" like Andrew Jackson, it was intolerable, all the more so\\nbecause the caucus never favored him with the nomination. More\\nconservative men also found grave objections to it. They pointed out\\nthat, whereas the Constitution intended the President to be an\\nindependent officer, he had now fallen under the control of a caucus of\\ncongressmen. The supremacy of the legislative branch had been obtained\\nby an extra-legal political device. To such objections were added\\npractical considerations. In 1824, when personal rivalry had taken the\\nplace of party conflicts, the congressional caucus selected as the\\ncandidate, William H. Crawford, of Georgia, a man of distinction but no\\ngreat popularity, passing by such an obvious hero as General Jackson.\\nThe followers of the General were enraged and demanded nothing short of\\nthe death of \"King Caucus.\" Their clamor was effective. Under their\\nattacks, the caucus came to an ignominious end.\\n\\nIn place of it there arose in 1831 a new device, the national nominating\\nconvention, composed of delegates elected by party voters for the sole\\npurpose of nominating candidates. Senators and Representatives were\\nstill prominent in the party councils, but they were swamped by hundreds\\nof delegates \"fresh from the people,\" as Jackson was wont to say. In\\nfact, each convention was made up mainly of office holders and office\\nseekers, and the new institution was soon denounced as vigorously as\\nKing Caucus had been, particularly by statesmen who failed to obtain a\\nnomination. Still it grew in strength and by 1840 was firmly\\nestablished.\\n\\n=The End of the Old Generation.=--In the election of 1824, the\\nrepresentatives of the \"aristocracy\" made their last successful stand.\\nUntil then the leadership by men of \"wealth and talents\" had been\\nundisputed. There had been five Presidents--Washington, John Adams,\\nJefferson, Madison, and Monroe--all Eastern men brought up in prosperous\\nfamilies with the advantages of culture which come from leisure and the\\npossession of life\\'s refinements. None of them had ever been compelled\\nto work with his hands for a livelihood. Four of them had been\\nslaveholders. Jefferson was a philosopher, learned in natural science, a\\nmaster of foreign languages, a gentleman of dignity and grace of manner,\\nnotwithstanding his studied simplicity. Madison, it was said, was armed\\n\"with all the culture of his century.\" Monroe was a graduate of William\\nand Mary, a gentleman of the old school. Jefferson and his three\\nsuccessors called themselves Republicans and professed a genuine faith\\nin the people but they were not \"of the people\" themselves; they were\\nnot sons of the soil or the workshop. They were all men of \"the grand\\n\\nold order of society\" who gave finish and style even to popular\\ngovernment.\\n\\nMonroe was the last of the Presidents belonging to the heroic epoch of\\nthe Revolution. He had served in the war for independence, in the\\nCongress under the Articles of Confederation, and in official capacity\\nafter the adoption of the Constitution. In short, he was of the age that\\nhad wrought American independence and set the government afloat. With\\nhis passing, leadership went to a new generation; but his successor,\\nJohn Quincy Adams, formed a bridge between the old and the new in that\\nhe combined a high degree of culture with democratic sympathies.\\nWashington had died in 1799, preceded but a few months by Patrick Henry\\nand followed in four years by Samuel Adams. Hamilton had been killed in\\na duel with Burr in 1804. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were yet alive\\nin 1824 but they were soon to pass from the scene, reconciled at last,\\nfull of years and honors. Madison was in dignified retirement, destined\\nto live long enough to protest against the doctrine of nullification\\nproclaimed by South Carolina before death carried him away at the ripe\\nold age of eighty-five.\\n\\n=The Election of John Quincy Adams (1824).=--The campaign of 1824 marked\\nthe end of the \"era of good feeling\" inaugurated by the collapse of the\\nFederalist party after the election of 1816. There were four leading\\ncandidates, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, and W.H.\\nCrawford. The result of the election was a division of the electoral\\nvotes into four parts and no one received a majority. Under the\\nConstitution, therefore, the selection of President passed to the House\\nof Representatives. Clay, who stood at the bottom of the poll, threw his\\nweight to Adams and assured his triumph, much to the chagrin of\\nJackson\\'s friends. They thought, with a certain justification, that\\ninasmuch as the hero of New Orleans had received the largest electoral\\nvote, the House was morally bound to accept the popular judgment and\\nmake him President. Jackson shook hands cordially with Adams on the day\\nof the inauguration, but never forgave him for being elected.\\n\\nWhile Adams called himself a Republican in politics and often spoke of\\n\"the rule of the people,\" he was regarded by Jackson\\'s followers as \"an\\naristocrat.\" He was not a son of the soil. Neither was he acquainted at\\nfirst hand with the labor of farmers and mechanics. He had been educated\\nat Harvard and in Europe. Like his illustrious father, John Adams, he\\nwas a stern and reserved man, little given to seeking popularity.\\nMoreover, he was from the East and the frontiersmen of the West regarded\\nhim as a man \"born with a silver spoon in his mouth.\" Jackson\\'s\\nsupporters especially disliked him because they thought their hero\\nentitled to the presidency. Their anger was deepened when Adams\\nappointed Clay to the office of Secretary of State; and they set up a\\ncry that there had been a \"deal\" by which Clay had helped to elect Adams\\nto get office for himself.\\n\\nThough Adams conducted his administration with great dignity and in a\\nfine spirit of public service, he was unable to overcome the opposition\\nwhich he encountered on his election to office or to win popularity in\\nthe West and South. On the contrary, by advocating government assistance\\nin building roads and canals and public grants in aid of education,\\narts, and sciences, he ran counter to the current which had set in\\nagainst appropriations of federal funds for internal improvements. By\\nsigning the Tariff Bill of 1828, soon known as the \"Tariff of\\nAbominations,\" he made new enemies without adding to his friends in New\\nYork, Pennsylvania, and Ohio where he sorely needed them. Handicapped by\\nthe false charge that he had been a party to a \"corrupt bargain\" with\\nClay to secure his first election; attacked for his advocacy of a high\\nprotective tariff; charged with favoring an \"aristocracy of\\noffice-holders\" in Washington on account of his refusal to discharge\\ngovernment clerks by the wholesale, Adams was retired from the White\\nHouse after he had served four years.\\n\\n=The Triumph of Jackson in 1828.=--Probably no candidate for the\\npresidency ever had such passionate popular support as Andrew Jackson\\nhad in 1828. He was truly a man of the people. Born of poor parents in\\nthe upland region of South Carolina, schooled in poverty and adversity,\\nwithout the advantages of education or the refinements of cultivated\\nleisure, he seemed the embodiment of the spirit of the new American\\ndemocracy. Early in his youth he had gone into the frontier of Tennessee\\nwhere he soon won a name as a fearless and intrepid Indian fighter. On\\nthe march and in camp, he endeared himself to his men by sharing their\\nhardships, sleeping on the ground with them, and eating parched corn\\nwhen nothing better could be found for the privates. From local\\nprominence he sprang into national fame by his exploit at the battle of\\nNew Orleans. His reputation as a military hero was enhanced by the\\nfeeling that he had been a martyr to political treachery in 1824. The\\nfarmers of the West and South claimed him as their own. The mechanics of\\nthe Eastern cities, newly enfranchised, also looked upon him as their\\nfriend. Though his views on the tariff, internal improvements, and other\\nissues before the country were either vague or unknown, he was readily\\nelected President.\\n\\nThe returns of the electoral vote in 1828 revealed the sources of\\nJackson\\'s power. In New England, he received but one ballot, from\\nMaine; he had a majority of the electors in New York and all of them in\\nPennsylvania; and he carried every state south of Maryland and beyond\\nthe Appalachians. Adams did not get a single electoral vote in the South\\nand West. The prophecy of the Hartford convention had been fulfilled.\\n\\n[Illustration: ANDREW JACKSON]\\n\\nWhen Jackson took the oath of office on March 4, 1829, the government of\\nthe United States entered into a new era. Until this time the\\ninauguration of a President--even that of Jefferson, the apostle of\\nsimplicity--had brought no rude shock to the course of affairs at the\\ncapital. Hitherto the installation of a President meant that an\\nold-fashioned gentleman, accompanied by a few servants, had driven to\\nthe White House in his own coach, taken the oath with quiet dignity,\\nappointed a few new men to the higher posts, continued in office the\\nlong list of regular civil employees, and begun his administration with\\nrespectable decorum. Jackson changed all this. When he was inaugurated,\\nmen and women journeyed hundreds of miles to witness the ceremony. Great\\nthrongs pressed into the White House, \"upset the bowls of punch, broke\\nthe glasses, and stood with their muddy boots on the satin-covered\\nchairs to see the people\\'s President.\" If Jefferson\\'s inauguration was,\\nas he called it, the \"great revolution,\" Jackson\\'s inauguration was a\\ncataclysm.\\n\\n\\nTHE NEW DEMOCRACY AT WASHINGTON\\n\\n=The Spoils System.=--The staid and respectable society of Washington\\nwas disturbed by this influx of farmers and frontiersmen. To speak of\\npolitics became \"bad form\" among fashionable women. The clerks and\\ncivil servants of the government who had enjoyed long and secure tenure\\nof office became alarmed at the clamor of new men for their positions.\\nDoubtless the major portion of them had opposed the election of Jackson\\nand looked with feelings akin to contempt upon him and his followers.\\nWith a hunter\\'s instinct, Jackson scented his prey. Determined to have\\nnone but his friends in office, he made a clean sweep, expelling old\\nemployees to make room for men \"fresh from the people.\" This was a new\\ncustom. Other Presidents had discharged a few officers for engaging in\\nopposition politics. They had been careful in making appointments not to\\nchoose inveterate enemies; but they discharged relatively few men on\\naccount of their political views and partisan activities.\\n\\nBy wholesale removals and the frank selection of officers on party\\ngrounds--a practice already well intrenched in New York--Jackson\\nestablished the \"spoils system\" at Washington. The famous slogan, \"to\\nthe victor belong the spoils of victory,\" became the avowed principle of\\nthe national government. Statesmen like Calhoun denounced it; poets like\\nJames Russell Lowell ridiculed it; faithful servants of the government\\nsuffered under it; but it held undisturbed sway for half a century\\nthereafter, each succeeding generation outdoing, if possible, its\\npredecessor in the use of public office for political purposes. If any\\none remarked that training and experience were necessary qualifications\\nfor important public positions, he met Jackson\\'s own profession of\\nfaith: \"The duties of any public office are so simple or admit of being\\nmade so simple that any man can in a short time become master of them.\"\\n\\n=The Tariff and Nullification.=--Jackson had not been installed in power\\nvery long before he was compelled to choose between states\\' rights and\\nnationalism. The immediate occasion of the trouble was the tariff--a\\nmatter on which Jackson did not have any very decided views. His mind\\ndid not run naturally to abstruse economic questions; and owing to the\\ndivided opinion of the country it was \"good politics\" to be vague and\\nambiguous in the controversy. Especially was this true, because the\\ntariff issue was threatening to split the country into parties again.\\n\\n_The Development of the Policy of \"Protection.\"_--The war of 1812 and\\nthe commercial policies of England which followed it had accentuated the\\nneed for American economic independence. During that conflict, the\\nUnited States, cut off from English manufactures as during the\\nRevolution, built up home industries to meet the unusual call for iron,\\nsteel, cloth, and other military and naval supplies as well as the\\ndemands from ordinary markets. Iron foundries and textile mills sprang\\nup as in the night; hundreds of business men invested fortunes in\\nindustrial enterprises so essential to the military needs of the\\ngovernment; and the people at large fell into the habit of buying\\nAmerican-made goods again. As the London _Times_ tersely observed of the\\nAmericans, \"their first war with England made them independent; their\\nsecond war made them formidable.\"\\n\\nIn recognition of this state of affairs, the tariff of 1816 was\\ndesigned: _first_, to prevent England from ruining these \"infant\\nindustries\" by dumping the accumulated stores of years suddenly upon\\nAmerican markets; and, _secondly_, to enlarge in the manufacturing\\ncenters the demand for American agricultural produce. It accomplished\\nthe purposes of its framers. It kept in operation the mills and furnaces\\nso recently built. It multiplied the number of industrial workers and\\nenhanced the demand for the produce of the soil. It brought about\\nanother very important result. It turned the capital and enterprise of\\nNew England from shipping to manufacturing, and converted her statesmen,\\nonce friends of low tariffs, into ardent advocates of protection.\\n\\nIn the early years of the nineteenth century, the Yankees had bent their\\nenergies toward building and operating ships to carry produce from\\nAmerica to Europe and manufactures from Europe to America. For this\\nreason, they had opposed the tariff of 1816 calculated to increase\\ndomestic production and cut down the carrying trade. Defeated in their\\nefforts, they accepted the inevitable and turned to manufacturing. Soon\\nthey were powerful friends of protection for American enterprise. As the\\nmoney invested and the labor employed in the favored industries\\nincreased, the demand for continued and heavier protection grew apace.\\nEven the farmers who furnished raw materials, like wool, flax, and hemp,\\nbegan to see eye to eye with the manufacturers. So the textile interests\\nof New England, the iron masters of Connecticut, New Jersey, and\\nPennsylvania, the wool, hemp, and flax growers of Ohio, Kentucky, and\\nTennessee, and the sugar planters of Louisiana developed into a\\nformidable combination in support of a high protective tariff.\\n\\n_The Planting States Oppose the Tariff._--In the meantime, the cotton\\nstates on the seaboard had forgotten about the havoc wrought during the\\nNapoleonic wars when their produce rotted because there were no ships to\\ncarry it to Europe. The seas were now open. The area devoted to cotton\\nhad swiftly expanded as Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana were opened\\nup. Cotton had in fact become \"king\" and the planters depended for their\\nprosperity, as they thought, upon the sale of their staple to English\\nmanufacturers whose spinning and weaving mills were the wonder of the\\nworld. Manufacturing nothing and having to buy nearly everything except\\nfarm produce and even much of that for slaves, the planters naturally\\nwanted to purchase manufactures in the cheapest market, England, where\\nthey sold most of their cotton. The tariff, they contended, raised the\\nprice of the goods they had to buy and was thus in fact a tribute laid\\non them for the benefit of the Northern mill owners.\\n\\n_The Tariff of Abominations._--They were overborne, however, in 1824 and\\nagain in 1828 when Northern manufacturers and Western farmers forced\\nCongress to make an upward revision of the tariff. The Act of 1828 known\\nas \"the Tariff of Abominations,\" though slightly modified in 1832, was\\n\"the straw which broke the camel\\'s back.\" Southern leaders turned in\\nrage against the whole system. The legislatures of Virginia, North\\nCarolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama denounced it; a general\\nconvention of delegates held at Augusta issued a protest of defiance\\nagainst it; and South Carolina, weary of verbal battles, decided to\\nprevent its enforcement.\\n\\n_South Carolina Nullifies the Tariff._--The legislature of that state,\\non October 26, 1832, passed a bill calling for a state convention which\\nduly assembled in the following month. In no mood for compromise, it\\nadopted the famous Ordinance of Nullification after a few days\\' debate.\\nEvery line of this document was clear and firm. The tariff, it opened,\\ngives \"bounties to classes and individuals ... at the expense and to the\\ninjury and oppression of other classes and individuals\"; it is a\\nviolation of the Constitution of the United States and therefore null\\nand void; its enforcement in South Carolina is unlawful; if the federal\\ngovernment attempts to coerce the state into obeying the law, \"the\\npeople of this state will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all\\nfurther obligations to maintain or preserve their political connection\\nwith the people of the other states and will forthwith proceed to\\norganize a separate government and do all other acts and things which\\nsovereign and independent states may of right do.\"\\n\\n_Southern States Condemn Nullification._--The answer of the country to\\nthis note of defiance, couched in the language used in the Kentucky\\nresolutions and by the New England Federalists during the war of 1812,\\nwas quick and positive. The legislatures of the Southern states, while\\ncondemning the tariff, repudiated the step which South Carolina had\\ntaken. Georgia responded: \"We abhor the doctrine of nullification as\\nneither a peaceful nor a constitutional remedy.\" Alabama found it\\n\"unsound in theory and dangerous in practice.\" North Carolina replied\\nthat it was \"revolutionary in character, subversive of the Constitution\\nof the United States.\" Mississippi answered: \"It is disunion by\\nforce--it is civil war.\" Virginia spoke more softly, condemning the\\ntariff and sustaining the principle of the Virginia resolutions but\\ndenying that South Carolina could find in them any sanction for her\\nproceedings.\\n\\n_Jackson Firmly Upholds the Union._--The eyes of the country were turned\\nupon Andrew Jackson. It was known that he looked with no friendly\\nfeelings upon nullification, for, at a Jefferson dinner in the spring of\\n1830 while the subject was in the air, he had with laconic firmness\\nannounced a toast: \"Our federal union; it must be preserved.\" When two\\nyears later the open challenge came from South Carolina, he replied that\\nhe would enforce the law, saying with his frontier directness: \"If a\\nsingle drop of blood shall be shed there in opposition to the laws of\\nthe United States, I will hang the first man I can lay my hands on\\nengaged in such conduct upon the first tree that I can reach.\" He made\\nready to keep his word by preparing for the use of military and naval\\nforces in sustaining the authority of the federal government. Then in a\\nlong and impassioned proclamation to the people of South Carolina he\\npointed out the national character of the union, and announced his\\nsolemn resolve to preserve it by all constitutional means. Nullification\\nhe branded as \"incompatible with the existence of the union,\\ncontradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized\\nby its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was\\nfounded, and destructive of the great objects for which it was formed.\"\\n\\n_A Compromise._--In his messages to Congress, however, Jackson spoke the\\nlanguage of conciliation. A few days before issuing his proclamation he\\nsuggested that protection should be limited to the articles of domestic\\nmanufacture indispensable to safety in war time, and shortly afterward\\nhe asked for new legislation to aid him in enforcing the laws. With two\\npropositions before it, one to remove the chief grounds for South\\nCarolina\\'s resistance and the other to apply force if it was continued,\\nCongress bent its efforts to avoid a crisis. On February 12, 1833,\\nHenry Clay laid before the Senate a compromise tariff bill providing for\\nthe gradual reduction of the duties until by 1842 they would reach the\\nlevel of the law which Calhoun had supported in 1816. About the same\\ntime the \"force bill,\" designed to give the President ample authority in\\nexecuting the law in South Carolina, was taken up. After a short but\\nacrimonious debate, both measures were passed and signed by President\\nJackson on the same day, March 2. Looking upon the reduction of the\\ntariff as a complete vindication of her policy and an undoubted victory,\\nSouth Carolina rescinded her ordinance and enacted another nullifying\\nthe force bill.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print._\\n\\nDANIEL WEBSTER]\\n\\n_The Webster-Hayne Debate._--Where the actual victory lay in this\\nquarrel, long the subject of high dispute, need not concern us to-day.\\nPerhaps the chief result of the whole affair was a clarification of the\\nissue between the North and the South--a definite statement of the\\nprinciples for which men on both sides were years afterward to lay down\\ntheir lives. On behalf of nationalism and a perpetual union, the stanch\\nold Democrat from Tennessee had, in his proclamation on nullification,\\nspoken a language that admitted of only one meaning. On behalf of\\nnullification, Senator Hayne, of South Carolina, a skilled lawyer and\\ncourtly orator, had in a great speech delivered in the Senate in\\nJanuary, 1830, set forth clearly and cogently the doctrine that the\\nunion is a compact among sovereign states from which the parties may\\nlawfully withdraw. It was this address that called into the arena\\nDaniel Webster, Senator from Massachusetts, who, spreading the mantle\\nof oblivion over the Hartford convention, delivered a reply to Hayne\\nthat has been reckoned among the powerful orations of all time--a plea\\nfor the supremacy of the Constitution and the national character of the\\nunion.\\n\\n=The War on the United States Bank.=--If events forced the issue of\\nnationalism and nullification upon Jackson, the same could not be said\\nof his attack on the bank. That institution, once denounced by every\\ntrue Jeffersonian, had been reestablished in 1816 under the\\nadministration of Jefferson\\'s disciple, James Madison. It had not been\\nin operation very long, however, before it aroused bitter opposition,\\nespecially in the South and the West. Its notes drove out of circulation\\nthe paper currency of unsound banks chartered by the states, to the\\ngreat anger of local financiers. It was accused of favoritism in making\\nloans, of conferring special privileges upon politicians in return for\\ntheir support at Washington. To all Jackson\\'s followers it was \"an\\ninsidious money power.\" One of them openly denounced it as an\\ninstitution designed \"to strengthen the arm of wealth and counterpoise\\nthe influence of extended suffrage in the disposition of public\\naffairs.\"\\n\\nThis sentiment President Jackson fully shared. In his first message to\\nCongress he assailed the bank in vigorous language. He declared that its\\nconstitutionality was in doubt and alleged that it had failed to\\nestablish a sound and uniform currency. If such an institution was\\nnecessary, he continued, it should be a public bank, owned and managed\\nby the government, not a private concern endowed with special privileges\\nby it. In his second and third messages, Jackson came back to the\\nsubject, leaving the decision, however, to \"an enlightened people and\\ntheir representatives.\"\\n\\nMoved by this frank hostility and anxious for the future, the bank\\napplied to Congress for a renewal of its charter in 1832, four years\\nbefore the expiration of its life. Clay, with his eye upon the\\npresidency and an issue for the campaign, warmly supported the\\napplication. Congress, deeply impressed by his leadership, passed the\\nbill granting the new charter, and sent the open defiance to Jackson.\\nHis response was an instant veto. The battle was on and it raged with\\nfury until the close of his second administration, ending in the\\ndestruction of the bank, a disordered currency, and a national panic.\\n\\nIn his veto message, Jackson attacked the bank as unconstitutional and\\neven hinted at corruption. He refused to assent to the proposition that\\nthe Supreme Court had settled the question of constitutionality by the\\ndecision in the McCulloch case. \"Each public officer,\" he argued, \"who\\ntakes an oath to support the Constitution, swears that he will support\\nit as he understands it, not as it is understood by others.\"\\n\\nNot satisfied with his veto and his declaration against the bank,\\nJackson ordered the Secretary of the Treasury to withdraw the government\\ndeposits which formed a large part of the institution\\'s funds. This\\naction he followed up by an open charge that the bank had used money\\nshamefully to secure the return of its supporters to Congress. The\\nSenate, stung by this charge, solemnly resolved that Jackson had\\n\"assumed upon himself authority and power not conferred by the\\nConstitution and laws, but in derogation of both.\"\\n\\nThe effects of the destruction of the bank were widespread. When its\\ncharter expired in 1836, banking was once more committed to the control\\nof the states. The state legislatures, under a decision rendered by the\\nSupreme Court after the death of Marshall, began to charter banks under\\nstate ownership and control, with full power to issue paper money--this\\nin spite of the provision in the Constitution that states shall not\\nissue bills of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin legal\\ntender in the payment of debts. Once more the country was flooded by\\npaper currency of uncertain value. To make matters worse, Jackson\\nadopted the practice of depositing huge amounts of government funds in\\nthese banks, not forgetting to render favors to those institutions which\\nsupported him in politics--\"pet banks,\" as they were styled at the\\ntime. In 1837, partially, though by no means entirely, as a result of\\nthe abolition of the bank, the country was plunged into one of the most\\ndisastrous panics which it ever experienced.\\n\\n=Internal Improvements Checked.=--The bank had presented to Jackson a\\nvery clear problem--one of destruction. Other questions were not so\\nsimple, particularly the subject of federal appropriations in aid of\\nroads and other internal improvements. Jefferson had strongly favored\\ngovernment assistance in such matters, but his administration was\\nfollowed by a reaction. Both Madison and Monroe vetoed acts of Congress\\nappropriating public funds for public roads, advancing as their reason\\nthe argument that the Constitution authorized no such laws. Jackson,\\npuzzled by the clamor on both sides, followed their example without\\nmaking the constitutional bar absolute. Congress, he thought, might\\nlawfully build highways of a national and military value, but he\\nstrongly deprecated attacks by local interests on the federal treasury.\\n\\n=The Triumph of the Executive Branch.=--Jackson\\'s reelection in 1832\\nserved to confirm his opinion that he was the chosen leader of the\\npeople, freed and instructed to ride rough shod over Congress and even\\nthe courts. No President before or since ever entertained in times of\\npeace such lofty notions of executive prerogative. The entire body of\\nfederal employees he transformed into obedient servants of his wishes, a\\nsign or a nod from him making and undoing the fortunes of the humble and\\nthe mighty. His lawful cabinet of advisers, filling all of the high\\nposts in the government, he treated with scant courtesy, preferring\\nrather to secure his counsel and advice from an unofficial body of\\nfriends and dependents who, owing to their secret methods and back\\nstairs arrangements, became known as \"the kitchen cabinet.\" Under the\\nleadership of a silent, astute, and resourceful politician, Amos\\nKendall, this informal gathering of the faithful both gave and carried\\nout decrees and orders, communicating the President\\'s lightest wish or\\nstrictest command to the uttermost part of the country. Resolutely and\\nin the face of bitter opposition Jackson had removed the deposits from\\nthe United States Bank. When the Senate protested against this arbitrary\\nconduct, he did not rest until it was forced to expunge the resolution\\nof condemnation; in time one of his lieutenants with his own hands was\\nable to tear the censure from the records. When Chief Justice Marshall\\nissued a decree against Georgia which did not suit him, Jackson,\\naccording to tradition, blurted out that Marshall could go ahead and\\nenforce his own orders. To the end he pursued his willful way, finally\\neven choosing his own successor.\\n\\n\\nTHE RISE OF THE WHIGS\\n\\n=Jackson\\'s Measures Arouse Opposition.=--Measures so decided, policies\\nso radical, and conduct so high-handed could not fail to arouse against\\nJackson a deep and exasperated opposition. The truth is the conduct of\\nhis entire administration profoundly disturbed the business and finances\\nof the country. It was accompanied by conditions similar to those which\\nexisted under the Articles of Confederation. A paper currency, almost as\\nunstable and irritating as the worthless notes of revolutionary days,\\nflooded the country, hindering the easy transaction of business. The use\\nof federal funds for internal improvements, so vital to the exchange of\\ncommodities which is the very life of industry, was blocked by executive\\nvetoes. The Supreme Court, which, under Marshall, had held refractory\\nstates to their obligations under the Constitution, was flouted; states\\'\\nrights judges, deliberately selected by Jackson for the bench, began to\\nsap and undermine the rulings of Marshall. The protective tariff, under\\nwhich the textile industry of New England, the iron mills of\\nPennsylvania, and the wool, flax, and hemp farms of the West had\\nflourished, had received a severe blow in the compromise of 1833 which\\npromised a steady reduction of duties. To cap the climax, Jackson\\'s\\nparty, casting aside the old and reputable name of Republican, boldly\\nchose for its title the term \"Democrat,\" throwing down the gauntlet to\\nevery conservative who doubted the omniscience of the people. All these\\nthings worked together to evoke an opposition that was sharp and\\ndetermined.\\n\\n[Illustration: AN OLD CARTOON RIDICULING CLAY\\'S TARIFF AND INTERNAL\\nIMPROVEMENT PROGRAM]\\n\\n=Clay and the National Republicans.=--In this opposition movement,\\nleadership fell to Henry Clay, a son of Kentucky, rather than to Daniel\\nWebster of Massachusetts. Like Jackson, Clay was born in a home haunted\\nby poverty. Left fatherless early and thrown upon his own resources, he\\nwent from Virginia into Kentucky where by sheer force of intellect he\\nrose to eminence in the profession of law. Without the martial gifts or\\nthe martial spirit of Jackson, he slipped more easily into the social\\nhabits of the East at the same time that he retained his hold on the\\naffections of the boisterous West. Farmers of Ohio, Indiana, and\\nKentucky loved him; financiers of New York and Philadelphia trusted him.\\nHe was thus a leader well fitted to gather the forces of opposition\\ninto union against Jackson.\\n\\nAround Clay\\'s standard assembled a motley collection, representing every\\nspecies of political opinion, united by one tie only--hatred for \"Old\\nHickory.\" Nullifiers and less strenuous advocates of states\\' rights were\\nyoked with nationalists of Webster\\'s school; ardent protectionists were\\nbound together with equally ardent free traders, all fraternizing in one\\ngrand confusion of ideas under the title of \"National Republicans.\" Thus\\nthe ancient and honorable term selected by Jefferson and his party, now\\nabandoned by Jacksonian Democracy, was adroitly adopted to cover the\\nsupporters of Clay. The platform of the party, however, embraced all the\\nold Federalist principles: protection for American industry; internal\\nimprovements; respect for the Supreme Court; resistance to executive\\ntyranny; and denunciation of the spoils system. Though Jackson was\\neasily victorious in 1832, the popular vote cast for Clay should have\\ngiven him some doubts about the faith of \"the whole people\" in the\\nwisdom of his \"reign.\"\\n\\n=Van Buren and the Panic of 1837.=--Nothing could shake the General\\'s\\nsuperb confidence. At the end of his second term he insisted on\\nselecting his own successor; at a national convention, chosen by party\\nvoters, but packed with his office holders and friends, he nominated\\nMartin Van Buren of New York. Once more he proved his strength by\\ncarrying the country for the Democrats. With a fine flourish, he\\nattended the inauguration of Van Buren and then retired, amid the\\napplause and tears of his devotees, to the Hermitage, his home in\\nTennessee.\\n\\nFortunately for him, Jackson escaped the odium of a disastrous panic\\nwhich struck the country with terrible force in the following summer.\\nAmong the contributory causes of this crisis, no doubt, were the\\ndestruction of the bank and the issuance of the \"specie circular\" of\\n\\n1836 which required the purchasers of public lands to pay for them in\\ncoin, instead of the paper notes of state banks. Whatever the dominating\\ncause, the ruin was widespread. Bank after bank went under; boom towns\\nin the West collapsed; Eastern mills shut down; and working people in\\nthe industrial centers, starving from unemployment, begged for relief.\\nVan Buren braved the storm, offering no measure of reform or assistance\\nto the distracted people. He did seek security for government funds by\\nsuggesting the removal of deposits from private banks and the\\nestablishment of an independent treasury system, with government\\ndepositaries for public funds, in several leading cities. This plan was\\nfinally accepted by Congress in 1840.\\n\\nHad Van Buren been a captivating figure he might have lived down the\\ndiscredit of the panic unjustly laid at his door; but he was far from\\nbeing a favorite with the populace. Though a man of many talents, he\\nowed his position to the quiet and adept management of Jackson rather\\nthan to his own personal qualities. The men of the frontier did not care\\nfor him. They suspected that he ate from \"gold plate\" and they could not\\nforgive him for being an astute politician from New York. Still the\\nDemocratic party, remembering Jackson\\'s wishes, renominated him\\nunanimously in 1840 and saw him go down to utter defeat.\\n\\n=The Whigs and General Harrison.=--By this time, the National\\nRepublicans, now known as Whigs--a title taken from the party of\\nopposition to the Crown in England, had learned many lessons. Taking a\\nleaf out of the Democratic book, they nominated, not Clay of Kentucky,\\nwell known for his views on the bank, the tariff, and internal\\nimprovements, but a military hero, General William Henry Harrison, a man\\nof uncertain political opinions. Harrison, a son of a Virginia signer of\\nthe Declaration of Independence, sprang into public view by winning a\\nbattle more famous than important, \"Tippecanoe\"--a brush with the\\nIndians in Indiana. He added to his laurels by rendering praiseworthy\\nservices during the war of 1812. When days of peace returned he was\\nrewarded by a grateful people with a seat in Congress. Then he retired\\nto quiet life in a little village near Cincinnati. Like Jackson he was\\nheld to be a son of the South and the West. Like Jackson he was a\\nmilitary hero, a lesser light, but still a light. Like Old Hickory he\\nrode into office on a tide of popular feeling against an Eastern man\\naccused of being something of an aristocrat. His personal popularity was\\nsufficient. The Whigs who nominated him shrewdly refused to adopt a\\nplatform or declare their belief in anything. When some Democrat\\nasserted that Harrison was a backwoodsman whose sole wants were a jug of\\nhard cider and a log cabin, the Whigs treated the remark not as an\\ninsult but as proof positive that Harrison deserved the votes of Jackson\\nmen. The jug and the cabin they proudly transformed into symbols of the\\ncampaign, and won for their chieftain 234 electoral votes, while Van\\nBuren got only sixty.\\n\\n=Harrison and Tyler.=--The Hero of Tippecanoe was not long to enjoy the\\nfruits of his victory. The hungry horde of Whig office seekers descended\\nupon him like wolves upon the fold. If he went out they waylaid him; if\\nhe stayed indoors, he was besieged; not even his bed chamber was spared.\\nHe was none too strong at best and he took a deep cold on the day of his\\ninauguration. Between driving out Democrats and appeasing Whigs, he fell\\nmortally ill. Before the end of a month he lay dead at the capitol.\\n\\nHarrison\\'s successor, John Tyler, the Vice President, whom the Whigs had\\nnominated to catch votes in Virginia, was more of a Democrat than\\nanything else, though he was not partisan enough to please anybody. The\\nWhigs railed at him because he would not approve the founding of another\\nUnited States Bank. The Democrats stormed at him for refusing, until\\nnear the end of his term, to sanction the annexation of Texas, which had\\ndeclared its independence of Mexico in 1836. His entire administration,\\nmarked by unseemly wrangling, produced only two measures of importance.\\nThe Whigs, flushed by victory, with the aid of a few protectionist\\nDemocrats, enacted, in 1842, a new tariff law destroying the compromise\\nwhich had brought about the truce between the North and the South, in\\nthe days of nullification. The distinguished leader of the Whigs, Daniel\\nWebster, as Secretary of State, in negotiation with Lord Ashburton\\nrepresenting Great Britain, settled the long-standing dispute between\\nthe two countries over the Maine boundary. A year after closing this\\nchapter in American diplomacy, Webster withdrew to private life, leaving\\nthe President to endure alone the buffets of political fortune.\\n\\nTo the end, the Whigs regarded Tyler as a traitor to their cause; but\\nthe judgment of history is that it was a case of the biter bitten. They\\nhad nominated him for the vice presidency as a man of views acceptable\\nto Southern Democrats in order to catch their votes, little reckoning\\nwith the chances of his becoming President. Tyler had not deceived them\\nand, thoroughly soured, he left the White House in 1845 not to appear in\\npublic life again until the days of secession, when he espoused the\\nSouthern confederacy. Jacksonian Democracy, with new leadership, serving\\na new cause--slavery--was returned to power under James K. Polk, a\\nfriend of the General from Tennessee. A few grains of sand were to run\\nthrough the hour glass before the Whig party was to be broken and\\nscattered as the Federalists had been more than a generation before.\\n\\n\\nTHE INTERACTION OF AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN OPINION\\n\\n=Democracy in England and France.=--During the period of Jacksonian\\nDemocracy, as in all epochs of ferment, there was a close relation\\nbetween the thought of the New World and the Old. In England, the\\nsuccesses of the American experiment were used as arguments in favor of\\noverthrowing the aristocracy which George III had manipulated with such\\neffect against America half a century before. In the United States, on\\nthe other hand, conservatives like Chancellor Kent, the stout opponent\\nof manhood suffrage in New York, cited the riots of the British working\\nclasses as a warning against admitting the same classes to a share in\\nthe government of the United States. Along with the agitation of opinion\\nwent epoch-making events. In 1832, the year of Jackson\\'s second\\ntriumph, the British Parliament passed its first reform bill, which\\nconferred the ballot--not on workingmen as yet--but on mill owners and\\nshopkeepers whom the landlords regarded with genuine horror. The initial\\nstep was thus taken in breaking down the privileges of the landed\\naristocracy and the rich merchants of England.\\n\\nAbout the same time a popular revolution occurred in France. The Bourbon\\nfamily, restored to the throne of France by the allied powers after\\ntheir victory over Napoleon in 1815, had embarked upon a policy of\\narbitrary government. To use the familiar phrase, they had learned\\nnothing and forgotten nothing. Charles X, who came to the throne in\\n1824, set to work with zeal to undo the results of the French\\nRevolution, to stifle the press, restrict the suffrage, and restore the\\nclergy and the nobility to their ancient rights. His policy encountered\\nequally zealous opposition and in 1830 he was overthrown. The popular\\nparty, under the leadership of Lafayette, established, not a republic as\\nsome of the radicals had hoped, but a \"liberal\" middle-class monarchy\\nunder Louis Philippe. This second French Revolution made a profound\\nimpression on Americans, convincing them that the whole world was moving\\ntoward democracy. The mayor, aldermen, and citizens of New York City\\njoined in a great parade to celebrate the fall of the Bourbons. Mingled\\nwith cheers for the new order in France were hurrahs for \"the people\\'s\\nown, Andrew Jackson, the Hero of New Orleans and President of the United\\nStates!\"\\n\\n=European Interest in America.=--To the older and more settled\\nEuropeans, the democratic experiment in America was either a menace or\\nan inspiration. Conservatives viewed it with anxiety; liberals with\\noptimism. Far-sighted leaders could see that the tide of democracy was\\nrising all over the world and could not be stayed. Naturally the country\\nthat had advanced furthest along the new course was the place in which\\nto find arguments for and against proposals that Europe should make\\nexperiments of the same character.\\n\\n=De Tocqueville\\'s _Democracy in America_.=--In addition to the casual\\ntraveler there began to visit the United States the thoughtful observer\\nbent on finding out what manner of nation this was springing up in the\\nwilderness. Those who looked with sympathy upon the growing popular\\nforces of England and France found in the United States, in spite of\\nmany blemishes and defects, a guarantee for the future of the people\\'s\\nrule in the Old World. One of these, Alexis de Tocqueville, a French\\nliberal of mildly democratic sympathies, made a journey to this country\\nin 1831; he described in a very remarkable volume, _Democracy in\\nAmerica_, the grand experiment as he saw it. On the whole he was\\nconvinced. After examining with a critical eye the life and labor of the\\nAmerican people, as well as the constitutions of the states and the\\nnation, he came to the conclusion that democracy with all its faults was\\nboth inevitable and successful. Slavery he thought was a painful\\ncontrast to the other features of American life, and he foresaw what\\nproved to be the irrepressible conflict over it. He believed that\\nthrough blundering the people were destined to learn the highest of all\\narts, self-government on a grand scale. The absence of a leisure class,\\ndevoted to no calling or profession, merely enjoying the refinements of\\nlife and adding to its graces--the flaw in American culture that gave\\ndeep distress to many a European leader--de Tocqueville thought a\\nnecessary virtue in the republic. \"Amongst a democratic people where\\nthere is no hereditary wealth, every man works to earn a living, or has\\nworked, or is born of parents who have worked. A notion of labor is\\ntherefore presented to the mind on every side as the necessary, natural,\\nand honest condition of human existence.\" It was this notion of a\\ngovernment in the hands of people who labored that struck the French\\npublicist as the most significant fact in the modern world.\\n\\n=Harriet Martineau\\'s Visit to America.=--This phase of American life\\nalso profoundly impressed the brilliant English writer, Harriet\\nMartineau. She saw all parts of the country, the homes of the rich and\\nthe log cabins of the frontier; she traveled in stagecoaches, canal\\nboats, and on horseback; and visited sessions of Congress and auctions\\nat slave markets. She tried to view the country impartially and the\\nthing that left the deepest mark on her mind was the solidarity of the\\npeople in one great political body. \"However various may be the tribes\\nof inhabitants in those states, whatever part of the world may have been\\ntheir birthplace, or that of their fathers, however broken may be their\\nlanguage, however servile or noble their employments, however exalted or\\ndespised their state, all are declared to be bound together by equal\\npolitical obligations.... In that self-governing country all are held to\\nhave an equal interest in the principles of its institutions and to be\\nbound in equal duty to watch their workings.\" Miss Martineau was also\\nimpressed with the passion of Americans for land ownership and\\ncontrasted the United States favorably with England where the tillers of\\nthe soil were either tenants or laborers for wages.\\n\\n=Adverse Criticism.=--By no means all observers and writers were\\nconvinced that America was a success. The fastidious traveler, Mrs.\\nTrollope, who thought the English system of church and state was ideal,\\nsaw in the United States only roughness and ignorance. She lamented the\\n\"total and universal want of manners both in males and females,\" adding\\nthat while \"they appear to have clear heads and active intellects,\"\\nthere was \"no charm, no grace in their conversation.\" She found\\neverywhere a lack of reverence for kings, learning, and rank. Other\\ncritics were even more savage. The editor of the _Foreign Quarterly_\\npetulantly exclaimed that the United States was \"a brigand\\nconfederation.\" Charles Dickens declared the country to be \"so maimed\\nand lame, so full of sores and ulcers that her best friends turn from\\nthe loathsome creature in disgust.\" Sydney Smith, editor of the\\n_Edinburgh Review_, was never tired of trying his caustic wit at the\\nexpense of America. \"Their Franklins and Washingtons and all the other\\nsages and heroes of their revolution were born and bred subjects of the\\nking of England,\" he observed in 1820. \"During the thirty or forty\\nyears of their independence they have done absolutely nothing for the\\nsciences, for the arts, for literature, or even for the statesmanlike\\nstudies of politics or political economy.... In the four quarters of the\\nglobe who reads an American book? Or goes to an American play? Or looks\\nat an American picture or statue?\" To put a sharp sting into his taunt\\nhe added, forgetting by whose authority slavery was introduced and\\nfostered: \"Under which of the old tyrannical governments of Europe is\\nevery sixth man a slave whom his fellow creatures may buy and sell?\"\\n\\nSome Americans, while resenting the hasty and often superficial\\njudgments of European writers, winced under their satire and took\\nthought about certain particulars in the indictments brought against\\nthem. The mass of the people, however, bent on the great experiment,\\ngave little heed to carping critics who saw the flaws and not the\\nachievements of our country--critics who were in fact less interested in\\nAmerica than in preventing the rise and growth of democracy in Europe.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nJ.S.

When he made this astounding declaration, he doubtless had\\nbefore his mind\\'s eye the great stretches of unoccupied lands between\\nthe Appalachians and the Mississippi. He also had before him the history\\nof the English colonies, which told him of the two centuries required to\\nsettle the seaboard region. To practical men, his prophecy did not seem\\nfar wrong; but before the lapse of half that time there appeared beyond\\nthe Mississippi a tier of new states, reaching from the Gulf of Mexico\\nto the southern boundary of Minnesota, and a new commonwealth on the\\nPacific Ocean where American emigrants had raised the Bear flag of\\nCalifornia.\\n\\n\\nTHE ADVANCE OF THE MIDDLE BORDER\\n\\n=Missouri.=--When the middle of the nineteenth century had been reached,\\nthe Mississippi River, which Daniel Boone, the intrepid hunter, had\\ncrossed during Washington\\'s administration \"to escape from civilization\"\\nin Kentucky, had become the waterway for a vast empire. The center of\\npopulation of the United States had passed to the Ohio Valley. Missouri,\\nwith its wide reaches of rich lands, low-lying, level, and fertile, well\\nadapted to hemp raising, had drawn to its borders thousands of planters\\nfrom the old Southern states--from Virginia and the Carolinas as well as\\nfrom Kentucky and Tennessee. When the great compromise of 1820-21\\nadmitted her to the union, wearing \"every jewel of sovereignty,\" as a\\nflorid orator announced, migratory slave owners were assured that their\\nproperty would be safe in Missouri. Along the western shore of the\\nMississippi and on both banks of the Missouri to the uttermost limits of\\nthe state, plantations tilled by bondmen spread out in broad expanses.\\nIn the neighborhood of Jefferson City the slaves numbered more than a\\nfourth of the population.\\n\\nInto this stream of migration from the planting South flowed another\\ncurrent of land-tilling farmers; some from Kentucky, Tennessee, and\\nMississippi, driven out by the onrush of the planters buying and\\nconsolidating small farms into vast estates; and still more from the\\nEast and the Old World. To the northwest over against Iowa and to the\\nsouthwest against Arkansas, these yeomen laid out farms to be tilled by\\ntheir own labor. In those regions the number of slaves seldom rose above\\nfive or six per cent of the population. The old French post, St. Louis,\\nenriched by the fur trade of the Far West and the steamboat traffic of\\nthe river, grew into a thriving commercial city, including among its\\nseventy-five thousand inhabitants in 1850 nearly forty thousand\\nforeigners, German immigrants from Pennsylvania and Europe being the\\nlargest single element.\\n\\n=Arkansas.=--Below Missouri lay the territory of Arkansas, which had\\nlong been the paradise of the swarthy hunter and the restless\\nfrontiersman fleeing from the advancing borders of farm and town. In\\nsearch of the life, wild and free, where the rifle supplied the game and\\na few acres of ground the corn and potatoes, they had filtered into the\\nterritory in an unending drift, \"squatting\" on the land. Without so much\\nas asking the leave of any government, territorial or national, they\\nclaimed as their own the soil on which they first planted their feet.\\nLike the Cherokee Indians, whom they had as neighbors, whose very\\ncustoms and dress they sometimes adopted, the squatters spent their days\\nin the midst of rough plenty, beset by chills, fevers, and the ills of\\nthe flesh, but for many years unvexed by political troubles or the\\nrestrictions of civilized life.\\n\\nUnfortunately for them, however, the fertile valleys of the Mississippi\\nand Arkansas were well adapted to the cultivation of cotton and tobacco\\nand their sylvan peace was soon broken by an invasion of planters. The\\nnewcomers, with their servile workers, spread upward in the valley\\ntoward Missouri and along the southern border westward to the Red River.\\nIn time the slaves in the tier of counties against Louisiana ranged from\\nthirty to seventy per cent of the population. This marked the doom of\\nthe small farmer, swept Arkansas into the main current of planting\\npolitics, and led to a powerful lobby at Washington in favor of\\nadmission to the union, a boon granted in 1836.\\n\\n=Michigan.=--In accordance with a well-established custom, a free state\\nwas admitted to the union to balance a slave state. In 1833, the people\\nof Michigan, a territory ten times the size of Connecticut, announced\\nthat the time had come for them to enjoy the privileges of a\\ncommonwealth. All along the southern border the land had been occupied\\nlargely by pioneers from New England, who built prim farmhouses and\\nadopted the town-meeting plan of self-government after the fashion of\\nthe old home. The famous post of Detroit was growing into a flourishing\\ncity as the boats plying on the Great Lakes carried travelers, settlers,\\nand freight through the narrows. In all, according to the census, there\\nwere more than ninety thousand inhabitants in the territory; so it was\\nnot without warrant that they clamored for statehood. Congress, busy as\\never with politics, delayed; and the inhabitants of Michigan, unable to\\nrestrain their impatience, called a convention, drew up a constitution,\\nand started a lively quarrel with Ohio over the southern boundary. The\\nhand of Congress was now forced. Objections were made to the new\\nconstitution on the ground that it gave the ballot to all free white\\nmales, including aliens not yet naturalized; but the protests were\\noverborne in a long debate. The boundary was fixed, and Michigan, though\\nshorn of some of the land she claimed, came into the union in 1837.\\n\\n=Wisconsin.=--Across Lake Michigan to the west lay the territory of\\nWisconsin, which shared with Michigan the interesting history of the\\nNorthwest, running back into the heroic days when French hunters and\\nmissionaries were planning a French empire for the great monarch, Louis\\nXIV. It will not be forgotten that the French rangers of the woods, the\\nblack-robed priests, prepared for sacrifice, even to death, the trappers\\nof the French agencies, and the French explorers--Marquette, Joliet, and\\nMenard--were the first white men to paddle their frail barks through the\\nnorthern waters. They first blazed their trails into the black forests\\nand left traces of their work in the names of portages and little\\nvillages. It was from these forests that Red Men in full war paint\\njourneyed far to fight under the _fleur-de-lis_ of France when the\\nsoldiers of King Louis made their last stand at Quebec and Montreal\\nagainst the imperial arms of Britain. It was here that the British flag\\nwas planted in 1761 and that the great Pontiac conspiracy was formed two\\nyears later to overthrow British dominion.\\n\\nWhen, a generation afterward, the Stars and Stripes supplanted the Union\\nJack, the French were still almost the only white men in the region.\\nThey were soon joined by hustling Yankee fur traders who did battle\\nroyal against British interlopers. The traders cut their way through\\nforest trails and laid out the routes through lake and stream and over\\nportages for the settlers and their families from the states \"back\\nEast.\" It was the forest ranger who discovered the water power later\\nused to turn the busy mills grinding the grain from the spreading farm\\nlands. In the wake of the fur hunters, forest men, and farmers came\\nminers from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri crowding in to exploit the\\nlead ores of the northwest, some of them bringing slaves to work their\\nclaims. Had it not been for the gold fever of 1849 that drew the\\nwielders of pick and shovel to the Far West, Wisconsin would early have\\ntaken high rank among the mining regions of the country.\\n\\nFrom a favorable point of vantage on Lake Michigan, the village of\\nMilwaukee, a center for lumber and grain transport and a place of entry\\nfor Eastern goods, grew into a thriving city. It claimed twenty thousand\\ninhabitants, when in 1848 Congress admitted Wisconsin to the union.\\nAlready the Germans, Irish, and Scandinavians had found their way into\\nthe territory. They joined Americans from the older states in clearing\\nforests, building roads, transforming trails into highways, erecting\\nmills, and connecting streams with canals to make a network of routes\\nfor the traffic that poured to and from the Great Lakes.\\n\\n=Iowa and Minnesota.=--To the southwest of Wisconsin beyond the\\nMississippi, where the tall grass of the prairies waved like the sea,\\nfarmers from New England, New York, and Ohio had prepared Iowa for\\nstatehood. A tide of immigration that might have flowed into Missouri\\nwent northward; for freemen, unaccustomed to slavery and slave markets,\\npreferred the open country above the compromise line. With incredible\\nswiftness, they spread farms westward from the Mississippi. With Yankee\\ningenuity they turned to trading on the river, building before 1836\\nthree prosperous centers of traffic: Dubuque, Davenport, and Burlington.\\nTrue to their old traditions, they founded colleges and academies that\\nreligion and learning might be cherished on the frontier as in the\\nstates from which they came. Prepared for self-government, the Iowans\\nlaid siege to the door of Congress and were admitted to the union in\\n1846.\\n\\nAbove Iowa, on the Mississippi, lay the territory of Minnesota--the home\\nof the Dakotas, the Ojibways, and the Sioux. Like Michigan and\\nWisconsin, it had been explored early by the French scouts, and the\\nfirst white settlement was the little French village of Mendota. To the\\npeople of the United States, the resources of the country were first\\nrevealed by the historic journey of Zebulon Pike in 1805 and by American\\nfur traders who were quick to take advantage of the opportunity to ply\\ntheir arts of hunting and bartering in fresh fields. In 1839 an\\nAmerican settlement was planted at Marina on the St. Croix, the outpost\\nof advancing civilization. Within twenty years, the territory, boasting\\na population of 150,000, asked for admission to the union. In 1858 the\\nplea was granted and Minnesota showed her gratitude three years later by\\nbeing first among the states to offer troops to Lincoln in the hour of\\nperil.\\n\\n\\nON TO THE PACIFIC--TEXAS AND THE MEXICAN WAR\\n\\n=The Uniformity of the Middle West.=--There was a certain monotony about\\npioneering in the Northwest and on the middle border. As the long\\nstretches of land were cleared or prepared for the plow, they were laid\\nout like checkerboards into squares of forty, eighty, one hundred sixty,\\nor more acres, each the seat of a homestead. There was a striking\\nuniformity also about the endless succession of fertile fields spreading\\nfar and wide under the hot summer sun. No majestic mountains relieved\\nthe sweep of the prairie. Few monuments of other races and antiquity\\nwere there to awaken curiosity about the region. No sonorous bells in\\nold missions rang out the time of day. The chaffering Red Man bartering\\nblankets and furs for powder and whisky had passed farther on. The\\npopulation was made up of plain farmers and their families engaged in\\nsevere and unbroken labor, chopping down trees, draining fever-breeding\\nswamps, breaking new ground, and planting from year to year the same\\nrotation of crops. Nearly all the settlers were of native American stock\\ninto whose frugal and industrious lives the later Irish and German\\nimmigrants fitted, on the whole, with little friction. Even the Dutch\\noven fell before the cast-iron cooking stove. Happiness and sorrow,\\ndespair and hope were there, but all encompassed by the heavy tedium of\\nprosaic sameness.\\n\\n[Illustration: SANTA BARBARA MISSION]\\n\\n=A Contrast in the Far West and Southwest.=--As George Rogers Clark and\\nDaniel Boone had stirred the snug Americans of the seaboard to seek\\ntheir fortunes beyond the Appalachians, so now Kit Carson, James Bowie,\\nSam Houston, Davy Crockett, and John C. Fremont were to lead the way\\ninto a new land, only a part of which was under the American flag. The\\nsetting for this new scene in the westward movement was thrown out in a\\nwide sweep from the headwaters of the Mississippi to the banks of the\\nRio Grande; from the valleys of the Sabine and Red rivers to Montana and\\nthe Pacific slope. In comparison with the middle border, this region\\npresented such startling diversities that only the eye of faith could\\nforesee the unifying power of nationalism binding its communities with\\nthe older sections of the country. What contrasts indeed! The blue grass\\nregion of Kentucky or the rich, black soil of Illinois--the painted\\ndesert, the home of the sage brush and the coyote! The level prairies of\\nIowa--the mighty Rockies shouldering themselves high against the\\nhorizon! The long bleak winters of Wisconsin--California of endless\\nsummer! The log churches of Indiana or Illinois--the quaint missions of\\nSan Antonio, Tucson, and Santa Barbara! The little state of\\nDelaware--the empire of Texas, one hundred and twenty times its area!\\nAnd scattered about through the Southwest were signs of an ancient\\ncivilization--fragments of four-and five-story dwellings, ruined dams,\\naqueducts, and broken canals, which told of once prosperous peoples\\nwho, by art and science, had conquered the aridity of the desert and\\nlifted themselves in the scale of culture above the savages of the\\nplain.\\n\\nThe settlers of this vast empire were to be as diverse in their origins\\nand habits as those of the colonies on the coast had been. Americans of\\nEnglish, Irish, and Scotch-Irish descent came as usual from the Eastern\\nstates. To them were added the migratory Germans as well. Now for the\\nfirst time came throngs of Scandinavians. Some were to make their homes\\non quiet farms as the border advanced against the setting sun. Others\\nwere to be Indian scouts, trappers, fur hunters, miners, cowboys, Texas\\nplanters, keepers of lonely posts on the plain and the desert, stage\\ndrivers, pilots of wagon trains, pony riders, fruit growers, \"lumber\\njacks,\" and smelter workers. One common bond united them--a passion for\\nthe self-government accorded to states. As soon as a few thousand\\nsettlers came together in a single territory, there arose a mighty shout\\nfor a position beside the staid commonwealths of the East and the South.\\nStatehood meant to the pioneers self-government, dignity, and the right\\nto dispose of land, minerals, and timber in their own way. In the quest\\nfor this local autonomy there arose many a wordy contest in Congress,\\neach of the political parties lending a helping hand in the admission of\\na state when it gave promise of adding new congressmen of the \"right\\npolitical persuasion,\" to use the current phrase.\\n\\n=Southern Planters and Texas.=--While the farmers of the North found the\\nbroad acres of the Western prairies stretching on before them apparently\\nin endless expanse, it was far different with the Southern planters.\\nEver active in their search for new fields as they exhausted the virgin\\nsoil of the older states, the restless subjects of King Cotton quickly\\nreached the frontier of Louisiana. There they paused; but only for a\\nmoment. The fertile land of Texas just across the boundary lured them on\\nand the Mexican republic to which it belonged extended to them a more\\nthan generous welcome. Little realizing the perils lurking in a\\n\"peaceful penetration,\" the authorities at Mexico City opened wide the\\ndoors and made large grants of land to American contractors, who agreed\\nto bring a number of families into Texas. The omnipresent Yankee, in the\\nperson of Moses Austin of Connecticut, hearing of this good news in the\\nSouthwest, obtained a grant in 1820 to settle three hundred Americans\\nnear Bexar--a commission finally carried out to the letter by his son\\nand celebrated in the name given to the present capital of the state of\\nTexas. Within a decade some twenty thousand Americans had crossed the\\nborder.\\n\\n=Mexico Closes the Door.=--The government of Mexico, unaccustomed to\\nsuch enterprise and thoroughly frightened by its extent, drew back in\\ndismay. Its fears were increased as quarrels broke out between the\\nAmericans and the natives in Texas. Fear grew into consternation when\\nefforts were made by President Jackson to buy the territory for the\\nUnited States. Mexico then sought to close the flood gates. It stopped\\nall American colonization schemes, canceled many of the land grants, put\\na tariff on farming implements, and abolished slavery. These barriers\\nwere raised too late. A call for help ran through the western border of\\nthe United States. The sentinels of the frontier answered. Davy\\nCrockett, the noted frontiersman, bear hunter, and backwoods politician;\\nJames Bowie, the dexterous wielder of the knife that to this day bears\\nhis name; and Sam Houston, warrior and pioneer, rushed to the aid of\\ntheir countrymen in Texas. Unacquainted with the niceties of diplomacy,\\nimpatient at the formalities of international law, they soon made it\\nknown that in spite of Mexican sovereignty they would be their own\\nmasters.\\n\\n=The Independence of Texas Declared.=--Numbering only about one-fourth\\nof the population in Texas, they raised the standard of revolt in 1836\\nand summoned a convention. Following in the footsteps of their\\nancestors, they issued a declaration of independence signed mainly by\\nAmericans from the slave states. Anticipating that the government of\\nMexico would not quietly accept their word of defiance as final, they\\ndispatched a force to repel \"the invading army,\" as General Houston\\ncalled the troops advancing under the command of Santa Ana, the Mexican\\npresident. A portion of the Texan soldiers took their stand in the\\nAlamo, an old Spanish mission in the cottonwood trees in the town of San\\nAntonio. Instead of obeying the order to blow up the mission and retire,\\nthey held their ground until they were completely surrounded and cut off\\nfrom all help. Refusing to surrender, they fought to the bitter end, the\\nlast man falling a victim to the sword. Vengeance was swift. Within\\nthree months General Houston overwhelmed Santa Ana at the San Jacinto,\\ntaking him prisoner of war and putting an end to all hopes for the\\nrestoration of Mexican sovereignty over Texas.\\n\\nThe Lone Star Republic, with Houston at the head, then sought admission\\nto the United States. This seemed at first an easy matter. All that was\\nrequired to bring it about appeared to be a treaty annexing Texas to the\\nunion. Moreover, President Jackson, at the height of his popularity, had\\na warm regard for General Houston and, with his usual sympathy for rough\\nand ready ways of doing things, approved the transaction. Through an\\nAmerican representative in Mexico, Jackson had long and anxiously\\nlabored, by means none too nice, to wring from the Mexican republic the\\ncession of the coveted territory. When the Texans took matters into\\ntheir own hands, he was more than pleased; but he could not marshal the\\napproval of two-thirds of the Senators required for a treaty of\\nannexation. Cautious as well as impetuous, Jackson did not press the\\nissue; he went out of office in 1837 with Texas uncertain as to her\\nfuture.\\n\\n=Northern Opposition to Annexation.=--All through the North the\\nopposition to annexation was clear and strong. Anti-slavery agitators\\ncould hardly find words savage enough to express their feelings.\\n\"Texas,\" exclaimed Channing in a letter to Clay, \"is but the first step\\nof aggression. I trust indeed that Providence will beat back and humble\\nour cupidity and ambition. I now ask whether as a people we are\\nprepared to seize on a neighboring territory for the end of extending\\nslavery? I ask whether as a people we can stand forth in the sight of\\nGod, in the sight of nations, and adopt this atrocious policy? Sooner\\nperish! Sooner be our name blotted out from the record of nations!\"\\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison called for the secession of the Northern states\\nif Texas was brought into the union with slavery. John Quincy Adams\\nwarned his countrymen that they were treading in the path of the\\nimperialism that had brought the nations of antiquity to judgment and\\ndestruction. Henry Clay, the Whig candidate for President, taking into\\naccount changing public sentiment, blew hot and cold, losing the state\\nof New York and the election of 1844 by giving a qualified approval of\\nannexation. In the same campaign, the Democrats boldly demanded the\\n\"Reannexation of Texas,\" based on claims which the United States once\\nhad to Spanish territory beyond the Sabine River.\\n\\n=Annexation.=--The politicians were disposed to walk very warily. Van\\nBuren, at heart opposed to slavery extension, refused to press the issue\\nof annexation. Tyler, a pro-slavery Democrat from Virginia, by a strange\\nfling of fortune carried into office as a nominal Whig, kept his mind\\nfirmly fixed on the idea of reelection and let the troublesome matter\\nrest until the end of his administration was in sight. He then listened\\nwith favor to the voice of the South. Calhoun stated what seemed to be a\\nconvincing argument: All good Americans have their hearts set on the\\nConstitution; the admission of Texas is absolutely essential to the\\npreservation of the union; it will give a balance of power to the South\\nas against the North growing with incredible swiftness in wealth and\\npopulation. Tyler, impressed by the plea, appointed Calhoun to the\\noffice of Secretary of State in 1844, authorizing him to negotiate the\\ntreaty of annexation--a commission at once executed. This scheme was\\nblocked in the Senate where the necessary two-thirds vote could not be\\nsecured. Balked but not defeated, the advocates of annexation drew up a\\njoint resolution which required only a majority vote in both houses,\\nand in February of the next year, just before Tyler gave way to Polk,\\nthey pushed it through Congress. So Texas, amid the groans of Boston and\\nthe hurrahs of Charleston, folded up her flag and came into the union.\\n\\n[Illustration: TEXAS AND THE TERRITORY IN DISPUTE]\\n\\n=The Mexican War.=--The inevitable war with Mexico, foretold by the\\nabolitionists and feared by Henry Clay, ensued, the ostensible cause\\nbeing a dispute over the boundaries of the new state. The Texans claimed\\nall the lands down to the Rio Grande. The Mexicans placed the border of\\nTexas at the Nueces River and a line drawn thence in a northerly\\ndirection. President Polk, accepting the Texan view of the controversy,\\nordered General Zachary Taylor to move beyond the Nueces in defense of\\nAmerican sovereignty. This act of power, deemed by the Mexicans an\\ninvasion of their territory, was followed by an attack on our troops.\\n\\nPresident Polk, not displeased with the turn of events, announced that\\nAmerican blood had been \"spilled on American soil\" and that war existed\\n\"by the act of Mexico.\" Congress, in a burst of patriotic fervor,\\nbrushed aside the protests of those who deplored the conduct of the\\ngovernment as wanton aggression on a weaker nation and granted money and\\nsupplies to prosecute the war. The few Whigs in the House of\\nRepresentatives, who refused to vote in favor of taking up arms,\\naccepted the inevitable with such good grace as they could command. All\\nthrough the South and the West the war was popular. New England\\ngrumbled, but gave loyal, if not enthusiastic, support to a conflict\\nprecipitated by policies not of its own choosing. Only a handful of firm\\nobjectors held out. James Russell Lowell, in his _Biglow Papers_, flung\\nscorn and sarcasm to the bitter end.\\n\\n=The Outcome of the War.=--The foregone conclusion was soon reached.\\nGeneral Taylor might have delivered the fatal thrust from northern\\nMexico if politics had not intervened. Polk, anxious to avoid raising up\\nanother military hero for the Whigs to nominate for President, decided\\nto divide the honors by sending General Scott to strike a blow at the\\ncapital, Mexico City. The deed was done with speed and pomp and two\\nheroes were lifted into presidential possibilities. In the Far West a\\nthird candidate was made, John C. Fremont, who, in cooperation with\\nCommodores Sloat and Stockton and General Kearney, planted the Stars and\\nStripes on the Pacific slope.\\n\\nIn February, 1848, the Mexicans came to terms, ceding to the victor\\nCalifornia, Arizona, New Mexico, and more--a domain greater in extent\\nthan the combined areas of France and Germany. As a salve to the wound,\\nthe vanquished received fifteen million dollars in cash and the\\ncancellation of many claims held by American citizens. Five years later,\\nthrough the negotiations of James Gadsden, a further cession of lands\\nalong the southern border of Arizona and New Mexico was secured on\\npayment of ten million dollars.\\n\\n=General Taylor Elected President.=--The ink was hardly dry upon the\\ntreaty that closed the war before \"rough and ready\" General Taylor, a\\nslave owner from Louisiana, \"a Whig,\" as he said, \"but not an ultra\\nWhig,\" was put forward as the Whig candidate for President. He himself\\nhad not voted for years and he was fairly innocent in matters political.\\nThe tariff, the currency, and internal improvements, with a magnificent\\ngesture he referred to the people\\'s representatives in Congress,\\noffering to enforce the laws as made, if elected. Clay\\'s followers\\nmourned. Polk stormed but could not win even a renomination at the hands\\nof the Democrats. So it came about that the hero of Buena Vista,\\ncelebrated for his laconic order, \"Give \\'em a little more grape, Captain\\nBragg,\" became President of the United States.\\n\\n\\nTHE PACIFIC COAST AND UTAH\\n\\n=Oregon.=--Closely associated in the popular mind with the contest about\\nthe affairs of Texas was a dispute with Great Britain over the\\npossession of territory in Oregon. In their presidential campaign of\\n1844, the Democrats had coupled with the slogan, \"The Reannexation of\\nTexas,\" two other cries, \"The Reoccupation of Oregon,\" and \"Fifty-four\\nForty or Fight.\" The last two slogans were founded on American\\ndiscoveries and explorations in the Far Northwest. Their appearance in\\npolitics showed that the distant Oregon country, larger in area than New\\nEngland, New York, and Pennsylvania combined, was at last receiving from\\nthe nation the attention which its importance warranted.\\n\\n_Joint Occupation and Settlement._--Both England and the United States\\nhad long laid claim to Oregon and in 1818 they had agreed to occupy the\\nterritory jointly--a contract which was renewed ten years later for an\\nindefinite period. Under this plan, citizens of both countries were free\\nto hunt and settle anywhere in the region. The vanguard of British fur\\ntraders and Canadian priests was enlarged by many new recruits, with\\nAmericans not far behind them. John Jacob Astor, the resourceful New\\nYork merchant, sent out trappers and hunters who established a trading\\npost at Astoria in 1811. Some twenty years later, American\\nmissionaries--among them two very remarkable men, Jason Lee and Marcus\\nWhitman--were preaching the gospel to the Indians.\\n\\nThrough news from the fur traders and missionaries, Eastern farmers\\nheard of the fertile lands awaiting their plows on the Pacific slope;\\nthose with the pioneering spirit made ready to take possession of the\\nnew country. In 1839 a band went around by Cape Horn. Four years later a\\ngreat expedition went overland. The way once broken, others followed\\nrapidly. As soon as a few settlements were well established, the\\npioneers held a mass meeting and agreed upon a plan of government. \"We,\\nthe people of Oregon territory,\" runs the preamble to their compact,\\n\"for the purposes of mutual protection and to secure peace and\\nprosperity among ourselves, agree to adopt the following laws and\\nregulations until such time as the United States of America extend their\\njurisdiction over us.\" Thus self-government made its way across the\\nRocky Mountains.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE OREGON COUNTRY AND THE DISPUTED BOUNDARY]\\n\\n_The Boundary Dispute with England Adjusted._--By this time it was\\nevident that the boundaries of Oregon must be fixed. Having made the\\nquestion an issue in his campaign, Polk, after his election in 1844,\\npressed it upon the attention of the country. In his inaugural address\\nand his first message to Congress he reiterated the claim of the\\nDemocratic platform that \"our title to the whole territory of Oregon is\\nclear and unquestionable.\" This pretension Great Britain firmly\\nrejected, leaving the President a choice between war and compromise.\\n\\nPolk, already having the contest with Mexico on his hands, sought and\\nobtained a compromise. The British government, moved by a hint from the\\nAmerican minister, offered a settlement which would fix the boundary at\\nthe forty-ninth parallel instead of \"fifty-four forty,\" and give it\\nVancouver Island. Polk speedily chose this way out of the dilemma.\\nInstead of making the decision himself, however, and drawing up a\\ntreaty, he turned to the Senate for \"counsel.\" As prearranged with party\\nleaders, the advice was favorable to the plan. The treaty, duly drawn in\\n1846, was ratified by the Senate after an acrimonious debate. \"Oh!\\nmountain that was delivered of a mouse,\" exclaimed Senator Benton, \"thy\\nname shall be fifty-four forty!\" Thirteen years later, the southern part\\nof the territory was admitted to the union as the state of Oregon,\\nleaving the northern and eastern sections in the status of a territory.\\n\\n=California.=--With the growth of the northwestern empire, dedicated by\\nnature to freedom, the planting interests might have been content, had\\nfortune not wrested from them the fair country of California. Upon this\\nhuge territory they had set their hearts. The mild climate and fertile\\nsoil seemed well suited to slavery and the planters expected to extend\\ntheir sway to the entire domain. California was a state of more than\\n155,000 square miles--about seventy times the size of the state of\\nDelaware. It could readily be divided into five or six large states, if\\nthat became necessary to preserve the Southern balance of power.\\n\\n_Early American Relations with California._--Time and tide, it seems,\\nwere not on the side of the planters. Already Americans of a far\\ndifferent type were invading the Pacific slope. Long before Polk ever\\ndreamed of California, the Yankee with his cargo of notions had been\\naround the Horn. Daring skippers had sailed out of New England harbors\\nwith a variety of goods, bent their course around South America to\\nCalifornia, on to China and around the world, trading as they went and\\nleaving pots, pans, woolen cloth, guns, boots, shoes, salt fish, naval\\nstores, and rum in their wake. \"Home from Californy!\" rang the cry in\\nmany a New England port as a good captain let go his anchor on his\\nreturn from the long trading voyage in the Pacific.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE OVERLAND TRAILS]\\n\\n_The Overland Trails._--Not to be outdone by the mariners of the deep,\\nwestern scouts searched for overland routes to the Pacific. Zebulon\\nPike, explorer and pathfinder, by his expedition into the Southwest\\nduring Jefferson\\'s administration, had discovered the resources of New\\nSpain and had shown his countrymen how easy it was to reach Santa Fe\\nfrom the upper waters of the Arkansas River. Not long afterward, traders\\nlaid open the route, making Franklin, Missouri, and later Fort\\nLeavenworth the starting point. Along the trail, once surveyed, poured\\ncaravans heavily guarded by armed men against marauding Indians. Sand\\nstorms often wiped out all signs of the route; hunger and thirst did\\nmany a band of wagoners to death; but the lure of the game and the\\nprofits at the end kept the business thriving. Huge stocks of cottons,\\nglass, hardware, and ammunition were drawn almost across the continent\\nto be exchanged at Santa Fe for furs, Indian blankets, silver, and\\nmules; and many a fortune was made out of the traffic.\\n\\n_Americans in California._--Why stop at Santa Fe? The question did not\\nlong remain unanswered. In 1829, Ewing Young broke the path to Los\\nAngeles. Thirteen years later Fremont made the first of his celebrated\\nexpeditions across plain, desert, and mountain, arousing the interest of\\nthe entire country in the Far West. In the wake of the pathfinders went\\nadventurers, settlers, and artisans. By 1847, more than one-fifth of the\\ninhabitants in the little post of two thousand on San Francisco Bay were\\nfrom the United States. The Mexican War, therefore, was not the\\nbeginning but the end of the American conquest of California--a conquest\\ninitiated by Americans who went to till the soil, to trade, or to follow\\nsome mechanical pursuit.\\n\\n_The Discovery of Gold._--As if to clinch the hold on California already\\nsecured by the friends of free soil, there came in 1848 the sudden\\ndiscovery of gold at Sutter\\'s Mill in the Sacramento Valley. When this\\nexciting news reached the East, a mighty rush began to California, over\\nthe trails, across the Isthmus of Panama, and around Cape Horn. Before\\ntwo years had passed, it is estimated that a hundred thousand people, in\\nsearch of fortunes, had arrived in California--mechanics, teachers,\\ndoctors, lawyers, farmers, miners, and laborers from the four corners of\\nthe earth.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO IN 1849]\\n\\n_California a Free State._--With this increase in population there\\nnaturally resulted the usual demand for admission to the union. Instead\\nof waiting for authority from Washington, the Californians held a\\nconvention in 1849 and framed their constitution. With impatience, the\\ndelegates brushed aside the plea that \"the balance of power between the\\nNorth and South\" required the admission of their state as a slave\\ncommonwealth. Without a dissenting voice, they voted in favor of freedom\\nand boldly made their request for inclusion among the United States.\\nPresident Taylor, though a Southern man, advised Congress to admit the\\napplicant. Robert Toombs of Georgia vowed to God that he preferred\\nsecession. Henry Clay, the great compromiser, came to the rescue and in\\n1850 California was admitted as a free state.\\n\\n=Utah.=--On the long road to California, in the midst of forbidding and\\nbarren wastes, a religious sect, the Mormons, had planted a colony\\ndestined to a stormy career. Founded in 1830 under the leadership of\\nJoseph Smith of New York, the sect had suffered from many cruel buffets\\nof fortune. From Ohio they had migrated into Missouri where they were\\nset upon and beaten. Some of them were murdered by indignant neighbors.\\nHarried out of Missouri, they went into Illinois only to see their\\ndirector and prophet, Smith, first imprisoned by the authorities and\\nthen shot by a mob. Having raised up a cloud of enemies on account of\\nboth their religious faith and their practice of allowing a man to have\\nmore than one wife, they fell in heartily with the suggestion of a new\\nleader, Brigham Young, that they go into the Far West beyond the plains\\nof Kansas--into the forlorn desert where the wicked would cease from\\ntroubling and the weary could be at rest, as they read in the Bible. In\\n1847, Young, with a company of picked men, searched far and wide until\\nhe found a suitable spot overlooking the Salt Lake Valley. Returning to\\nIllinois, he gathered up his followers, now numbering several thousand,\\nand in one mighty wagon caravan they all went to their distant haven.\\n\\n_Brigham Young and His Economic System._--In Brigham Young the Mormons\\nhad a leader of remarkable power who gave direction to the redemption of\\nthe arid soil, the management of property, and the upbuilding of\\nindustry. He promised them to make the desert blossom as the rose, and\\nverily he did it. He firmly shaped the enterprise of the colony along\\nco-operative lines, holding down the speculator and profiteer with one\\nhand and giving encouragement to the industrious poor with the other.\\nWith the shrewdness befitting a good business man, he knew how to draw\\nthe line between public and private interest. Land was given outright to\\neach family, but great care was exercised in the distribution so that\\nnone should have great advantage over another. The purchase of supplies\\nand the sale of produce were carried on through a cooperative store, the\\nprofits of which went to the common good. Encountering for the first\\ntime in the history of the Anglo-Saxon race the problem of aridity, the\\nMormons surmounted the most perplexing obstacles with astounding skill.\\nThey built irrigation works by cooperative labor and granted water\\nrights to all families on equitable terms.\\n\\n_The Growth of Industries._--Though farming long remained the major\\ninterest of the colony, the Mormons, eager to be self-supporting in\\nevery possible way, bent their efforts also to manufacturing and later\\nto mining. Their missionaries, who hunted in the highways and byways of\\nEurope for converts, never failed to stress the economic advantages of\\nthe sect. \"We want,\" proclaimed President Young to all the earth, \"a\\ncompany of woolen manufacturers to come with machinery and take the wool\\nfrom the sheep and convert it into the best clothes. We want a company\\nof potters; we need them; the clay is ready and the dishes wanted.... We\\nwant some men to start a furnace forthwith; the iron, coal, and molders\\nare waiting.... We have a printing press and any one who can take good\\nprinting and writing paper to the Valley will be a blessing to\\nthemselves and the church.\" Roads and bridges were built; millions were\\nspent in experiments in agriculture and manufacturing; missionaries at a\\nhuge cost were maintained in the East and in Europe; an army was kept\\nfor defense against the Indians; and colonies were planted in the\\noutlying regions. A historian of Deseret, as the colony was called by\\nthe Mormons, estimated in 1895 that by the labor of their hands the\\npeople had produced nearly half a billion dollars in wealth since the\\ncoming of the vanguard.\\n\\n_Polygamy Forbidden._--The hope of the Mormons that they might forever\\nremain undisturbed by outsiders was soon dashed to earth, for hundreds\\nof farmers and artisans belonging to other religious sects came to\\nsettle among them. In 1850 the colony was so populous and prosperous\\nthat it was organized into a territory of the United States and brought\\nunder the supervision of the federal government. Protests against\\npolygamy were raised in the colony and at the seat of authority three\\nthousand miles away at Washington. The new Republican party in 1856\\nproclaimed it \"the right and duty of Congress to prohibit in the\\nTerritories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery.\" In\\ndue time the Mormons had to give up their marriage practices which were\\ncondemned by the common opinion of all western civilization; but they\\nkept their religious faith. Monuments to their early enterprise are seen\\nin the Temple and the Tabernacle, the irrigation works, and the great\\nwealth of the Church.\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY OF WESTERN DEVELOPMENT AND NATIONAL POLITICS\\n\\nWhile the statesmen of the old generation were solving the problems of\\ntheir age, hunters, pioneers, and home seekers were preparing new\\nproblems beyond the Alleghanies. The West was rising in population and\\nwealth. Between 1783 and 1829, eleven states were added to the original\\nthirteen. All but two were in the West. Two of them were in the\\nLouisiana territory beyond the Mississippi. Here the process of\\ncolonization was repeated. Hardy frontier people cut down the forests,\\nbuilt log cabins, laid out farms, and cut roads through the wilderness.\\nThey began a new civilization just as the immigrants to Virginia or\\nMassachusetts had done two centuries earlier.\\n\\nLike the seaboard colonists before them, they too cherished the spirit\\nof independence and power. They had not gone far upon their course\\nbefore they resented the monopoly of the presidency by the East. In 1829\\nthey actually sent one of their own cherished leaders, Andrew Jackson,\\nto the White House. Again in 1840, in 1844, in 1848, and in 1860, the\\nMississippi Valley could boast that one of its sons had been chosen for\\nthe seat of power at Washington. Its democratic temper evoked a cordial\\nresponse in the towns of the East where the old aristocracy had been put\\naside and artisans had been given the ballot.\\n\\nFor three decades the West occupied the interest of the nation. Under\\nJackson\\'s leadership, it destroyed the second United States Bank. When\\nhe smote nullification in South Carolina, it gave him cordial support.\\nIt approved his policy of parceling out government offices among party\\nworkers--\"the spoils system\" in all its fullness. On only one point did\\nit really dissent. The West heartily favored internal improvements, the\\nappropriation of federal funds for highways, canals, and railways.\\nJackson had misgivings on this question and awakened sharp criticism by\\nvetoing a road improvement bill.\\n\\nFrom their point of vantage on the frontier, the pioneers pressed on\\nwestward. They pushed into Texas, created a state, declared their\\nindependence, demanded a place in the union, and precipitated a war with\\nMexico. They crossed the trackless plain and desert, laying out trails\\nto Santa Fe, to Oregon, and to California. They were upon the scene when\\nthe Mexican War brought California under the Stars and Stripes. They had\\nlaid out their farms in the Willamette Valley when the slogan\\n\"Fifty-Four Forty or Fight\" forced a settlement of the Oregon boundary.\\nCalifornia and Oregon were already in the union when there arose the\\nGreat Civil War testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived\\nand so dedicated could long endure.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nG.P.

SECTIONAL CONFLICT AND RECONSTRUCTION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nTHE RISE OF THE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM\\n\\n\\nIf Jefferson could have lived to see the Stars and Stripes planted on\\nthe Pacific Coast, the broad empire of Texas added to the planting\\nstates, and the valley of the Willamette waving with wheat sown by\\nfarmers from New England, he would have been more than fortified in his\\nfaith that the future of America lay in agriculture. Even a stanch old\\nFederalist like Gouverneur Morris or Josiah Quincy would have mournfully\\nconceded both the prophecy and the claim. Manifest destiny never seemed\\nmore clearly written in the stars.\\n\\nAs the farmers from the Northwest and planters from the Southwest poured\\nin upon the floor of Congress, the party of Jefferson, christened anew\\nby Jackson, grew stronger year by year. Opponents there were, no doubt,\\ndisgruntled critics and Whigs by conviction; but in 1852 Franklin\\nPierce, the Democratic candidate for President, carried every state in\\nthe union except Massachusetts, Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee. This\\nvictory, a triumph under ordinary circumstances, was all the more\\nsignificant in that Pierce was pitted against a hero of the Mexican War,\\nGeneral Scott, whom the Whigs, hoping to win by rousing the martial\\nardor of the voters, had nominated. On looking at the election returns,\\nthe new President calmly assured the planters that \"the general\\nprinciple of reduction of duties with a view to revenue may now be\\nregarded as the settled policy of the country.\" With equal confidence,\\nhe waved aside those agitators who devoted themselves \"to the supposed\\ninterests of the relatively few Africans in the United States.\" Like a\\nwatchman in the night he called to the country: \"All\\'s well.\"\\n\\nThe party of Hamilton and Clay lay in the dust.\\n\\n\\nTHE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\\n\\nAs pride often goeth before a fall, so sanguine expectation is sometimes\\nthe symbol of defeat. Jackson destroyed the bank. Polk signed the tariff\\nbill of 1846 striking an effective blow at the principle of protection\\nfor manufactures. Pierce promised to silence the abolitionists. His\\nsuccessor was to approve a drastic step in the direction of free trade.\\nNevertheless all these things left untouched the springs of power that\\nwere in due time to make America the greatest industrial nation on the\\nearth; namely, vast national resources, business enterprise, inventive\\ngenius, and the free labor supply of Europe. Unseen by the thoughtless,\\nunrecorded in the diaries of wiseacres, rarely mentioned in the speeches\\nof statesmen, there was swiftly rising such a tide in the affairs of\\nAmerica as Jefferson and Hamilton never dreamed of in their little\\nphilosophies.\\n\\n=The Inventors.=--Watt and Boulton experimenting with steam in England,\\nWhitney combining wood and steel into a cotton gin, Fulton and Fitch\\napplying the steam engine to navigation, Stevens and Peter Cooper trying\\nout the \"iron horse\" on \"iron highways,\" Slater building spinning mills\\nin Pawtucket, Howe attaching the needle to the flying wheel, Morse\\nspanning a continent with the telegraph, Cyrus Field linking the markets\\nof the new world with the old along the bed of the Atlantic, McCormick\\nbreaking the sickle under the reaper--these men and a thousand more were\\ndestroying in a mighty revolution of industry the world of the\\nstagecoach and the tallow candle which Washington and Franklin had\\ninherited little changed from the age of Caesar. Whitney was to make\\ncotton king. Watt and Fulton were to make steel and steam masters of the\\nworld. Agriculture was to fall behind in the race for supremacy.\\n\\n=Industry Outstrips Planting.=--The story of invention, that tribute to\\nthe triumph of mind over matter, fascinating as a romance, need not be\\ntreated in detail here. The effects of invention on social and political\\nlife, multitudinous and never-ending, form the very warp and woof of\\nAmerican progress from the days of Andrew Jackson to the latest hour.\\nNeither the great civil conflict--the clash of two systems--nor the\\nproblems of the modern age can be approached without an understanding of\\nthe striking phases of industrialism.\\n\\n[Illustration: A NEW ENGLAND MILL BUILT IN 1793]\\n\\nFirst and foremost among them was the uprush of mills managed by\\ncaptains of industry and manned by labor drawn from farms, cities, and\\nforeign lands. For every planter who cleared a domain in the Southwest\\nand gathered his army of bondmen about him, there rose in the North a\\nmagician of steam and steel who collected under his roof an army of free\\nworkers.\\n\\nIn seven league boots this new giant strode ahead of the Southern giant.\\nBetween 1850 and 1859, to use dollars and cents as the measure of\\nprogress, the value of domestic manufactures including mines and\\nfisheries rose from $1,019,106,616 to $1,900,000,000, an increase of\\neighty-six per cent in ten years. In this same period the total\\nproduction of naval stores, rice, sugar, tobacco, and cotton, the\\nstaples of the South, went only from $165,000,000, in round figures, to\\n$204,000,000. At the halfway point of the century, the capital invested\\nin industry, commerce, and cities far exceeded the value of all the farm\\nland between the Atlantic and the Pacific; thus the course of economy\\nhad been reversed in fifty years. Tested by figures of production, King\\nCotton had shriveled by 1860 to a petty prince in comparison, for each\\nyear the captains of industry turned out goods worth nearly twenty times\\nall the bales of cotton picked on Southern plantations. Iron, boots and\\nshoes, and leather goods pouring from Northern mills surpassed in value\\nthe entire cotton output.\\n\\n=The Agrarian West Turns to Industry.=--Nor was this vast enterprise\\nconfined to the old Northeast where, as Madison had sagely remarked,\\ncommerce was early dominant. \"Cincinnati,\" runs an official report in\\n1854, \"appears to be a great central depot for ready-made clothing and\\nits manufacture for the Western markets may be said to be one of the\\ngreat trades of that city.\" There, wrote another traveler, \"I heard the\\ncrack of the cattle driver\\'s whip and the hum of the factory: the West\\nand the East meeting.\" Louisville and St. Louis were already famous for\\ntheir clothing trades and the manufacture of cotton bagging. Five\\nhundred of the two thousand woolen mills in the country in 1860 were in\\nthe Western states. Of the output of flour and grist mills, which almost\\nreached in value the cotton crop of 1850, the Ohio Valley furnished a\\nrapidly growing share. The old home of Jacksonian democracy, where\\nFederalists had been almost as scarce as monarchists, turned slowly\\nbackward, as the needle to the pole, toward the principle of protection\\nfor domestic industry, espoused by Hamilton and defended by Clay.\\n\\n=The Extension of Canals and Railways.=--As necessary to mechanical\\nindustry as steel and steam power was the great market, spread over a\\nwide and diversified area and knit together by efficient means of\\ntransportation. This service was supplied to industry by the steamship,\\nwhich began its career on the Hudson in 1807; by the canals, of which\\nthe Erie opened in 1825 was the most noteworthy; and by the railways,\\nwhich came into practical operation about 1830.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n\\nAN EARLY RAILWAY]\\n\\nWith sure instinct the Eastern manufacturer reached out for the markets\\nof the Northwest territory where free farmers were producing annually\\nstaggering crops of corn, wheat, bacon, and wool. The two great canal\\nsystems--the Erie connecting New York City with the waterways of the\\nGreat Lakes and the Pennsylvania chain linking Philadelphia with the\\nheadwaters of the Ohio--gradually turned the tide of trade from New\\nOrleans to the Eastern seaboard. The railways followed the same paths.\\nBy 1860, New York had rail connections with Chicago and St. Louis, one\\nof the routes running through the Hudson and Mohawk valleys and along\\nthe Great Lakes, the other through Philadelphia and Pennsylvania and\\nacross the rich wheat fields of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Baltimore,\\nnot to be outdone by her two rivals, reached out over the mountains for\\nthe Western trade and in 1857 had trains running into St. Louis.\\n\\nIn railway enterprise the South took more interest than in canals, and\\nthe friends of that section came to its aid. To offset the magnet\\ndrawing trade away from the Mississippi Valley, lines were built from\\nthe Gulf to Chicago, the Illinois Central part of the project being a\\nmonument to the zeal and industry of a Democrat, better known in\\npolitics than in business, Stephen A. Douglas. The swift movement of\\ncotton and tobacco to the North or to seaports was of common concern to\\nplanters and manufacturers. Accordingly lines were flung down along the\\nSouthern coast, linking Richmond, Charleston, and Savannah with the\\nNorthern markets. Other lines struck inland from the coast, giving a\\nrail outlet to the sea for Raleigh, Columbia, Atlanta, Chattanooga,\\nNashville, and Montgomery. Nevertheless, in spite of this enterprise,\\nthe mileage of all the Southern states in 1860 did not equal that of\\nOhio, Indiana, and Illinois combined.\\n\\n=Banking and Finance.=--Out of commerce and manufactures and the\\nconstruction and operation of railways came such an accumulation of\\ncapital in the Northern states as merchants of old never imagined. The\\nbanks of the four industrial states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New\\nYork, and Pennsylvania in 1860 had funds greater than the banks in all\\nthe other states combined. New York City had become the money market of\\nAmerica, the center to which industrial companies, railway promoters,\\nfarmers, and planters turned for capital to initiate and carry on their\\noperations. The banks of Louisiana, South Carolina, Georgia, and\\nVirginia, it is true, had capital far in excess of the banks of the\\nNorthwest; but still they were relatively small compared with the\\nfinancial institutions of the East.\\n\\n=The Growth of the Industrial Population.=--A revolution of such\\nmagnitude in industry, transport, and finance, overturning as it did the\\nagrarian civilization of the old Northwest and reaching out to the very\\nborders of the country, could not fail to bring in its train\\nconsequences of a striking character. Some were immediate and obvious.\\nOthers require a fullness of time not yet reached to reveal their\\ncomplete significance. Outstanding among them was the growth of an\\nindustrial population, detached from the land, concentrated in cities,\\nand, to use Jefferson\\'s phrase, dependent upon \"the caprices and\\ncasualties of trade\" for a livelihood. This was a result, as the great\\nVirginian had foreseen, which flowed inevitably from public and private\\nefforts to stimulate industry as against agriculture.\\n\\n[Illustration: LOWELL, MASSACHUSETTS, IN 1838, AN EARLY INDUSTRIAL\\nTOWN]\\n\\nIt was estimated in 1860, on the basis of the census figures, that\\nmechanical production gave employment to 1,100,000 men and 285,000\\nwomen, making, if the average number of dependents upon them be\\nreckoned, nearly six million people or about one-sixth of the population\\nof the country sustained from manufactures. \"This,\" runs the official\\nrecord, \"was exclusive of the number engaged in the production of many\\nof the raw materials and of the food for manufacturers; in the\\ndistribution of their products, such as merchants, clerks, draymen,\\nmariners, the employees of railroads, expresses, and steamboats; of\\ncapitalists, various artistic and professional classes, as well as\\ncarpenters, bricklayers, painters, and the members of other mechanical\\ntrades not classed as manufactures. It is safe to assume, then, that\\none-third of the whole population is supported, directly, or indirectly,\\nby manufacturing industry.\" Taking, however, the number of persons\\ndirectly supported by manufactures, namely about six millions, reveals\\nthe astounding fact that the white laboring population, divorced from\\nthe soil, already exceeded the number of slaves on Southern farms and\\nplantations.\\n\\n_Immigration._--The more carefully the rapid growth of the industrial\\npopulation is examined, the more surprising is the fact that such an\\nimmense body of free laborers could be found, particularly when it is\\nrecalled to what desperate straits the colonial leaders were put in\\nsecuring immigrants,--slavery, indentured servitude, and kidnapping\\nbeing the fruits of their necessities. The answer to the enigma is to be\\nfound partly in European conditions and partly in the cheapness of\\ntransportation after the opening of the era of steam navigation. Shrewd\\nobservers of the course of events had long foreseen that a flood of\\ncheap labor was bound to come when the way was made easy. Some, among\\nthem Chief Justice Ellsworth, went so far as to prophesy that white\\nlabor would in time be so abundant that slavery would disappear as the\\nmore costly of the two labor systems. The processes of nature were aided\\nby the policies of government in England and Germany.\\n\\n_The Coming of the Irish._--The opposition of the Irish people to the\\nEnglish government, ever furious and irrepressible, was increased in the\\nmid forties by an almost total failure of the potato crop, the main\\nsupport of the peasants. Catholic in religion, they had been compelled\\nto support a Protestant church. Tillers of the soil by necessity, they\\nwere forced to pay enormous tributes to absentee landlords in England\\nwhose claim to their estates rested upon the title of conquest and\\nconfiscation. Intensely loyal to their race, the Irish were subjected in\\nall things to the Parliament at London, in which their small minority of\\nrepresentatives had little influence save in holding a balance of power\\nbetween the two contending English parties. To the constant political\\nirritation, the potato famine added physical distress beyond\\ndescription. In cottages and fields and along the highways the victims\\nof starvation lay dead by the hundreds, the relief which charity\\nafforded only bringing misery more sharply to the foreground. Those who\\nwere fortunate enough to secure passage money sought escape to America.\\nIn 1844 the total immigration into the United States was less than\\neighty thousand; in 1850 it had risen by leaps and bounds to more than\\nthree hundred thousand. Between 1820 and 1860 the immigrants from the\\nUnited Kingdom numbered 2,750,000, of whom more than one-half were\\nIrish. It has been said with a touch of exaggeration that the American\\ncanals and railways of those days were built by the labor of Irishmen.\\n\\n_The German Migration._--To political discontent and economic distress,\\nsuch as was responsible for the coming of the Irish, may likewise be\\ntraced the source of the Germanic migration. The potato blight that fell\\nupon Ireland visited the Rhine Valley and Southern Germany at the same\\ntime with results as pitiful, if less extensive. The calamity inflicted\\nby nature was followed shortly by another inflicted by the despotic\\nconduct of German kings and princes. In 1848 there had occurred\\nthroughout Europe a popular uprising in behalf of republics and\\ndemocratic government. For a time it rode on a full tide of success.\\nKings were overthrown, or compelled to promise constitutional\\ngovernment, and tyrannical ministers fled from their palaces. Then came\\nreaction. Those who had championed the popular cause were imprisoned,\\nshot, or driven out of the land. Men of attainments and distinction,\\nwhose sole offense was opposition to the government of kings and\\nprinces, sought an asylum in America, carrying with them to the land of\\ntheir adoption the spirit of liberty and democracy. In 1847 over fifty\\nthousand Germans came to America, the forerunners of a migration that\\nincreased, almost steadily, for many years. The record of 1860 showed\\nthat in the previous twenty years nearly a million and a half had found\\nhomes in the United States. Far and wide they scattered, from the mills\\nand shops of the seacoast towns to the uttermost frontiers of Wisconsin\\nand Minnesota.\\n\\n_The Labor of Women and Children._--If the industries, canals, and\\nrailways of the country were largely manned by foreign labor, still\\nimportant native sources must not be overlooked; above all, the women\\nand children of the New England textile districts. Spinning and weaving,\\nby a tradition that runs far beyond the written records of mankind,\\nbelonged to women. Indeed it was the dexterous housewives, spinsters,\\nand boys and girls that laid the foundations of the textile industry in\\nAmerica, foundations upon which the mechanical revolution was built. As\\nthe wheel and loom were taken out of the homes to the factories operated\\nby water power or the steam engine, the women and, to use Hamilton\\'s\\nphrase, \"the children of tender years,\" followed as a matter of course.\\n\"The cotton manufacture alone employs six thousand persons in Lowell,\"\\nwrote a French observer in 1836; \"of this number nearly five thousand\\nare young women from seventeen to twenty-four years of age, the\\ndaughters of farmers from the different New England states.\" It was not\\nuntil after the middle of the century that foreign lands proved to be\\nthe chief source from which workers were recruited for the factories of\\nNew England. It was then that the daughters of the Puritans, outdone by\\nthe competition of foreign labor, both of men and women, left the\\nspinning jenny and the loom to other hands.\\n\\n=The Rise of Organized Labor.=--The changing conditions of American\\nlife, marked by the spreading mill towns of New England, New York, and\\nPennsylvania and the growth of cities like Buffalo, Cincinnati,\\nLouisville, St. Louis, Detroit, and Chicago in the West, naturally\\nbrought changes, as Jefferson had prophesied, in \"manners and morals.\" A\\nfew mechanics, smiths, carpenters, and masons, widely scattered through\\nfarming regions and rural villages, raise no such problems as tens of\\nthousands of workers collected in one center in daily intercourse,\\nlearning the power of cooperation and union.\\n\\nEven before the coming of steam and machinery, in the \"good old days\" of\\nhandicrafts, laborers in many trades--printers, shoemakers, carpenters,\\nfor example--had begun to draw together in the towns for the advancement\\nof their interests in the form of higher wages, shorter days, and\\nmilder laws. The shoemakers of Philadelphia, organized in 1794,\\nconducted a strike in 1799 and held together until indicted seven years\\nlater for conspiracy. During the twenties and thirties, local labor\\nunions sprang up in all industrial centers and they led almost\\nimmediately to city federations of the several crafts.\\n\\nAs the thousands who were dependent upon their daily labor for their\\nlivelihood mounted into the millions and industries spread across the\\ncontinent, the local unions of craftsmen grew into national craft\\norganizations bound together by the newspapers, the telegraph, and the\\nrailways. Before 1860 there were several such national trade unions,\\nincluding the plumbers, printers, mule spinners, iron molders, and stone\\ncutters. All over the North labor leaders arose--men unknown to general\\nhistory but forceful and resourceful characters who forged links binding\\nscattered and individual workers into a common brotherhood. An attempt\\nwas even made in 1834 to federate all the crafts into a permanent\\nnational organization; but it perished within three years through lack\\nof support. Half a century had to elapse before the American Federation\\nof Labor was to accomplish this task.\\n\\nAll the manifestations of the modern labor movement had appeared, in\\ngerm at least, by the time the mid-century was reached: unions, labor\\nleaders, strikes, a labor press, a labor political program, and a labor\\npolitical party. In every great city industrial disputes were a common\\noccurrence. The papers recorded about four hundred in two years,\\n1853-54, local affairs but forecasting economic struggles in a larger\\nfield. The labor press seems to have begun with the founding of the\\n_Mechanics\\' Free Press_ in Philadelphia in 1828 and the establishment of\\nthe New York _Workingman\\'s Advocate_ shortly afterward. These\\nsemi-political papers were in later years followed by regular trade\\npapers designed to weld together and advance the interests of particular\\ncrafts. Edited by able leaders, these little sheets with limited\\ncirculation wielded an enormous influence in the ranks of the workers.\\n\\n=Labor and Politics.=--As for the political program of labor, the main\\nplanks were clear and specific: the abolition of imprisonment for debt,\\nmanhood suffrage in states where property qualifications still\\nprevailed, free and universal education, laws protecting the safety and\\nhealth of workers in mills and factories, abolition of lotteries, repeal\\nof laws requiring militia service, and free land in the West.\\n\\nInto the labor papers and platforms there sometimes crept a note of\\nhostility to the masters of industry, a sign of bitterness that excited\\nlittle alarm while cheap land in the West was open to the discontented.\\nThe Philadelphia workmen, in issuing a call for a local convention,\\ninvited \"all those of our fellow citizens who live by their own labor\\nand none other.\" In Newcastle county, Delaware, the association of\\nworking people complained in 1830: \"The poor have no laws; the laws are\\nmade by the rich and of course for the rich.\" Here and there an\\nextremist went to the length of advocating an equal division of wealth\\namong all the people--the crudest kind of communism.\\n\\nAgitation of this character produced in labor circles profound distrust\\nof both Whigs and Democrats who talked principally about tariffs and\\nbanks; it resulted in attempts to found independent labor parties. In\\nPhiladelphia, Albany, New York City, and New England, labor candidates\\nwere put up for elections in the early thirties and in a few cases were\\nvictorious at the polls. \"The balance of power has at length got into\\nthe hands of the working people, where it properly belongs,\"\\ntriumphantly exclaimed the _Mechanics\\' Free Press_ of Philadelphia in\\n1829. But the triumph was illusory. Dissensions appeared in the labor\\nranks. The old party leaders, particularly of Tammany Hall, the\\nDemocratic party organization in New York City, offered concessions to\\nlabor in return for votes. Newspapers unsparingly denounced \"trade union\\npoliticians\" as \"demagogues,\" \"levellers,\" and \"rag, tag, and bobtail\";\\nand some of them, deeming labor unrest the sour fruit of manhood\\nsuffrage, suggested disfranchisement as a remedy. Under the influence\\nof concessions and attacks the political fever quickly died away, and\\nthe end of the decade left no remnant of the labor political parties.\\nLabor leaders turned to a task which seemed more substantial and\\npractical, that of organizing workingmen into craft unions for the\\ndefinite purpose of raising wages and reducing hours.\\n\\n\\nTHE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND NATIONAL POLITICS\\n\\n=Southern Plans for Union with the West.=--It was long the design of\\nSouthern statesmen like Calhoun to hold the West and the South together\\nin one political party. The theory on which they based their hope was\\nsimple. Both sections were agricultural--the producers of raw materials\\nand the buyers of manufactured goods. The planters were heavy purchasers\\nof Western bacon, pork, mules, and grain. The Mississippi River and its\\ntributaries formed the natural channel for the transportation of heavy\\nproduce southward to the plantations and outward to Europe. Therefore,\\nran their political reasoning, the interests of the two sections were\\none. By standing together in favor of low tariffs, they could buy their\\nmanufactures cheaply in Europe and pay for them in cotton, tobacco, and\\ngrain. The union of the two sections under Jackson\\'s management seemed\\nperfect.\\n\\n=The East Forms Ties with the West.=--Eastern leaders were not blind to\\nthe ambitions of Southern statesmen. On the contrary, they also\\nrecognized the importance of forming strong ties with the agrarian West\\nand drawing the produce of the Ohio Valley to Philadelphia and New York.\\nThe canals and railways were the physical signs of this economic union,\\nand the results, commercial and political, were soon evident. By the\\nmiddle of the century, Southern economists noted the change, one of\\nthem, De Bow, lamenting that \"the great cities of the North have\\nseverally penetrated the interior with artificial lines until they have\\ntaken from the open and untaxed current of the Mississippi the commerce\\nproduced on its borders.\" To this writer it was an astounding thing to\\nbehold \"the number of steamers that now descend the upper Mississippi\\nRiver, loaded to the guards with produce, as far as the mouth of the\\nIllinois River and then turn up that stream with their cargoes to be\\nshipped to New York _via_ Chicago. The Illinois canal has not only swept\\nthe whole produce along the line of the Illinois River to the East, but\\nit is drawing the products of the upper Mississippi through the same\\nchannel; thus depriving New Orleans and St. Louis of a rich portion of\\ntheir former trade.\"\\n\\nIf to any shippers the broad current of the great river sweeping down to\\nNew Orleans offered easier means of physical communication to the sea\\nthan the canals and railways, the difference could be overcome by the\\ncredit which Eastern bankers were able to extend to the grain and\\nproduce buyers, in the first instance, and through them to the farmers\\non the soil. The acute Southern observer just quoted, De Bow, admitted\\nwith evident regret, in 1852, that \"last autumn, the rich regions of\\nOhio, Indiana, and Illinois were flooded with the local bank notes of\\nthe Eastern States, advanced by the New York houses on produce to be\\nshipped by way of the canals in the spring.... These moneyed facilities\\nenable the packer, miller, and speculator to hold on to their produce\\nuntil the opening of navigation in the spring and they are no longer\\nobliged, as formerly, to hurry off their shipments during the winter by\\nthe way of New Orleans in order to realize funds by drafts on their\\nshipments. The banking facilities at the East are doing as much to draw\\ntrade from us as the canals and railways which Eastern capital is\\nconstructing.\" Thus canals, railways, and financial credit were swiftly\\nforging bonds of union between the old home of Jacksonian Democracy in\\nthe West and the older home of Federalism in the East. The nationalism\\nto which Webster paid eloquent tribute became more and more real with\\nthe passing of time. The self-sufficiency of the pioneer was broken down\\nas he began to watch the produce markets of New York and Philadelphia\\nwhere the prices of corn and hogs fixed his earnings for the year.\\n\\n=The West and Manufactures.=--In addition to the commercial bonds\\nbetween the East and the West there was growing up a common interest in\\nmanufactures. As skilled white labor increased in the Ohio Valley, the\\nindustries springing up in the new cities made Western life more like\\nthat of the industrial East than like that of the planting South.\\nMoreover, the Western states produced some important raw materials for\\nAmerican factories, which called for protection against foreign\\ncompetition, notably, wool, hemp, and flax. As the South had little or\\nno foreign competition in cotton and tobacco, the East could not offer\\nprotection for her raw materials in exchange for protection for\\nindustries. With the West, however, it became possible to establish\\nreciprocity in tariffs; that is, for example, to trade a high rate on\\nwool for a high rate on textiles or iron.\\n\\n=The South Dependent on the North.=--While East and West were drawing\\ntogether, the distinctions between North and South were becoming more\\nmarked; the latter, having few industries and producing little save raw\\nmaterials, was being forced into the position of a dependent section. As\\na result of the protective tariff, Southern planters were compelled to\\nturn more and more to Northern mills for their cloth, shoes, hats, hoes,\\nplows, and machinery. Nearly all the goods which they bought in Europe\\nin exchange for their produce came overseas to Northern ports, whence\\ntransshipments were made by rail and water to Southern points of\\ndistribution. Their rice, cotton, and tobacco, in as far as they were\\nnot carried to Europe in British bottoms, were transported by Northern\\nmasters. In these ways, a large part of the financial operations\\nconnected with the sale of Southern produce and the purchase of goods in\\nexchange passed into the hands of Northern merchants and bankers who,\\nnaturally, made profits from their transactions. Finally, Southern\\nplanters who wanted to buy more land and more slaves on credit borrowed\\nheavily in the North where huge accumulations made the rates of interest\\nlower than the smaller banks of the South could afford.\\n\\n=The South Reckons the Cost of Economic Dependence.=--As Southern\\ndependence upon Northern capital became more and more marked, Southern\\nleaders began to chafe at what they regarded as restraints laid upon\\ntheir enterprise. In a word, they came to look upon the planter as a\\ntribute-bearer to the manufacturer and financier. \"The South,\"\\nexpostulated De Bow, \"stands in the attitude of feeding ... a vast\\npopulation of [Northern] merchants, shipowners, capitalists, and others\\nwho, without claims on her progeny, drink up the life blood of her\\ntrade.... Where goes the value of our labor but to those who, taking\\nadvantage of our folly, ship for us, buy for us, sell to us, and, after\\nturning our own capital to their profitable account, return laden with\\nour money to enjoy their easily earned opulence at home.\"\\n\\nSouthern statisticians, not satisfied with generalities, attempted to\\nfigure out how great was this tribute in dollars and cents. They\\nestimated that the planters annually lent to Northern merchants the full\\nvalue of their exports, a hundred millions or more, \"to be used in the\\nmanipulation of foreign imports.\" They calculated that no less than\\nforty millions all told had been paid to shipowners in profits. They\\nreckoned that, if the South were to work up her own cotton, she would\\nrealize from seventy to one hundred millions a year that otherwise went\\nNorth. Finally, to cap the climax, they regretted that planters spent\\nsome fifteen millions a year pleasure-seeking in the alluring cities and\\nsummer resorts of the North.\\n\\n=Southern Opposition to Northern Policies.=--Proceeding from these\\npremises, Southern leaders drew the logical conclusion that the entire\\nprogram of economic measures demanded in the North was without exception\\nadverse to Southern interests and, by a similar chain of reasoning,\\ninjurious to the corn and wheat producers of the West. Cheap labor\\nafforded by free immigration, a protective tariff raising prices of\\nmanufactures for the tiller of the soil, ship subsidies increasing the\\ntonnage of carrying trade in Northern hands, internal improvements\\nforging new economic bonds between the East and the West, a national\\nbanking system giving strict national control over the currency as a\\nsafeguard against paper inflation--all these devices were regarded in\\nthe South as contrary to the planting interest. They were constantly\\ncompared with the restrictive measures by which Great Britain more than\\nhalf a century before had sought to bind American interests.\\n\\nAs oppression justified a war for independence once, statesmen argued,\\nso it can justify it again. \"It is curious as it is melancholy and\\ndistressing,\" came a broad hint from South Carolina, \"to see how\\nstriking is the analogy between the colonial vassalage to which the\\nmanufacturing states have reduced the planting states and that which\\nformerly bound the Anglo-American colonies to the British empire....\\nEngland said to her American colonies: \\'You shall not trade with the\\nrest of the world for such manufactures as are produced in the mother\\ncountry.\\' The manufacturing states say to their Southern colonies: \\'You\\nshall not trade with the rest of the world for such manufactures as we\\nproduce.\\'\" The conclusion was inexorable: either the South must control\\nthe national government and its economic measures, or it must declare,\\nas America had done four score years before, its political and economic\\nindependence. As Northern mills multiplied, as railways spun their\\nmighty web over the face of the North, and as accumulated capital rose\\ninto the hundreds of millions, the conviction of the planters and their\\nstatesmen deepened into desperation.\\n\\n=Efforts to Start Southern Industries Fail.=--A few of them, seeing the\\npredominance of the North, made determined efforts to introduce\\nmanufactures into the South. To the leaders who were averse to secession\\nand nullification this seemed the only remedy for the growing disparity\\nin the power of the two sections. Societies for the encouragement of\\nmechanical industries were formed, the investment of capital was sought,\\nand indeed a few mills were built on Southern soil. The results were\\nmeager. The natural resources, coal and water power, were abundant; but\\nthe enterprise for direction and the skilled labor were wanting. The\\nstream of European immigration flowed North and West, not South. The\\nIrish or German laborer, even if he finally made his home in a city, had\\nbefore him, while in the North, the alternative of a homestead on\\nWestern land. To him slavery was a strange, if not a repelling,\\ninstitution. He did not take to it kindly nor care to fix his home where\\nit flourished. While slavery lasted, the economy of the South was\\ninevitably agricultural. While agriculture predominated, leadership with\\nequal necessity fell to the planting interest. While the planting\\ninterest ruled, political opposition to Northern economy was destined to\\ngrow in strength.\\n\\n=The Southern Theory of Sectionalism.=--In the opinion of the statesmen\\nwho frankly represented the planting interest, the industrial system was\\nits deadly enemy. Their entire philosophy of American politics was\\nsummed up in a single paragraph by McDuffie, a spokesman for South\\nCarolina: \"Owing to the federative character of our government, the\\ngreat geographical extent of our territory, and the diversity of the\\npursuits of our citizens in different parts of the union, it has so\\nhappened that two great interests have sprung up, standing directly\\nopposed to each other. One of these consists of those manufactures which\\nthe Northern and Middle states are capable of producing but which, owing\\nto the high price of labor and the high profits of capital in those\\nstates, cannot hold competition with foreign manufactures without the\\naid of bounties, directly or indirectly given, either by the general\\ngovernment or by the state governments. The other of these interests\\nconsists of the great agricultural staples of the Southern states which\\ncan find a market only in foreign countries and which can be\\nadvantageously sold only in exchange for foreign manufactures which come\\nin competition with those of the Northern and Middle states.... These\\ninterests then stand diametrically and irreconcilably opposed to each\\nother. The interest, the pecuniary interest of the Northern\\nmanufacturer, is directly promoted by every increase of the taxes\\nimposed upon Southern commerce; and it is unnecessary to add that the\\ninterest of the Southern planter is promoted by every diminution of\\ntaxes imposed upon the productions of their industry. If, under these\\ncircumstances, the manufacturers were clothed with the power of imposing\\ntaxes, at their pleasure, upon the foreign imports of the planter, no\\ndoubt would exist in the mind of any man that it would have all the\\ncharacteristics of an absolute and unqualified despotism.\" The economic\\nsoundness of this reasoning, a subject of interesting speculation for\\nthe economist, is of little concern to the historian. The historical\\npoint is that this opinion was widely held in the South and with the\\nprogress of time became the prevailing doctrine of the planting\\nstatesmen.\\n\\nTheir antagonism was deepened because they also became convinced, on\\nwhat grounds it is not necessary to inquire, that the leaders of the\\nindustrial interest thus opposed to planting formed a consolidated\\n\"aristocracy of wealth,\" bent upon the pursuit and attainment of\\npolitical power at Washington. \"By the aid of various associated\\ninterests,\" continued McDuffie, \"the manufacturing capitalists have\\nobtained a complete and permanent control over the legislation of\\nCongress on this subject [the tariff].... Men confederated together upon\\nselfish and interested principles, whether in pursuit of the offices or\\nthe bounties of the government, are ever more active and vigilant than\\nthe great majority who act from disinterested and patriotic impulses.\\nHave we not witnessed it on this floor, sir? Who ever knew the tariff\\nmen to divide on any question affecting their confederated interests?...\\nThe watchword is, stick together, right or wrong upon every question\\naffecting the common cause. Such, sir, is the concert and vigilance and\\nsuch the combinations by which the manufacturing party, acting upon the\\ninterests of some and the prejudices of others, have obtained a decided\\nand permanent control over public opinion in all the tariff states.\"\\nThus, as the Southern statesman would have it, the North, in matters\\naffecting national policies, was ruled by a \"confederated interest\"\\nwhich menaced the planting interest. As the former grew in magnitude and\\nattached to itself the free farmers of the West through channels of\\ntrade and credit, it followed as night the day that in time the planters\\nwould be overshadowed and at length overborne in the struggle of giants.\\nWhether the theory was sound or not, Southern statesmen believed it and\\nacted upon it.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nM.

From\\nthe inauguration of Washington to the election of Lincoln the sectional\\nconflict, discerned by this penetrating thinker, exercised a profound\\ninfluence on the course of American politics. It was latent during the\\n\"era of good feeling\" when the Jeffersonian Republicans adopted\\nFederalist policies; it flamed up in the contest between the Democrats\\nand Whigs. Finally it raged in the angry political quarrel which\\nculminated in the Civil War.\\n\\n\\nSLAVERY--NORTH AND SOUTH\\n\\n=The Decline of Slavery in the North.=--At the time of the adoption of\\nthe Constitution, slavery was lawful in all the Northern states except\\nMassachusetts. There were almost as many bondmen in New York as in\\nGeorgia. New Jersey had more than Delaware or Tennessee, indeed nearly\\nas many as both combined. All told, however, there were only about forty\\nthousand in the North as against nearly seven hundred thousand in the\\nSouth. Moreover, most of the Northern slaves were domestic servants, not\\nlaborers necessary to keep mills going or fields under cultivation.\\n\\nThere was, in the North, a steadily growing moral sentiment against the\\nsystem. Massachusetts abandoned it in 1780. In the same year,\\nPennsylvania provided for gradual emancipation. New Hampshire, where\\nthere had been only a handful, Connecticut with a few thousand\\ndomestics, and New Jersey early followed these examples. New York, in\\n1799, declared that all children born of slaves after July 4 of that\\nyear should be free, though held for a term as apprentices; and in 1827\\nit swept away the last vestiges of slavery. So with the passing of the\\ngeneration that had framed the Constitution, chattel servitude\\ndisappeared in the commercial states, leaving behind only such\\ndiscriminations as disfranchisement or high property qualifications on\\ncolored voters.\\n\\n=The Growth of Northern Sentiment against Slavery.=--In both sections of\\nthe country there early existed, among those more or less\\nphilosophically inclined, a strong opposition to slavery on moral as\\nwell as economic grounds. In the constitutional convention of 1787,\\nGouverneur Morris had vigorously condemned it and proposed that the\\nwhole country should bear the cost of abolishing it. About the same time\\na society for promoting the abolition of slavery, under the presidency\\nof Benjamin Franklin, laid before Congress a petition that serious\\nattention be given to the emancipation of \"those unhappy men who alone\\nin this land of freedom are degraded into perpetual bondage.\" When\\nCongress, acting on the recommendations of President Jefferson, provided\\nfor the abolition of the foreign slave trade on January 1, 1808, several\\nNorthern members joined with Southern members in condemning the system\\nas well as the trade. Later, colonization societies were formed to\\nencourage the emancipation of slaves and their return to Africa. James\\nMadison was president and Henry Clay vice president of such an\\norganization.\\n\\nThe anti-slavery sentiment of which these were the signs was\\nnevertheless confined to narrow circles and bore no trace of bitterness.\\n\\n\"We consider slavery your calamity, not your crime,\" wrote a\\ndistinguished Boston clergyman to his Southern brethren, \"and we will\\nshare with you the burden of putting an end to it. We will consent that\\nthe public lands shall be appropriated to this object.... I deprecate\\neverything which sows discord and exasperating sectional animosities.\"\\n\\n=Uncompromising Abolition.=--In a little while the spirit of generosity\\nwas gone. Just as Jacksonian Democracy rose to power there appeared a\\nnew kind of anti-slavery doctrine--the dogmatism of the abolition\\nagitator. For mild speculation on the evils of the system was\\nsubstituted an imperious and belligerent demand for instant\\nemancipation. If a date must be fixed for its appearance, the year 1831\\nmay be taken when William Lloyd Garrison founded in Boston his\\nanti-slavery paper, _The Liberator_. With singleness of purpose and\\nutter contempt for all opposing opinions and arguments, he pursued his\\ncourse of passionate denunciation. He apologized for having ever\\n\"assented to the popular but pernicious doctrine of gradual abolition.\"\\nHe chose for his motto: \"Immediate and unconditional emancipation!\" He\\npromised his readers that he would be \"harsh as truth and uncompromising\\nas justice\"; that he would not \"think or speak or write with\\nmoderation.\" Then he flung out his defiant call: \"I am in earnest--I\\nwill not equivocate--I will not excuse--I will not retreat a single\\ninch--and I will be heard....\\n\\n     \\'Such is the vow I take, so help me God.\\'\"\\n\\nThough Garrison complained that \"the apathy of the people is enough to\\nmake every statue leap from its pedestal,\" he soon learned how alive the\\nmasses were to the meaning of his propaganda. Abolition orators were\\nstoned in the street and hissed from the platform. Their meeting places\\nwere often attacked and sometimes burned to the ground. Garrison himself\\nwas assaulted in the streets of Boston, finding refuge from the angry\\nmob behind prison bars. Lovejoy, a publisher in Alton, Illinois, for his\\nwillingness to give abolition a fair hearing, was brutally murdered; his\\nprinting press was broken to pieces as a warning to all those who\\ndisturbed the nation\\'s peace of mind. The South, doubly frightened by a\\nslave revolt in 1831 which ended in the murder of a number of men,\\nwomen, and children, closed all discussion of slavery in that section.\\n\"Now,\" exclaimed Calhoun, \"it is a question which admits of neither\\nconcession nor compromise.\"\\n\\nAs the opposition hardened, the anti-slavery agitation gathered in force\\nand intensity. Whittier blew his blast from the New England hills:\\n\\n    \"No slave-hunt in our borders--no pirate on our strand;\\n     No fetters in the Bay State--no slave upon our land.\"\\n\\nLowell, looking upon the espousal of a great cause as the noblest aim of\\nhis art, ridiculed and excoriated bondage in the South. Those\\nabolitionists, not gifted as speakers or writers, signed petitions\\nagainst slavery and poured them in upon Congress. The flood of them was\\nso continuous that the House of Representatives, forgetting its\\ntraditions, adopted in 1836 a \"gag rule\" which prevented the reading of\\nappeals and consigned them to the waste basket. Not until the Whigs were\\nin power nearly ten years later was John Quincy Adams able, after a\\nrelentless campaign, to carry a motion rescinding the rule.\\n\\nHow deep was the impression made upon the country by this agitation for\\nimmediate and unconditional emancipation cannot be measured. If the\\npopular vote for those candidates who opposed not slavery, but its\\nextension to the territories, be taken as a standard, it was slight\\nindeed. In 1844, the Free Soil candidate, Birney, polled 62,000 votes\\nout of over a million and a half; the Free Soil vote of the next\\ncampaign went beyond a quarter of a million, but the increase was due to\\nthe strength of the leader, Martin Van Buren; four years afterward it\\nreceded to 156,000, affording all the outward signs for the belief that\\nthe pleas of the abolitionist found no widespread response among the\\npeople. Yet the agitation undoubtedly ran deeper than the ballot box.\\nYoung statesmen of the North, in whose hands the destiny of frightful\\nyears was to lie, found their indifference to slavery broken and their\\nconsciences stirred by the unending appeal and the tireless reiteration.\\nCharles Sumner afterward boasted that he read the _Liberator_ two years\\nbefore Wendell Phillips, the young Boston lawyer who cast aside his\\nprofession to take up the dangerous cause.\\n\\n=Early Southern Opposition to Slavery.=--In the South, the sentiment\\nagainst slavery was strong; it led some to believe that it would also\\ncome to an end there in due time. Washington disliked it and directed in\\nhis will that his own slaves should be set free after the death of his\\nwife. Jefferson, looking into the future, condemned the system by which\\nhe also lived, saying: \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure\\nwhen we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of\\nthe people that their liberties are the gift of God? Are they not to be\\nviolated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I\\nreflect that God is just; that His justice cannot sleep forever.\" Nor\\ndid Southern men confine their sentiments to expressions of academic\\nopinion. They accepted in 1787 the Ordinance which excluded slavery from\\nthe Northwest territory forever and also the Missouri Compromise, which\\nshut it out of a vast section of the Louisiana territory.\\n\\n=The Revolution in the Slave System.=--Among the representatives of\\nSouth Carolina and Georgia, however, the anti-slavery views of\\nWashington and Jefferson were by no means approved; and the drift of\\nSouthern economy was decidedly in favor of extending and perpetuating,\\nrather than abolishing, the system of chattel servitude. The invention\\nof the cotton gin and textile machinery created a market for cotton\\nwhich the planters, with all their skill and energy, could hardly\\nsupply. Almost every available acre was brought under cotton culture as\\nthe small farmers were driven steadily from the seaboard into the\\nuplands or to the Northwest.\\n\\nThe demand for slaves to till the swiftly expanding fields was enormous.\\nThe number of bondmen rose from 700,000 in Washington\\'s day to more than\\nthree millions in 1850. At the same time slavery itself was transformed.\\nInstead of the homestead where the same family of masters kept the same\\nfamilies of slaves from generation to generation, came the plantation\\nsystem of the Far South and Southwest where masters were ever moving and\\never extending their holdings of lands and slaves. This in turn reacted\\non the older South where the raising of slaves for the market became a\\nregular and highly profitable business.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n\\nJOHN C. CALHOUN]\\n\\n=Slavery Defended as a Positive Good.=--As the abolition agitation\\nincreased and the planting system expanded, apologies for slavery became\\nfainter and fainter in the South. Then apologies were superseded by\\nclaims that slavery was a beneficial scheme of labor control. Calhoun,\\nin a famous speech in the Senate in 1837, sounded the new note by\\ndeclaring slavery \"instead of an evil, a good--a positive good.\" His\\nreasoning was as follows: in every civilized society one portion of the\\ncommunity must live on the labor of another; learning, science, and the\\narts are built upon leisure; the African slave, kindly treated by his\\nmaster and mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than\\nthe free laborers of Europe; and under the slave system conflicts\\nbetween capital and labor are avoided. The advantages of slavery in this\\nrespect, he concluded, \"will become more and more manifest, if left\\nundisturbed by interference from without, as the country advances in\\nwealth and numbers.\"\\n\\n=Slave Owners Dominate Politics.=--The new doctrine of Calhoun was\\neagerly seized by the planters as they came more and more to overshadow\\nthe small farmers of the South and as they beheld the menace of\\nabolition growing upon the horizon. It formed, as they viewed matters, a\\nmoral defense for their labor system--sound, logical, invincible. It\\nwarranted them in drawing together for the protection of an institution\\nso necessary, so inevitable, so beneficent.\\n\\nThough in 1850 the slave owners were only about three hundred and fifty\\nthousand in a national population of nearly twenty million whites, they\\nhad an influence all out of proportion to their numbers. They were knit\\ntogether by the bonds of a common interest. They had leisure and wealth.\\nThey could travel and attend conferences and conventions. Throughout the\\nSouth and largely in the North, they had the press, the schools, and the\\npulpits on their side. They formed, as it were, a mighty union for the\\nprotection and advancement of their common cause. Aided by those\\nmechanics and farmers of the North who stuck by Jacksonian Democracy\\nthrough thick and thin, the planters became a power in the federal\\ngovernment. \"We nominate Presidents,\" exultantly boasted a Richmond\\nnewspaper; \"the North elects them.\"\\n\\nThis jubilant Southern claim was conceded by William H. Seward, a\\nRepublican Senator from New York, in a speech describing the power of\\nslavery in the national government. \"A party,\" he said, \"is in one sense\\na joint stock association, in which those who contribute most direct the\\naction and management of the concern.... The slaveholders, contributing\\nin an overwhelming proportion to the strength of the Democratic party,\\nnecessarily dictate and prescribe its policy.\" He went on: \"The\\nslaveholding class has become the governing power in each of the\\nslaveholding states and it practically chooses thirty of the sixty-two\\nmembers of the Senate, ninety of the two hundred and thirty-three\\nmembers of the House of Representatives, and one hundred and five of the\\ntwo hundred and ninety-five electors of President and Vice-President of\\nthe United States.\" Then he considered the slave power in the Supreme\\nCourt. \"That tribunal,\" he exclaimed, \"consists of a chief justice and\\neight associate justices. Of these, five were called from slave states\\nand four from free states. The opinions and bias of each of them were\\ncarefully considered by the President and Senate when he was appointed.\\nNot one of them was found wanting in soundness of politics, according to\\nthe slaveholder\\'s exposition of the Constitution.\" Such was the Northern\\nview of the planting interest that, from the arena of national politics,\\nchallenged the whole country in 1860.\\n\\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF SLAVES IN THE SOUTHERN STATES]\\n\\n\\nSLAVERY IN NATIONAL POLITICS\\n\\n=National Aspects of Slavery.=--It may be asked why it was that slavery,\\nfounded originally on state law and subject to state government, was\\ndrawn into the current of national affairs. The answer is simple. There\\nwere, in the first place, constitutional reasons. The Congress of the\\nUnited States had to make all needful rules for the government of the\\nterritories, the District of Columbia, the forts and other property\\nunder national authority; so it was compelled to determine whether\\nslavery should exist in the places subject to its jurisdiction. Upon\\nCongress was also conferred the power of admitting new states; whenever\\na territory asked for admission, the issue could be raised as to whether\\nslavery should be sanctioned or excluded. Under the Constitution,\\nprovision was made for the return of runaway slaves; Congress had the\\npower to enforce this clause by appropriate legislation. Since the\\ncontrol of the post office was vested in the federal government, it had\\nto face the problem raised by the transmission of abolition literature\\nthrough the mails. Finally citizens had the right of petition; it\\ninheres in all free government and it is expressly guaranteed by the\\nfirst amendment to the Constitution. It was therefore legal for\\nabolitionists to present to Congress their petitions, even if they asked\\nfor something which it had no right to grant. It was thus impossible,\\nconstitutionally, to draw a cordon around the slavery issue and confine\\nthe discussion of it to state politics.\\n\\nThere were, in the second place, economic reasons why slavery was\\ninevitably drawn into the national sphere. It was the basis of the\\nplanting system which had direct commercial relations with the North and\\nEuropean countries; it was affected by federal laws respecting tariffs,\\nbounties, ship subsidies, banking, and kindred matters. The planters of\\nthe South, almost without exception, looked upon the protective tariff\\nas a tribute laid upon them for the benefit of Northern industries. As\\nheavy borrowers of money in the North, they were generally in favor of\\n\"easy money,\" if not paper currency, as an aid in the repayment of their\\ndebts. This threw most of them into opposition to the Whig program for a\\nUnited States Bank. All financial aids to American shipping they stoutly\\nresisted, preferring to rely upon the cheaper service rendered by\\nEnglish shippers. Internal improvements, those substantial ties that\\nwere binding the West to the East and turning the traffic from New\\nOrleans to Philadelphia and New York, they viewed with alarm. Free\\nhomesteads from the public lands, which tended to overbalance the South\\nby building free states, became to them a measure dangerous to their\\ninterests. Thus national economic policies, which could not by any twist\\nor turn be confined to state control, drew the slave system and its\\ndefenders into the political conflict that centered at Washington.\\n\\n=Slavery and the Territories--the Missouri Compromise (1820).=--Though\\nmen continually talked about \"taking slavery out of politics,\" it could\\nnot be done. By 1818 slavery had become so entrenched and the\\nanti-slavery sentiment so strong, that Missouri\\'s quest for admission\\nbrought both houses of Congress into a deadlock that was broken only by\\ncompromise. The South, having half the Senators, could prevent the\\nadmission of Missouri stripped of slavery; and the North, powerful in\\nthe House of Representatives, could keep Missouri with slavery out of\\nthe union indefinitely. An adjustment of pretensions was the last\\nresort. Maine, separated from the parent state of Massachusetts, was\\nbrought into the union with freedom and Missouri with bondage. At the\\nsame time it was agreed that the remainder of the vast Louisiana\\nterritory north of the parallel of 36 o 30\\' should be, like the old\\nNorthwest, forever free; while the southern portion was left to slavery.\\nIn reality this was an immense gain for liberty. The area dedicated to\\nfree farmers was many times greater than that left to the planters. The\\nprinciple was once more asserted that Congress had full power to prevent\\nslavery in the territories.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE]\\n\\n=The Territorial Question Reopened by the Wilmot Proviso.=--To the\\nSouthern leaders, the annexation of Texas and the conquest of Mexico\\nmeant renewed security to the planting interest against the increasing\\nwealth and population of the North. Texas, it was said, could be divided\\ninto four slave states. The new territories secured by the treaty of\\npeace with Mexico contained the promise of at least three more. Thus, as\\neach new free soil state knocked for admission into the union, the\\nSouth could demand as the price of its consent a new slave state. No\\nwonder Southern statesmen saw, in the annexation of Texas and the\\nconquest of Mexico, slavery and King Cotton triumphant--secure for all\\ntime against adverse legislation. Northern leaders were equally\\nconvinced that the Southern prophecy was true. Abolitionists and\\nmoderate opponents of slavery alike were in despair. Texas, they\\nlamented, would fasten slavery upon the country forevermore. \"No living\\nman,\" cried one, \"will see the end of slavery in the United States!\"\\n\\nIt so happened, however, that the events which, it was thought, would\\nsecure slavery let loose a storm against it. A sign appeared first on\\nAugust 6, 1846, only a few months after war was declared on Mexico. On\\nthat day, David Wilmot, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, introduced into\\nthe House of Representatives a resolution to the effect that, as an\\nexpress and fundamental condition to the acquisition of any territory\\nfrom the republic of Mexico, slavery should be forever excluded from\\nevery part of it. \"The Wilmot Proviso,\" as the resolution was popularly\\ncalled, though defeated on that occasion, was a challenge to the South.\\n\\nThe South answered the challenge. Speaking in the House of\\nRepresentatives, Robert Toombs of Georgia boldly declared: \"In the\\npresence of the living God, if by your legislation you seek to drive us\\nfrom the territories of California and New Mexico ... I am for\\ndisunion.\" South Carolina announced that the day for talk had passed and\\nthe time had come to join her sister states \"in resisting the\\napplication of the Wilmot Proviso at any and all hazards.\" A conference,\\nassembled at Jackson, Mississippi, in the autumn of 1849, called a\\ngeneral convention of Southern states to meet at Nashville the following\\nsummer. The avowed purpose was to arrest \"the course of aggression\" and,\\nif that was not possible, to provide \"in the last resort for their\\nseparate welfare by the formation of a compact and union that will\\nafford protection to their liberties and rights.\" States that had\\nspurned South Carolina\\'s plea for nullification in 1832 responded to\\nthis new appeal with alacrity--an augury of the secession to come.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print._\\n\\nHENRY CLAY]\\n\\n=The Great Debate of 1850.=--The temper of the country was white hot\\nwhen Congress convened in December, 1849. It was a memorable session,\\nmemorable for the great men who took part in the debates and memorable\\nfor the grand Compromise of 1850 which it produced. In the Senate sat\\nfor the last time three heroic figures: Webster from the North, Calhoun\\nfrom the South, and Clay from a border state. For nearly forty years\\nthese three had been leaders of men. All had grown old and gray in\\nservice. Calhoun was already broken in health and in a few months was to\\nbe borne from the political arena forever. Clay and Webster had but two\\nmore years in their allotted span.\\n\\nExperience, learning, statecraft--all these things they now marshaled in\\na mighty effort to solve the slavery problem. On January 29, 1850, Clay\\noffered to the Senate a compromise granting concessions to both sides;\\nand a few days later, in a powerful oration, he made a passionate appeal\\nfor a union of hearts through mutual sacrifices. Calhoun relentlessly\\ndemanded the full measure of justice for the South: equal rights in the\\nterritories bought by common blood; the return of runaway slaves as\\nrequired by the Constitution; the suppression of the abolitionists; and\\nthe restoration of the balance of power between the North and the South.\\nWebster, in his notable \"Seventh of March speech,\" condemned the Wilmot\\nProviso, advocated a strict enforcement of the fugitive slave law,\\ndenounced the abolitionists, and made a final plea for the Constitution,\\nunion, and liberty. This was the address which called forth from\\nWhittier the poem, \"Ichabod,\" deploring the fall of the mighty one whom\\nhe thought lost to all sense of faith and honor.\\n\\n=The Terms of the Compromise of 1850.=--When the debates were closed,\\nthe results were totaled in a series of compromise measures, all of\\nwhich were signed in September, 1850, by the new President, Millard\\nFillmore, who had taken office two months before on the death of Zachary\\nTaylor. By these acts the boundaries of Texas were adjusted and the\\nterritory of New Mexico created, subject to the provision that all or\\nany part of it might be admitted to the union \"with or without slavery\\nas their constitution may provide at the time of their admission.\" The\\nTerritory of Utah was similarly organized with the same conditions as to\\nslavery, thus repudiating the Wilmot Proviso without guaranteeing\\nslavery to the planters. California was admitted as a free state under a\\nconstitution in which the people of the territory had themselves\\nprohibited slavery.\\n\\nThe slave trade was abolished in the District of Columbia, but slavery\\nitself existed as before at the capital of the nation. This concession\\nto anti-slavery sentiment was more than offset by a fugitive slave law,\\ndrastic in spirit and in letter. It placed the enforcement of its terms\\nin the hands of federal officers appointed from Washington and so\\nremoved it from the control of authorities locally elected. It provided\\nthat masters or their agents, on filing claims in due form, might\\nsummarily remove their escaped slaves without affording their \"alleged\\nfugitives\" the right of trial by jury, the right to witness, the right\\nto offer any testimony in evidence. Finally, to \"put teeth\" into the\\nact, heavy penalties were prescribed for all who obstructed or assisted\\nin obstructing the enforcement of the law. Such was the Great Compromise\\nof 1850.\\n\\n[Illustration: AN OLD CARTOON REPRESENTING WEBSTER \"STEALING CLAY\\'S\\nTHUNDER\"]\\n\\n=The Pro-slavery Triumph in the Election of 1852.=--The results of the\\nelection of 1852 seemed to show conclusively that the nation was weary\\nof slavery agitation and wanted peace. Both parties, Whigs and\\nDemocrats, endorsed the fugitive slave law and approved the Great\\nCompromise. The Democrats, with Franklin Pierce as their leader, swept\\nthe country against the war hero, General Winfield Scott, on whom the\\nWhigs had staked their hopes. Even Webster, broken with grief at his\\nfailure to receive the nomination, advised his friends to vote for\\nPierce and turned away from politics to meditate upon approaching death.\\nThe verdict of the voters would seem to indicate that for the time\\neverybody, save a handful of disgruntled agitators, looked upon Clay\\'s\\nsettlement as the last word. \"The people, especially the business men of\\nthe country,\" says Elson, \"were utterly weary of the agitation and they\\ngave their suffrages to the party that promised them rest.\" The Free\\nSoil party, condemning slavery as \"a sin against God and a crime against\\nman,\" and advocating freedom for the territories, failed to carry a\\nsingle state. In fact it polled fewer votes than it had four years\\nearlier--156,000 as against nearly 3,000,000, the combined vote of the\\nWhigs and Democrats. It is not surprising, therefore, that President\\nPierce, surrounded in his cabinet by strong Southern sympathizers, could\\npromise to put an end to slavery agitation and to crush the abolition\\nmovement in the bud.\\n\\n=Anti-slavery Agitation Continued.=--The promise was more difficult to\\nfulfill than to utter. In fact, the vigorous execution of one measure\\nincluded in the Compromise--the fugitive slave law--only made matters\\nworse. Designed as security for the planters, it proved a powerful\\ninstrument in their undoing. Slavery five hundred miles away on a\\nLouisiana plantation was so remote from the North that only the\\nstrongest imagination could maintain a constant rage against it. \"Slave\\ncatching,\" \"man hunting\" by federal officers on the streets of\\nPhiladelphia, New York, Boston, Chicago, or Milwaukee and in the hamlets\\nand villages of the wide-stretching farm lands of the North was another\\nmatter. It brought the most odious aspects of slavery home to thousands\\nof men and women who would otherwise have been indifferent to the\\nsystem. Law-abiding business men, mechanics, farmers, and women, when\\nthey saw peaceful negroes, who had resided in their neighborhoods\\nperhaps for years, torn away by federal officers and carried back to\\nbondage, were transformed into enemies of the law. They helped slaves to\\nescape; they snatched them away from officers who had captured them;\\nthey broke open jails and carried fugitives off to Canada.\\n\\nAssistance to runaway slaves, always more or less common in the North,\\nwas by this time organized into a system. Regular routes, known as\\n\"underground railways,\" were laid out across the free states into\\nCanada, and trusted friends of freedom maintained \"underground stations\"\\nwhere fugitives were concealed in the daytime between their long night\\njourneys. Funds were raised and secret agents sent into the South to\\nhelp negroes to flee. One negro woman, Harriet Tubman, \"the Moses of her\\npeople,\" with headquarters at Philadelphia, is accredited with nineteen\\ninvasions into slave territory and the emancipation of three hundred\\nnegroes. Those who worked at this business were in constant peril. One\\nunderground operator, Calvin Fairbank, spent nearly twenty years in\\nprison for aiding fugitives from justice. Yet perils and prisons did not\\nstay those determined men and women who, in obedience to their\\nconsciences, set themselves to this lawless work.\\n\\n[Illustration: HARRIET BEECHER STOWE]\\n\\nFrom thrilling stories of adventure along the underground railways came\\nsome of the scenes and themes of the novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe,\\n\"Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin,\" published two years after the Compromise of 1850.\\nHer stirring tale set forth the worst features of slavery in vivid word\\npictures that caught and held the attention of millions of readers.\\nThough the book was unfair to the South and was denounced as a hideous\\ndistortion of the truth, it was quickly dramatized and played in every\\ncity and town throughout the North. Topsy, Little Eva, Uncle Tom, the\\nfleeing slave, Eliza Harris, and the cruel slave driver, Simon Legree,\\nwith his baying blood hounds, became living specters in many a home that\\nsought to bar the door to the \"unpleasant and irritating business of\\nslavery agitation.\"\\n\\n\\nTHE DRIFT OF EVENTS TOWARD THE IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT\\n\\n=Repeal of the Missouri Compromise.=--To practical men, after all, the\\n\"rub-a-dub\" agitation of a few abolitionists, an occasional riot over\\nfugitive slaves, and the vogue of a popular novel seemed of slight or\\ntransient importance. They could point with satisfaction to the election\\nreturns of 1852; but their very security was founded upon shifting\\nsands. The magnificent triumph of the pro-slavery Democrats in 1852\\nbrought a turn in affairs that destroyed the foundations under their\\nfeet. Emboldened by their own strength and the weakness of their\\nopponents, they now dared to repeal the Missouri Compromise. The leader\\nin this fateful enterprise was Stephen A. Douglas, Senator from\\nIllinois, and the occasion for the deed was the demand for the\\norganization of territorial government in the regions west of Iowa and\\nMissouri.\\n\\nDouglas, like Clay and Webster before him, was consumed by a strong\\npassion for the presidency, and, to reach his goal, it was necessary to\\nwin the support of the South. This he undoubtedly sought to do when he\\nintroduced on January 4, 1854, a bill organizing the Nebraska territory\\non the principle of the Compromise of 1850; namely, that the people in\\nthe territory might themselves decide whether they would have slavery or\\nnot. Unwittingly the avalanche was started.\\n\\nAfter a stormy debate, in which important amendments were forced on\\nDouglas, the Kansas-Nebraska Bill became a law on May 30, 1854. The\\nmeasure created two territories, Kansas and Nebraska, and provided that\\nthey, or territories organized out of them, could come into the union as\\nstates \"with or without slavery as their constitutions may prescribe at\\nthe time of their admission.\" Not content with this, the law went on to\\ndeclare the Missouri Compromise null and void as being inconsistent with\\nthe principle of non-intervention by Congress with slavery in the states\\nand territories. Thus by a single blow the very heart of the continent,\\ndedicated to freedom by solemn agreement, was thrown open to slavery. A\\ndesperate struggle between slave owners and the advocates of freedom was\\nthe outcome in Kansas.\\n\\nIf Douglas fancied that the North would receive the overthrow of the\\nMissouri Compromise in the same temper that it greeted Clay\\'s\\nsettlement, he was rapidly disillusioned. A blast of rage, terrific in\\nits fury, swept from Maine to Iowa. Staid old Boston hanged him in\\neffigy with an inscription--\"Stephen A. Douglas, author of the infamous\\nNebraska bill: the Benedict Arnold of 1854.\" City after city burned him\\nin effigy until, as he himself said, he could travel from the Atlantic\\ncoast to Chicago in the light of the fires. Thousands of Whigs and\\nFree-soil Democrats deserted their parties which had sanctioned or at\\nleast tolerated the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, declaring that the startling\\nmeasure showed an evident resolve on the part of the planters to rule\\nthe whole country. A gage of defiance was thrown down to the\\nabolitionists. An issue was set even for the moderate and timid who had\\nbeen unmoved by the agitation over slavery in the Far South. That issue\\nwas whether slavery was to be confined within its existing boundaries or\\nbe allowed to spread without interference, thereby placing the free\\nstates in the minority and surrendering the federal government wholly to\\nthe slave power.\\n\\n=The Rise of the Republican Party.=--Events of terrible significance,\\nswiftly following, drove the country like a ship before a gale straight\\ninto civil war. The Kansas-Nebraska Bill rent the old parties asunder\\nand called into being the Republican party. While that bill was pending\\nin Congress, many Northern Whigs and Democrats had come to the\\nconclusion that a new party dedicated to freedom in the territories must\\nfollow the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Several places claim to be\\nthe original home of the Republican party; but historians generally\\nyield it to Wisconsin. At Ripon in that state, a mass meeting of Whigs\\nand Democrats assembled in February, 1854, and resolved to form a new\\nparty if the Kansas-Nebraska Bill should pass. At a second meeting a\\nfusion committee representing Whigs, Free Soilers, and Democrats was\\nformed and the name Republican--the name of Jefferson\\'s old party--was\\nselected. All over the country similar meetings were held and political\\ncommittees were organized.\\n\\nWhen the presidential campaign of 1856 began the Republicans entered the\\ncontest. After a preliminary conference in Pittsburgh in February, they\\nheld a convention in Philadelphia at which was drawn up a platform\\nopposing the extension of slavery to the territories. John C. Fremont,\\nthe distinguished explorer, was named for the presidency. The results\\nof the election were astounding as compared with the Free-soil failure\\nof the preceding election. Prominent men like Longfellow, Washington\\nIrving, William Cullen Bryant, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and George William\\nCurtis went over to the new party and 1,341,264 votes were rolled up for\\n\"free labor, free speech, free men, free Kansas, and Fremont.\"\\nNevertheless the victory of the Democrats was decisive. Their candidate,\\nJames Buchanan of Pennsylvania, was elected by a majority of 174 to 114\\nelectoral votes.\\n\\n[Illustration: SLAVE AND FREE SOIL ON EVE OF CIVIL WAR]\\n\\n=The Dred Scott Decision (1857).=--In his inaugural, Buchanan vaguely\\nhinted that in a forthcoming decision the Supreme Court would settle one\\nof the vital questions of the day. This was a reference to the Dred\\nScott case then pending. Scott was a slave who had been taken by his\\nmaster into the upper Louisiana territory, where freedom had been\\nestablished by the Missouri Compromise, and then carried back into his\\nold state of Missouri. He brought suit for his liberty on the ground\\nthat his residence in the free territory made him free. This raised the\\nquestion whether the law of Congress prohibiting slavery north of 36 o\\n30\\' was authorized by the federal Constitution or not. The Court might\\nhave avoided answering it by saying that even though Scott was free in\\nthe territory, he became a slave again in Missouri by virtue of the law\\nof that state. The Court, however, faced the issue squarely. It held\\nthat Scott had not been free anywhere and that, besides, the Missouri\\nCompromise violated the Constitution and was null and void.\\n\\nThe decision was a triumph for the South. It meant that Congress after\\nall had no power to abolish slavery in the territories. Under the decree\\nof the highest court in the land, that could be done only by an\\namendment to the Constitution which required a two-thirds vote in\\nCongress and the approval of three-fourths of the states. Such an\\namendment was obviously impossible--the Southern states were too\\nnumerous; but the Republicans were not daunted. \"We know,\" said Lincoln,\\n\"the Court that made it has often overruled its own decisions and we\\nshall do what we can to have it overrule this.\" Legislatures of Northern\\nstates passed resolutions condemning the decision and the Republican\\nplatform of 1860 characterized the dogma that the Constitution carried\\nslavery into the territories as \"a dangerous political heresy at\\nvariance with the explicit provisions of that instrument itself ... with\\nlegislative and judicial precedent ... revolutionary in tendency and\\nsubversive of the peace and harmony of the country.\"\\n\\n=The Panic of 1857.=--In the midst of the acrimonious dispute over the\\nDred Scott decision, came one of the worst business panics which ever\\nafflicted the country. In the spring and summer of 1857, fourteen\\nrailroad corporations, including the Erie, Michigan Central, and the\\nIllinois Central, failed to meet their obligations; banks and insurance\\ncompanies, some of them the largest and strongest institutions in the\\nNorth, closed their doors; stocks and bonds came down in a crash on the\\nmarkets; manufacturing was paralyzed; tens of thousands of working\\npeople were thrown out of employment; \"hunger meetings\" of idle men were\\nheld in the cities and banners bearing the inscription, \"We want\\nbread,\" were flung out. In New York, working men threatened to invade\\nthe Council Chamber to demand \"work or bread,\" and the frightened mayor\\ncalled for the police and soldiers. For this distressing state of\\naffairs many remedies were offered; none with more zeal and persistence\\nthan the proposal for a higher tariff to take the place of the law of\\nMarch, 1857, a Democratic measure making drastic reductions in the rates\\nof duty. In the manufacturing districts of the North, the panic was\\nascribed to the \"Democratic assault on business.\" So an old issue was\\nagain vigorously advanced, preparatory to the next presidential\\ncampaign.\\n\\n=The Lincoln-Douglas Debates.=--The following year the interest of the\\nwhole country was drawn to a series of debates held in Illinois by\\nLincoln and Douglas, both candidates for the United States Senate. In\\nthe course of his campaign Lincoln had uttered his trenchant saying that\\n\"a house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government\\ncannot endure permanently half slave and half free.\" At the same time he\\nhad accused Douglas, Buchanan, and the Supreme Court of acting in\\nconcert to make slavery national. This daring statement arrested the\\nattention of Douglas, who was making his campaign on the doctrine of\\n\"squatter sovereignty;\" that is, the right of the people of each\\nterritory \"to vote slavery up or down.\" After a few long-distance shots\\nat each other, the candidates agreed to meet face to face and discuss\\nthe issues of the day. Never had such crowds been seen at political\\nmeetings in Illinois. Farmers deserted their plows, smiths their forges,\\nand housewives their baking to hear \"Honest Abe\" and \"the Little Giant.\"\\n\\nThe results of the series of debates were momentous. Lincoln clearly\\ndefined his position. The South, he admitted, was entitled under the\\nConstitution to a fair, fugitive slave law. He hoped that there might be\\nno new slave states; but he did not see how Congress could exclude the\\npeople of a territory from admission as a state if they saw fit to adopt\\na constitution legalizing the ownership of slaves. He favored the\\ngradual abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia and the total\\nexclusion of it from the territories of the United States by act of\\nCongress.\\n\\nMoreover, he drove Douglas into a hole by asking how he squared\\n\"squatter sovereignty\" with the Dred Scott decision; how, in other\\nwords, the people of a territory could abolish slavery when the Court\\nhad declared that Congress, the superior power, could not do it under\\nthe Constitution? To this baffling question Douglas lamely replied that\\nthe inhabitants of a territory, by \"unfriendly legislation,\" might make\\nproperty in slaves insecure and thus destroy the institution. This\\nanswer to Lincoln\\'s query alienated many Southern Democrats who believed\\nthat the Dred Scott decision settled the question of slavery in the\\nterritories for all time. Douglas won the election to the Senate; but\\nLincoln, lifted into national fame by the debates, beat him in the\\ncampaign for President two years later.\\n\\n=John Brown\\'s Raid.=--To the abolitionists the line of argument pursued\\nby Lincoln, including his proposal to leave slavery untouched in the\\nstates where it existed, was wholly unsatisfactory. One of them, a grim\\nand resolute man, inflamed by a hatred for slavery in itself, turned\\nfrom agitation to violence. \"These men are all talk; what is needed is\\naction--action!\" So spoke John Brown of New York. During the sanguinary\\nstruggle in Kansas he hurried to the frontier, gun and dagger in hand,\\nto help drive slave owners from the free soil of the West. There he\\ncommitted deeds of such daring and cruelty that he was outlawed and a\\nprice put upon his head. Still he kept on the path of \"action.\" Aided by\\nfunds from Northern friends, he gathered a small band of his followers\\naround him, saying to them: \"If God be for us, who can be against us?\"\\nHe went into Virginia in the autumn of 1859, hoping, as he explained,\\n\"to effect a mighty conquest even though it be like the last victory of\\nSamson.\" He seized the government armory at Harper\\'s Ferry, declared\\nfree the slaves whom he found, and called upon them to take up arms in\\ndefense of their liberty. His was a hope as forlorn as it was desperate.\\nArmed forces came down upon him and, after a hard battle, captured him.\\nTried for treason, Brown was condemned to death. The governor of\\nVirginia turned a deaf ear to pleas for clemency based on the ground\\nthat the prisoner was simply a lunatic. \"This is a beautiful country,\"\\nsaid the stern old Brown glancing upward to the eternal hills on his way\\nto the gallows, as calmly as if he were returning home from a long\\njourney. \"So perish all such enemies of Virginia. All such enemies of\\nthe Union. All such foes of the human race,\" solemnly announced the\\nexecutioner as he fulfilled the judgment of the law.\\n\\nThe raid and its grim ending deeply moved the country. Abolitionists\\nlooked upon Brown as a martyr and tolled funeral bells on the day of his\\nexecution. Longfellow wrote in his diary: \"This will be a great day in\\nour history; the date of a new revolution as much needed as the old\\none.\" Jefferson Davis saw in the affair \"the invasion of a state by a\\nmurderous gang of abolitionists bent on inciting slaves to murder\\nhelpless women and children\"--a crime for which the leader had met a\\nfelon\\'s death. Lincoln spoke of the raid as absurd, the deed of an\\nenthusiast who had brooded over the oppression of a people until he\\nfancied himself commissioned by heaven to liberate them--an attempt\\nwhich ended in \"little else than his own execution.\" To Republican\\nleaders as a whole, the event was very embarrassing. They were taunted\\nby the Democrats with responsibility for the deed. Douglas declared his\\n\"firm and deliberate conviction that the Harper\\'s Ferry crime was the\\nnatural, logical, inevitable result of the doctrines and teachings of\\nthe Republican party.\" So persistent were such attacks that the\\nRepublicans felt called upon in 1860 to denounce Brown\\'s raid \"as among\\nthe gravest of crimes.\"\\n\\n=The Democrats Divided.=--When the Democratic convention met at\\nCharleston in the spring of 1860, a few months after Brown\\'s execution,\\nit soon became clear that there was danger ahead. Between the extreme\\nslavery advocates of the Far South and the so-called pro-slavery\\nDemocrats of the Douglas type, there was a chasm which no appeals to\\nparty loyalty could bridge. As the spokesman of the West, Douglas knew\\nthat, while the North was not abolitionist, it was passionately set\\nagainst an extension of slavery into the territories by act of Congress;\\nthat squatter sovereignty was the mildest kind of compromise acceptable\\nto the farmers whose votes would determine the fate of the election.\\nSouthern leaders would not accept his opinion. Yancey, speaking for\\nAlabama, refused to palter with any plan not built on the proposition\\nthat slavery was in itself right. He taunted the Northern Democrats with\\ntaking the view that slavery was wrong, but that they could not do\\nanything about it. That, he said, was the fatal error--the cause of all\\ndiscord, the source of \"Black Republicanism,\" as well as squatter\\nsovereignty. The gauntlet was thus thrown down at the feet of the\\nNorthern delegates: \"You must not apologize for slavery; you must\\ndeclare it right; you must advocate its extension.\" The challenge, so\\nbluntly put, was as bluntly answered. \"Gentlemen of the South,\"\\nresponded a delegate from Ohio, \"you mistake us. You mistake us. We will\\nnot do it.\"\\n\\nFor ten days the Charleston convention wrangled over the platform and\\nballoted for the nomination of a candidate. Douglas, though in the lead,\\ncould not get the two-thirds vote required for victory. For more than\\nfifty times the roll of the convention was called without a decision.\\nThen in sheer desperation the convention adjourned to meet later at\\nBaltimore. When the delegates again assembled, their passions ran as\\nhigh as ever. The division into two irreconcilable factions was\\nunchanged. Uncompromising delegates from the South withdrew to Richmond,\\nnominated John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky for President, and put forth\\na platform asserting the rights of slave owners in the territories and\\nthe duty of the federal government to protect them. The delegates who\\nremained at Baltimore nominated Douglas and endorsed his doctrine of\\nsquatter sovereignty.\\n\\n=The Constitutional Union Party.=--While the Democratic party was being\\ndisrupted, a fragment of the former Whig party, known as the\\nConstitutional Unionists, held a convention at Baltimore and selected\\nnational candidates: John Bell from Tennessee and Edward Everett from\\nMassachusetts. A melancholy interest attached to this assembly. It was\\nmainly composed of old men whose political views were those of Clay and\\nWebster, cherished leaders now dead and gone. In their platform they\\nsought to exorcise the evil spirit of partisanship by inviting their\\nfellow citizens to \"support the Constitution of the country, the union\\nof the states, and the enforcement of the laws.\" The party that\\ncampaigned on this grand sentiment only drew laughter from the Democrats\\nand derision from the Republicans and polled less than one-fourth the\\nvotes.\\n\\n=The Republican Convention.=--With the Whigs definitely forced into a\\nseparate group, the Republican convention at Chicago was fated to be\\nsectional in character, although five slave states did send delegates.\\nAs the Democrats were split, the party that had led a forlorn hope four\\nyears before was on the high road to success at last. New and powerful\\nrecruits were found. The advocates of a high protective tariff and the\\nfriends of free homesteads for farmers and workingmen mingled with\\nenthusiastic foes of slavery. While still firm in their opposition to\\nslavery in the territories, the Republicans went on record in favor of a\\nhomestead law granting free lands to settlers and approved customs\\nduties designed \"to encourage the development of the industrial\\ninterests of the whole country.\" The platform was greeted with cheers\\nwhich, according to the stenographic report of the convention, became\\nloud and prolonged as the protective tariff and homestead planks were\\nread.\\n\\nHaving skillfully drawn a platform to unite the North in opposition to\\nslavery and the planting system, the Republicans were also adroit in\\ntheir selection of a candidate. The tariff plank might carry\\nPennsylvania, a Democratic state; but Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were\\nequally essential to success at the polls. The southern counties of\\nthese states were filled with settlers from Virginia, North Carolina,\\nand Kentucky who, even if they had no love for slavery, were no friends\\nof abolition. Moreover, remembering the old fight on the United States\\nBank in Andrew Jackson\\'s day, they were suspicious of men from the East.\\nAccordingly, they did not favor the candidacy of Seward, the leading\\nRepublican statesman and \"favorite son\" of New York.\\n\\nAfter much trading and discussing, the convention came to the conclusion\\nthat Abraham Lincoln of Illinois was the most \"available\" candidate. He\\nwas of Southern origin, born in Kentucky in 1809, a fact that told\\nheavily in the campaign in the Ohio Valley. He was a man of the soil,\\nthe son of poor frontier parents, a pioneer who in his youth had labored\\nin the fields and forests, celebrated far and wide as \"honest Abe, the\\nrail-splitter.\" It was well-known that he disliked slavery, but was no\\nabolitionist. He had come dangerously near to Seward\\'s radicalism in his\\n\"house-divided-against-itself\" speech but he had never committed himself\\nto the reckless doctrine that there was a \"higher law\" than the\\nConstitution. Slavery in the South he tolerated as a bitter fact;\\nslavery in the territories he opposed with all his strength. Of his\\nsincerity there could be no doubt. He was a speaker and writer of\\nsingular power, commanding, by the use of simple and homely language,\\nthe hearts and minds of those who heard him speak or read his printed\\nwords. He had gone far enough in his opposition to slavery; but not too\\nfar. He was the man of the hour! Amid lusty cheers from ten thousand\\nthroats, Lincoln was nominated for the presidency by the Republicans. In\\nthe ensuing election, he carried all the free states except New Jersey.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nP.E. Chadwick, _Causes of the Civil War_ (American Nation Series).\\n\\nW.E.

If that calamity comes to pass, responded the governor\\nof the state, the answer should be a declaration of independence. In a\\nfew days the suspense was over. The news of Lincoln\\'s election came\\nspeeding along the wires. Prepared for the event, the editor of the\\nCharleston _Mercury_ unfurled the flag of his state amid wild cheers\\nfrom an excited throng in the streets. Then he seized his pen and wrote:\\n\"The tea has been thrown overboard; the revolution of 1860 has been\\ninitiated.\" The issue was submitted to the voters in the choice of\\ndelegates to a state convention called to cast off the yoke of the\\nConstitution.\\n\\n\\nTHE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY\\n\\n=Secession.=--As arranged, the convention of South Carolina assembled in\\nDecember and without a dissenting voice passed the ordinance of\\nsecession withdrawing from the union. Bells were rung exultantly, the\\nroar of cannon carried the news to outlying counties, fireworks lighted\\nup the heavens, and champagne flowed. The crisis so long expected had\\ncome at last; even the conservatives who had prayed that they might\\nescape the dreadful crash greeted it with a sigh of relief.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1861\\n\\nThe border states (in purple) remained loyal.]\\n\\nSouth Carolina now sent forth an appeal to her sister states--states\\nthat had in Jackson\\'s day repudiated nullification as leading to \"the\\ndissolution of the union.\" The answer that came this time was in a\\ndifferent vein. A month had hardly elapsed before five other\\nstates--Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana--had\\nwithdrawn from the union. In February, Texas followed. Virginia,\\nhesitating until the bombardment of Fort Sumter forced a conclusion,\\nseceded in April; but fifty-five of the one hundred and forty-three\\ndelegates dissented, foreshadowing the creation of the new state of West\\nVirginia which Congress admitted to the union in 1863. In May, North\\nCarolina, Arkansas, and Tennessee announced their independence.\\n\\n=Secession and the Theories of the Union.=--In severing their relations\\nwith the union, the seceding states denied every point in the Northern\\ntheory of the Constitution. That theory, as every one knows, was\\ncarefully formulated by Webster and elaborated by Lincoln. According to\\nit, the union was older than the states; it was created before the\\nDeclaration of Independence for the purpose of common defense. The\\nArticles of Confederation did but strengthen this national bond and the\\nConstitution sealed it forever. The federal government was not a\\ncreature of state governments. It was erected by the people and derived\\nits powers directly from them. \"It is,\" said Webster, \"the people\\'s\\nConstitution, the people\\'s government; made for the people; made by the\\npeople; and answerable to the people. The people of the United States\\nhave declared that this Constitution shall be the supreme law.\" When a\\nstate questions the lawfulness of any act of the federal government, it\\ncannot nullify that act or withdraw from the union; it must abide by the\\ndecision of the Supreme Court of the United States. The union of these\\nstates is perpetual, ran Lincoln\\'s simple argument in the first\\ninaugural; the federal Constitution has no provision for its own\\ntermination; it can be destroyed only by some action not provided for in\\nthe instrument itself; even if it is a compact among all the states the\\nconsent of all must be necessary to its dissolution; therefore no state\\ncan lawfully get out of the union and acts of violence against the\\nUnited States are insurrectionary or revolutionary. This was the system\\nwhich he believed himself bound to defend by his oath of office\\n\"registered in heaven.\"\\n\\nAll this reasoning Southern statesmen utterly rejected. In their opinion\\nthe thirteen original states won their independence as separate and\\nsovereign powers. The treaty of peace with Great Britain named them all\\nand acknowledged them \"to be free, sovereign, and independent states.\"\\nThe Articles of Confederation very explicitly declared that \"each state\\nretains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence.\" The Constitution\\nwas a \"league of nations\" formed by an alliance of thirteen separate\\npowers, each one of which ratified the instrument before it was put into\\neffect. They voluntarily entered the union under the Constitution and\\nvoluntarily they could leave it. Such was the constitutional doctrine of\\nHayne, Calhoun, and Jefferson Davis. In seceding, the Southern states\\nhad only to follow legal methods, and the transaction would be correct\\nin every particular. So conventions were summoned, elections were held,\\nand \"sovereign assemblies of the people\" set aside the Constitution in\\nthe same manner as it had been ratified nearly four score years before.\\nThus, said the Southern people, the moral judgment was fulfilled and the\\nletter of the law carried into effect.\\n\\n[Illustration: JEFFERSON DAVIS]\\n\\n=The Formation of the Confederacy.=--Acting on the call of Mississippi,\\na congress of delegates from the seceded states met at Montgomery,\\nAlabama, and on February 8, 1861, adopted a temporary plan of union. It\\nselected, as provisional president, Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, a\\nman well fitted by experience and moderation for leadership, a graduate\\nof West Point, who had rendered distinguished service on the field of\\nbattle in the Mexican War, in public office, and as a member of\\nCongress.\\n\\nIn March, a permanent constitution of the Confederate states was\\ndrafted. It was quickly ratified by the states; elections were held in\\nNovember; and the government under it went into effect the next year.\\nThis new constitution, in form, was very much like the famous instrument\\ndrafted at Philadelphia in 1787. It provided for a President, a Senate,\\nand a House of Representatives along almost identical lines. In the\\npowers conferred upon them, however, there were striking differences.\\nThe right to appropriate money for internal improvements was expressly\\nwithheld; bounties were not to be granted from the treasury nor import\\nduties so laid as to promote or foster any branch of industry. The\\ndignity of the state, if any might be bold enough to question it, was\\nsafeguarded in the opening line by the declaration that each acted \"in\\nits sovereign and independent character\" in forming the Southern union.\\n\\n=Financing the Confederacy.=--No government ever set out upon its career\\nwith more perplexing tasks in front of it. The North had a monetary\\nsystem; the South had to create one. The North had a scheme of taxation\\nthat produced large revenues from numerous sources; the South had to\\nformulate and carry out a financial plan. Like the North, the\\nConfederacy expected to secure a large revenue from customs duties,\\neasily collected and little felt among the masses. To this expectation\\nthe blockade of Southern ports inaugurated by Lincoln in April, 1861,\\nsoon put an end. Following the precedent set by Congress under the\\nArticles of Confederation, the Southern Congress resorted to a direct\\nproperty tax apportioned among the states, only to meet the failure that\\nmight have been foretold.\\n\\nThe Confederacy also sold bonds, the first issue bringing into the\\ntreasury nearly all the specie available in the Southern banks. This\\nspecie by unhappy management was early sent abroad to pay for supplies,\\nsapping the foundations of a sound currency system. Large amounts of\\nbonds were sold overseas, commanding at first better terms than those\\nof the North in the markets of London, Paris, and Amsterdam, many an\\nEnglish lord and statesman buying with enthusiasm and confidence to\\nlament within a few years the proofs of his folly. The difficulties of\\nbringing through the blockade any supplies purchased by foreign bond\\nissues, however, nullified the effect of foreign credit and forced the\\nConfederacy back upon the device of paper money. In all approximately\\none billion dollars streamed from the printing presses, to fall in value\\nat an alarming rate, reaching in January, 1863, the astounding figure of\\nfifty dollars in paper money for one in gold. Every known device was\\nused to prevent its depreciation, without result. To the issues of the\\nConfederate Congress were added untold millions poured out by the states\\nand by private banks.\\n\\n=Human and Material Resources.=--When we measure strength for strength\\nin those signs of power--men, money, and supplies--it is difficult to\\nsee how the South was able to embark on secession and war with such\\nconfidence in the outcome. In the Confederacy at the final reckoning\\nthere were eleven states in all, to be pitted against twenty-two; a\\npopulation of nine millions, nearly one-half servile, to be pitted\\nagainst twenty-two millions; a land without great industries to produce\\nwar supplies and without vast capital to furnish war finances, joined in\\nbattle with a nation already industrial and fortified by property worth\\neleven billion dollars. Even after the Confederate Congress authorized\\nconscription in 1862, Southern man power, measured in numbers, was\\nwholly inadequate to uphold the independence which had been declared.\\nHow, therefore, could the Confederacy hope to sustain itself against\\n\\nsuch a combination of men, money, and materials as the North could\\nmarshal?\\n\\n=Southern Expectations.=--The answer to this question is to be found in\\nthe ideas that prevailed among Southern leaders. First of all, they\\nhoped, in vain, to carry the Confederacy up to the Ohio River; and, with\\nthe aid of Missouri, to gain possession of the Mississippi Valley, the\\ngranary of the nation. In the second place, they reckoned upon a large\\nand continuous trade with Great Britain--the exchange of cotton for war\\nmaterials. They likewise expected to receive recognition and open aid\\nfrom European powers that looked with satisfaction upon the breakup of\\nthe great American republic. In the third place, they believed that\\ntheir control over several staples so essential to Northern industry\\nwould enable them to bring on an industrial crisis in the manufacturing\\nstates. \"I firmly believe,\" wrote Senator Hammond, of South Carolina, in\\n1860, \"that the slave-holding South is now the controlling power of the\\nworld; that no other power would face us in hostility. Cotton, rice,\\ntobacco, and naval stores command the world; and we have the sense to\\nknow it and are sufficiently Teutonic to carry it out successfully. The\\nNorth without us would be a motherless calf, bleating about, and die of\\nmange and starvation.\"\\n\\nThere were other grounds for confidence. Having seized all of the\\nfederal military and naval supplies in the South, and having left the\\nnational government weak in armed power during their possession of the\\npresidency, Southern leaders looked to a swift war, if it came at all,\\nto put the finishing stroke to independence. \"The greasy mechanics of\\nthe North,\" it was repeatedly said, \"will not fight.\" As to disparity in\\nnumbers they drew historic parallels. \"Our fathers, a mere handful,\\novercame the enormous power of Great Britain,\" a saying of ex-President\\nTyler, ran current to reassure the doubtful. Finally, and this point\\ncannot be too strongly emphasized, the South expected to see a weakened\\nand divided North. It knew that the abolitionists and the Southern\\nsympathizers were ready to let the Confederate states go in peace; that\\nLincoln represented only a little more than one-third the voters of the\\ncountry; and that the vote for Douglas, Bell, and Breckinridge meant a\\ndecided opposition to the Republicans and their policies.\\n\\n=Efforts at Compromise.=--Republican leaders, on reviewing the same\\nfacts, were themselves uncertain as to the outcome of a civil war and\\nmade many efforts to avoid a crisis. Thurlow Weed, an Albany journalist\\nand politician who had done much to carry New York for Lincoln, proposed\\na plan for extending the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific.\\nJefferson Davis, warning his followers that a war if it came would be\\nterrible, was prepared to accept the offer; but Lincoln, remembering his\\ncampaign pledges, stood firm as a rock against it. His followers in\\nCongress took the same position with regard to a similar settlement\\nsuggested by Senator Crittenden of Kentucky.\\n\\nThough unwilling to surrender his solemn promises respecting slavery in\\nthe territories, Lincoln was prepared to give to Southern leaders a\\nstrong guarantee that his administration would not interfere directly or\\nindirectly with slavery in the states. Anxious to reassure the South on\\nthis point, the Republicans in Congress proposed to write into the\\nConstitution a declaration that no amendment should ever be made\\nauthorizing the abolition of or interference with slavery in any state.\\nThe resolution, duly passed, was sent forth on March 4, 1861, with the\\napproval of Lincoln; it was actually ratified by three states before the\\nstorm of war destroyed it. By the irony of fate the thirteenth amendment\\nwas to abolish, not guarantee, slavery.\\n\\n\\nTHE WAR MEASURES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\\n\\n=Raising the Armies.=--The crisis at Fort Sumter, on April 12-14, 1861,\\nforced the President and Congress to turn from negotiations to problems\\nof warfare. Little did they realize the magnitude of the task before\\nthem. Lincoln\\'s first call for volunteers, issued on April 15, 1861,\\nlimited the number to 75,000, put their term of service at three months,\\nand prescribed their duty as the enforcement of the law against\\ncombinations too powerful to be overcome by ordinary judicial process.\\nDisillusionment swiftly followed. The terrible defeat of the Federals at\\nBull Run on July 21 revealed the serious character of the task before\\nthem; and by a series of measures Congress put the entire man power of\\nthe country at the President\\'s command. Under these acts, he issued new\\ncalls for volunteers. Early in August, 1862, he ordered a draft of\\nmilitiamen numbering 300,000 for nine months\\' service. The results were\\ndisappointing--ominous--for only about 87,000 soldiers were added to the\\narmy. Something more drastic was clearly necessary.\\n\\nIn March, 1863, Lincoln signed the inevitable draft law; it enrolled in\\nthe national forces liable to military duty all able-bodied male\\ncitizens and persons of foreign birth who had declared their intention\\nto become citizens, between the ages of twenty and forty-five\\nyears--with exemptions on grounds of physical weakness and dependency.\\nFrom the men enrolled were drawn by lot those destined to active\\nservice. Unhappily the measure struck a mortal blow at the principle of\\nuniversal liability by excusing any person who found a substitute for\\nhimself or paid into the war office a sum, not exceeding three hundred\\ndollars, to be fixed by general order. This provision, so crass and so\\nobviously favoring the well-to-do, sowed seeds of bitterness which\\nsprang up a hundredfold in the North.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE DRAFT RIOTS IN NEW YORK CITY]\\n\\nThe beginning of the drawings under the draft act in New York City, on\\nMonday, July 13, 1863, was the signal for four days of rioting. In the\\ncourse of this uprising, draft headquarters were destroyed; the office\\nof the _Tribune_ was gutted; negroes were seized, hanged, and shot; the\\nhomes of obnoxious Unionists were burned down; the residence of the\\nmayor of the city was attacked; and regular battles were fought in the\\nstreets between the rioters and the police. Business stopped and a large\\npart of the city passed absolutely into the control of the mob. Not\\nuntil late the following Wednesday did enough troops arrive to restore\\norder and enable the residents of the city to resume their daily\\nactivities. At least a thousand people had been killed or wounded and\\nmore than a million dollars\\' worth of damage done to property. The draft\\ntemporarily interrupted by this outbreak was then resumed and carried\\nout without further trouble.\\n\\nThe results of the draft were in the end distinctly disappointing to the\\ngovernment. The exemptions were numerous and the number who preferred\\nand were able to pay $300 rather than serve exceeded all expectations.\\nVolunteering, it is true, was stimulated, but even that resource could\\nhardly keep the thinning ranks of the army filled. With reluctance\\nCongress struck out the $300 exemption clause, but still favored the\\nwell-to-do by allowing them to hire substitutes if they could find them.\\nWith all this power in its hands the administration was able by January,\\n1865, to construct a union army that outnumbered the Confederates two to\\none.\\n\\n=War Finance.=--In the financial sphere the North faced immense\\ndifficulties. The surplus in the treasury had been dissipated by 1861\\nand the tariff of 1857 had failed to produce an income sufficient to\\nmeet the ordinary expenses of the government. Confronted by military and\\nnaval expenditures of appalling magnitude, rising from $35,000,000 in\\nthe first year of the war to $1,153,000,000 in the last year, the\\nadministration had to tap every available source of income. The duties\\non imports were increased, not once but many times, producing huge\\nrevenues and also meeting the most extravagant demands of the\\nmanufacturers for protection. Direct taxes were imposed on the states\\naccording to their respective populations, but the returns were\\nmeager--all out of proportion to the irritation involved. Stamp taxes\\nand taxes on luxuries, occupations, and the earnings of corporations\\nwere laid with a weight that, in ordinary times, would have drawn forth\\nopposition of ominous strength. The whole gamut of taxation was run.\\nEven a tax on incomes and gains by the year, the first in the history of\\nthe federal government, was included in the long list.\\n\\nRevenues were supplemented by bond issues, mounting in size and interest\\nrate, until in October, at the end of the war, the debt stood at\\n$2,208,000,000. The total cost of the war was many times the money value\\nof all the slaves in the Southern states. To the debt must be added\\nnearly half a billion dollars in \"greenbacks\"--paper money issued by\\nCongress in desperation as bond sales and revenues from taxes failed to\\nmeet the rising expenditures. This currency issued at par on\\nquestionable warrant from the Constitution, like all such paper, quickly\\nbegan to decline until in the worst fortunes of 1864 one dollar in gold\\nwas worth nearly three in greenbacks.\\n\\n=The Blockade of Southern Ports.=--Four days after his call for\\nvolunteers, April 19, 1861, President Lincoln issued a proclamation\\nblockading the ports of the Southern Confederacy. Later the blockade was\\nextended to Virginia and North Carolina, as they withdrew from the\\nunion. Vessels attempting to enter or leave these ports, if they\\ndisregarded the warnings of a blockading ship, were to be captured and\\nbrought as prizes to the nearest convenient port. To make the order\\neffective, immediate steps were taken to increase the naval forces,\\ndepleted by neglect, until the entire coast line was patrolled with such\\na number of ships that it was a rare captain who ventured to run the\\ngantlet. The collision between the _Merrimac_ and the _Monitor_ in\\nMarch, 1862, sealed the fate of the Confederacy. The exploits of the\\nunion navy are recorded in the falling export of cotton: $202,000,000 in\\n1860; $42,000,000 in 1861; and $4,000,000 in 1862.\\n\\nThe deadly effect of this paralysis of trade upon Southern war power may\\nbe readily imagined. Foreign loans, payable in cotton, could be\\nnegotiated but not paid off. Supplies could be purchased on credit but\\nnot brought through the drag net. With extreme difficulty could the\\nConfederate government secure even paper for the issue of money and\\nbonds. Publishers, in despair at the loss of supplies, were finally\\ndriven to the use of brown wrapping paper and wall paper. As the\\nrailways and rolling stock wore out, it became impossible to renew them\\nfrom England or France. Unable to export their cotton, planters on the\\nseaboard burned it in what were called \"fires of patriotism.\" In their\\nlurid light the fatal weakness of Southern economy stood revealed.\\n\\n[Illustration: A BLOCKADE RUNNER]\\n\\n=Diplomacy.=--The war had not advanced far before the federal government\\nbecame involved in many perplexing problems of diplomacy in Europe. The\\nConfederacy early turned to England and France for financial aid and for\\nrecognition as an independent power. Davis believed that the industrial\\ncrisis created by the cotton blockade would in time literally compel\\nEurope to intervene in order to get this essential staple. The crisis\\ncame as he expected but not the result. Thousands of English textile\\nworkers were thrown out of employment; and yet, while on the point of\\nstarvation, they adopted resolutions favoring the North instead of\\npetitioning their government to aid the South by breaking the blockade.\\n\\nWith the ruling classes it was far otherwise. Napoleon III, the Emperor\\nof the French, was eager to help in disrupting the American republic; if\\nhe could have won England\\'s support, he would have carried out his\\ndesigns. As it turned out he found plenty of sympathy across the Channel\\nbut not open and official cooperation. According to the eminent\\nhistorian, Rhodes, \"four-fifths of the British House of Lords and most\\nmembers of the House of Commons were favorable to the Confederacy and\\nanxious for its triumph.\" Late in 1862 the British ministers, thus\\nsustained, were on the point of recognizing the independence of the\\nConfederacy. Had it not been for their extreme caution, for the constant\\nand harassing criticism by English friends of the United States--like\\nJohn Bright--and for the victories of Vicksburg and Gettysburg, both\\n\\nEngland and France would have doubtless declared the Confederacy to be\\none of the independent powers of the earth.\\n\\n[Illustration: JOHN BRIGHT]\\n\\nWhile stopping short of recognizing its independence, England and France\\ntook several steps that were in favor of the South. In proclaiming\\nneutrality, they early accepted the Confederates as \"belligerents\" and\\naccorded them the rights of people at war--a measure which aroused anger\\nin the North at first but was later admitted to be sound. Otherwise\\nConfederates taken in battle would have been regarded as \"rebels\" or\\n\"traitors\" to be hanged or shot. Napoleon III proposed to Russia in 1861\\na coalition of powers against the North, only to meet a firm refusal.\\nThe next year he suggested intervention to Great Britain, encountering\\nthis time a conditional rejection of his plans. In 1863, not daunted by\\nrebuffs, he offered his services to Lincoln as a mediator, receiving in\\nreply a polite letter declining his proposal and a sharp resolution from\\nCongress suggesting that he attend to his own affairs.\\n\\nIn both England and France the governments pursued a policy of\\nfriendliness to the Confederate agents. The British ministry, with\\nindifference if not connivance, permitted rams and ships to be built in\\nBritish docks and allowed them to escape to play havoc under the\\nConfederate flag with American commerce. One of them, the _Alabama_,\\nbuilt in Liverpool by a British firm and paid for by bonds sold in\\nEngland, ran an extraordinary career and threatened to break the\\nblockade. The course followed by the British government, against the\\nprotests of the American minister in London, was later regretted. By an\\naward of a tribunal of arbitration at Geneva in 1872, Great Britain was\\nrequired to pay the huge sum of $15,500,000 to cover the damages wrought\\nby Confederate cruisers fitted out in England.\\n\\n[Illustration: WILLIAM H. SEWARD]\\n\\nIn all fairness it should be said that the conduct of the North\\ncontributed to the irritation between the two countries. Seward, the\\nSecretary of State, was vindictive in dealing with Great Britain; had it\\nnot been for the moderation of Lincoln, he would have pursued a course\\nverging in the direction of open war. The New York and Boston papers\\nwere severe in their attacks on England. Words were, on one occasion at\\nleast, accompanied by an act savoring of open hostility. In November,\\n1861, Captain Wilkes, commanding a union vessel, overhauled the British\\nsteamer _Trent_, and carried off by force two Confederate agents, Mason\\nand Slidell, sent by President Davis to represent the Confederacy at\\nLondon and Paris respectively. This was a clear violation of the right\\nof merchant vessels to be immune from search and impressment; and, in\\nanswer to the demand of Great Britain for the release of the two men,\\nthe United States conceded that it was in the wrong. It surrendered the\\ntwo Confederate agents to a British vessel for safe conduct abroad, and\\nmade appropriate apologies.\\n\\n=Emancipation.=--Among the extreme war measures adopted by the Northern\\ngovernment must be counted the emancipation of the slaves in the states\\nin arms against the union. This step was early and repeatedly suggested\\nto Lincoln by the abolitionists; but was steadily put aside. He knew\\nthat the abolitionists were a mere handful, that emancipation might\\ndrive the border states into secession, and that the Northern soldiers\\nhad enlisted to save the union. Moreover, he had before him a solemn\\nresolution passed by Congress on July 22, 1861, declaring the sole\\npurpose of the war to be the salvation of the union and disavowing any\\nintention of interfering with slavery.\\n\\nThe federal government, though pledged to the preservation of slavery,\\nsoon found itself beaten back upon its course and out upon a new tack.\\nBefore a year had elapsed, namely on April 10, 1862, Congress resolved\\nthat financial aid should be given to any state that might adopt gradual\\nemancipation. Six days later it abolished slavery in the District of\\nColumbia. Two short months elapsed. On June 19, 1862, it swept slavery\\nforever from the territories of the United States. Chief Justice Taney\\nstill lived, the Dred Scott decision stood as written in the book, but\\nthe Constitution had been re-read in the light of the Civil War. The\\ndrift of public sentiment in the North was being revealed.\\n\\nWhile these measures were pending in Congress, Lincoln was slowly making\\nup his mind. By July of that year he had come to his great decision.\\nNear the end of that month he read to his cabinet the draft of a\\nproclamation of emancipation; but he laid it aside until a military\\nachievement would make it something more than an idle gesture. In\\nSeptember, the severe check administered to Lee at Antietam seemed to\\noffer the golden opportunity. On the 22d, the immortal document was\\ngiven to the world announcing that, unless the states in arms returned\\nto the union by January 1, 1863, the fatal blow at their \"peculiar\\ninstitution\" would be delivered. Southern leaders treated it with slight\\nregard, and so on the date set the promise was fulfilled. The\\nproclamation was issued as a war measure, adopted by the President as\\ncommander-in-chief of the armed forces, on grounds of military\\nnecessity. It did not abolish slavery. It simply emancipated slaves in\\nplaces then in arms against federal authority. Everywhere else slavery,\\nas far as the Proclamation was concerned, remained lawful.\\n\\n[Illustration: ABRAHAM LINCOLN]\\n\\nTo seal forever the proclamation of emancipation, and to extend freedom\\nto the whole country, Congress, in January, 1865, on the urgent\\nrecommendation of Lincoln, transmitted to the states the thirteenth\\namendment, abolishing slavery throughout the United States. By the end\\nof 1865 the amendment was ratified. The house was not divided against\\nitself; it did not fall; it was all free.\\n\\n=The Restraint of Civil Liberty.=--As in all great wars, particularly\\nthose in the nature of a civil strife, it was found necessary to use\\nstrong measures to sustain opinion favorable to the administration\\'s\\nmilitary policies and to frustrate the designs of those who sought to\\nhamper its action. Within two weeks of his first call for volunteers,\\nLincoln empowered General Scott to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_\\nalong the line of march between Philadelphia and Washington and thus to\\narrest and hold without interference from civil courts any one whom he\\ndeemed a menace to the union. At a later date the area thus ruled by\\nmilitary officers was extended by executive proclamation. By an act of\\nMarch 3, 1863, Congress, desiring to lay all doubts about the\\nPresident\\'s power, authorized him to suspend the writ throughout the\\nUnited States or in any part thereof. It also freed military officers\\nfrom the necessity of surrendering to civil courts persons arrested\\nunder their orders, or even making answers to writs issued from such\\ncourts. In the autumn of that year the President, acting under the terms\\nof this law, declared this ancient and honorable instrument for the\\nprotection of civil liberties, the _habeas corpus_, suspended throughout\\nthe length and breadth of the land. The power of the government was also\\nstrengthened by an act defining and punishing certain conspiracies,\\npassed on July 31, 1861--a measure which imposed heavy penalties on\\nthose who by force, intimidation, or threat interfered with the\\nexecution of the law.\\n\\nThus doubly armed, the military authorities spared no one suspected of\\nactive sympathy with the Southern cause. Editors were arrested and\\nimprisoned, their papers suspended, and their newsboys locked up. Those\\nwho organized \"peace meetings\" soon found themselves in the toils of the\\nlaw. Members of the Maryland legislature, the mayor of Baltimore, and\\nlocal editors suspected of entertaining secessionist opinions, were\\nimprisoned on military orders although charged with no offense, and were\\ndenied the privilege of examination before a civil magistrate. A Vermont\\nfarmer, too outspoken in his criticism of the government, found himself\\nbehind the bars until the government, in its good pleasure, saw fit to\\nrelease him. These measures were not confined to the theater of war nor\\nto the border states where the spirit of secession was strong enough to\\nendanger the cause of union. They were applied all through the Northern\\nstates up to the very boundaries of Canada. Zeal for the national cause,\\ntoo often supplemented by a zeal for persecution, spread terror among\\nthose who wavered in the singleness of their devotion to the union.\\n\\nThese drastic operations on the part of military authorities, so foreign\\nto the normal course of civilized life, naturally aroused intense and\\nbitter hostility. Meetings of protest were held throughout the country.\\nThirty-six members of the House of Representatives sought to put on\\nrecord their condemnation of the suspension of the _habeas corpus_ act,\\nonly to meet a firm denial by the supporters of the act. Chief Justice\\nTaney, before whom the case of a man arrested under the President\\'s\\nmilitary authority was brought, emphatically declared, in a long and\\nlearned opinion bristling with historical examples, that the President\\nhad no power to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_. In Congress and\\nout, Democrats, abolitionists, and champions of civil liberty denounced\\nLincoln and his Cabinet in unsparing terms. Vallandigham, a Democratic\\nleader of Ohio, afterward banished to the South for his opposition to\\nthe war, constantly applied to Lincoln the epithet of \"Caesar.\" Wendell\\nPhillips saw in him \"a more unlimited despot than the world knows this\\nside of China.\"\\n\\nSensitive to such stinging thrusts and no friend of wanton persecution,\\nLincoln attempted to mitigate the rigors of the law by paroling many\\npolitical prisoners. The general policy, however, he defended in homely\\nlanguage, very different in tone and meaning from the involved reasoning\\nof the lawyers. \"Must I shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who deserts,\\nwhile I must not touch a hair of the wily agitator who induces him to\\ndesert?\" he asked in a quiet way of some spokesmen for those who\\nprotested against arresting people for \"talking against the war.\" This\\nsummed up his philosophy. He was engaged in a war to save the union, and\\nall measures necessary and proper to accomplish that purpose were\\nwarranted by the Constitution which he had sworn to uphold.\\n\\n=Military Strategy--North and South.=--The broad outlines of military\\nstrategy followed by the commanders of the opposing forces are clear\\neven to the layman who cannot be expected to master the details of a\\ncampaign or, for that matter, the maneuvers of a single great battle.\\nThe problem for the South was one of defense mainly, though even for\\ndefense swift and paralyzing strokes at the North were later deemed\\nimperative measures. The problem of the North was, to put it baldly, one\\nof invasion and conquest. Southern territory had to be invaded and\\nSouthern armies beaten on their own ground or worn down to exhaustion\\nthere.\\n\\nIn the execution of this undertaking, geography, as usual, played a\\nsignificant part in the disposition of forces. The Appalachian ranges,\\nstretching through the Confederacy to Northern Alabama, divided the\\ncampaigns into Eastern and Western enterprises. Both were of signal\\nimportance. Victory in the East promised the capture of the Confederate\\ncapital of Richmond, a stroke of moral worth, hardly to be\\noverestimated. Victory in the West meant severing the Confederacy and\\nopening the Mississippi Valley down to the Gulf.\\n\\nAs it turned out, the Western forces accomplished their task first,\\nvindicating the military powers of union soldiers and shaking the\\nconfidence of opposing commanders. In February, 1862, Grant captured\\nFort Donelson on the Tennessee River, rallied wavering unionists in\\nKentucky, forced the evacuation of Nashville, and opened the way for two\\nhundred miles into the Confederacy. At Shiloh, Murfreesboro, Vicksburg,\\nChickamauga, Chattanooga, desperate fighting followed and, in spite of\\nvarying fortunes, it resulted in the discomfiture and retirement of\\nConfederate forces to the Southeast into Georgia. By the middle of 1863,\\nthe Mississippi Valley was open to the Gulf, the initiative taken out of\\nthe hands of Southern commanders in the West, and the way prepared for\\nSherman\\'s final stroke--the march from Atlanta to the sea--a maneuver\\nexecuted with needless severity in the autumn of 1864.\\n\\n[Illustration: GENERAL ULYSSES S. GRANT]\\n\\n[Illustration: GENERAL ROBERT E. LEE]\\n\\nFor the almost unbroken succession of achievements in the West by\\nGenerals Grant, Sherman, Thomas, and Hooker against Albert Sidney\\nJohnston, Bragg, Pemberton, and Hood, the union forces in the East\\noffered at first an almost equally unbroken series of misfortunes and\\ndisasters. Far from capturing Richmond, they had been thrown on the\\ndefensive. General after general--McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker, and\\nMeade--was tried and found wanting. None of them could administer a\\ncrushing defeat to the Confederate troops and more than once the union\\nsoldiers were beaten in a fair battle. They did succeed, however, in\\ndelivering a severe check to advancing Confederates under General Robert\\nE. Lee, first at Antietam in September, 1862, and then at Gettysburg in\\nJuly, 1863--checks reckoned as victories though in each instance the\\nConfederates escaped without demoralization. Not until the beginning of\\nthe next year, when General Grant, supplied with almost unlimited men\\nand munitions, began his irresistible hammering at Lee\\'s army, did the\\nfinal phase of the war commence. The pitiless drive told at last.\\nGeneral Lee, on April 9, 1865, seeing the futility of further conflict,\\nsurrendered an army still capable of hard fighting, at Appomattox, not\\nfar from the capital of the Confederacy.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nTHE FEDERAL MILITARY HOSPITAL AT GETTYSBURG]\\n\\n=Abraham Lincoln.=--The services of Lincoln to the cause of union defy\\ndescription. A judicial scrutiny of the war reveals his thought and\\nplanning in every part of the varied activity that finally crowned\\nNorthern arms with victory. Is it in the field of diplomacy? Does\\nSeward, the Secretary of State, propose harsh and caustic measures\\nlikely to draw England\\'s sword into the scale? Lincoln counsels\\nmoderation. He takes the irritating message and with his own hand\\nstrikes out, erases, tones down, and interlines, exchanging for words\\nthat sting and burn the language of prudence and caution. Is it a matter\\nof compromise with the South, so often proposed by men on both sides\\nsick of carnage? Lincoln is always ready to listen and turns away only\\nwhen he is invited to surrender principles essential to the safety of\\nthe union. Is it high strategy of war, a question of the general best\\nfitted to win Gettysburg--Hooker, Sedgwick, or Meade? Lincoln goes in\\nperson to the War Department in the dead of night to take counsel with\\nhis Secretary and to make the fateful choice.\\n\\nIs it a complaint from a citizen, deprived, as he believes, of his civil\\nliberties unjustly or in violation of the Constitution? Lincoln is ready\\nto hear it and anxious to afford relief, if warrant can be found for it.\\nIs a mother begging for the life of a son sentenced to be shot as a\\ndeserter? Lincoln hears her petition, and grants it even against the\\nprotests made by his generals in the name of military discipline. Do\\npoliticians sow dissensions in the army and among civilians? Lincoln\\ngrandly waves aside their petty personalities and invites them to think\\nof the greater cause. Is it a question of securing votes to ratify the\\nthirteenth amendment abolishing slavery? Lincoln thinks it not beneath\\nhis dignity to traffic and huckster with politicians over the trifling\\njobs asked in return by the members who hold out against him. Does a New\\nYork newspaper call him an ignorant Western boor? Lincoln\\'s reply is a\\nletter to a mother who has given her all--her sons on the field of\\nbattle--and an address at Gettysburg, both of which will live as long as\\nthe tongue in which they were written. These are tributes not only to\\nhis mastery of the English language but also to his mastery of all those\\nsentiments of sweetness and strength which are the finest flowers of\\nculture.\\n\\nThroughout the entire span of service, however, Lincoln was beset by\\nmerciless critics. The fiery apostles of abolition accused him of\\ncowardice when he delayed the bold stroke at slavery. Anti-war Democrats\\nlashed out at every step he took. Even in his own party he found no\\npeace. Charles Sumner complained: \"Our President is now dictator,\\n_imperator_--whichever you like; but how vain to have the power of a\\ngod and not to use it godlike.\" Leaders among the Republicans sought to\\nput him aside in 1864 and place Chase in his chair. \"I hope we may never\\nhave a worse man,\" was Lincoln\\'s quiet answer.\\n\\nWide were the dissensions in the North during that year and the\\nRepublicans, while selecting Lincoln as their candidate again, cast off\\ntheir old name and chose the simple title of the \"Union party.\"\\nMoreover, they selected a Southern man, Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, to\\nbe associated with him as candidate for Vice President. This combination\\nthe Northern Democrats boldly confronted with a platform declaring that\\n\"after four years of failure to restore the union by the experiment of\\nwar, during which, under the pretence of military necessity or war power\\nhigher than the Constitution, the Constitution itself has been\\ndisregarded in every part and public liberty and private right alike\\ntrodden down ... justice, humanity, liberty, and public welfare demand\\nthat immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities, to the\\nend that peace may be restored on the basis of the federal union of the\\nstates.\" It is true that the Democratic candidate, General McClellan,\\nsought to break the yoke imposed upon him by the platform, saying that\\nhe could not look his old comrades in the face and pronounce their\\nefforts vain; but the party call to the nation to repudiate Lincoln and\\nhis works had gone forth. The response came, giving Lincoln 2,200,000\\nvotes against 1,800,000 for his opponent. The bitter things said about\\nhim during the campaign, he forgot and forgave. When in April, 1865, he\\nwas struck down by the assassin\\'s hand, he above all others in\\nWashington was planning measures of moderation and healing.\\n\\n\\nTHE RESULTS OF THE CIVIL WAR\\n\\nThere is a strong and natural tendency on the part of writers to stress\\nthe dramatic and heroic aspects of war; but the long judgment of history\\nrequires us to include all other significant phases as well. Like every\\ngreat armed conflict, the Civil War outran the purposes of those who\\ntook part in it. Waged over the nature of the union, it made a\\nrevolution in the union, changing public policies and constitutional\\nprinciples and giving a new direction to agriculture and industry.\\n\\n=The Supremacy of the Union.=--First and foremost, the war settled for\\nall time the long dispute as to the nature of the federal system. The\\ndoctrine of state sovereignty was laid to rest. Men might still speak of\\nthe rights of states and think of their commonwealths with affection,\\nbut nullification and secession were destroyed. The nation was supreme.\\n\\n=The Destruction of the Slave Power.=--Next to the vindication of\\nnational supremacy was the destruction of the planting aristocracy of\\nthe South--that great power which had furnished leadership of undoubted\\nability and had so long contested with the industrial and commercial\\ninterests of the North. The first paralyzing blow at the planters was\\nstruck by the abolition of slavery. The second and third came with the\\nfourteenth (1868) and fifteenth (1870) amendments, giving the ballot to\\nfreedmen and excluding from public office the Confederate\\nleaders--driving from the work of reconstruction the finest talents of\\nthe South. As if to add bitterness to gall and wormwood, the fourteenth\\namendment forbade the United States or any state to pay any debts\\nincurred in aid of the Confederacy or in the emancipation of the\\nslaves--plunging into utter bankruptcy the Southern financiers who had\\nstripped their section of capital to support their cause. So the\\nSouthern planters found themselves excluded from public office and ruled\\nover by their former bondmen under the tutelage of Republican leaders.\\nTheir labor system was wrecked and their money and bonds were as\\nworthless as waste paper. The South was subject to the North. That which\\nneither the Federalists nor the Whigs had been able to accomplish in the\\nrealm of statecraft was accomplished on the field of battle.\\n\\n\\n=The Triumph of Industry.=--The wreck of the planting system was\\naccompanied by a mighty upswing of Northern industry which made the old\\nWhigs of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania stare in wonderment. The demands\\nof the federal government for manufactured goods at unrestricted prices\\ngave a stimulus to business which more than replaced the lost markets of\\nthe South. Between 1860 and 1870 the number of manufacturing\\nestablishments increased 79.6 per cent as against 14.2 for the previous\\ndecade; while the number of persons employed almost doubled. There was\\nno doubt about the future of American industry.\\n\\n=The Victory for the Protective Tariff.=--Moreover, it was henceforth to\\nbe well protected. For many years before the war the friends of\\nprotection had been on the defensive. The tariff act of 1857 imposed\\nduties so low as to presage a tariff for revenue only. The war changed\\nall that. The extraordinary military expenditures, requiring heavy taxes\\non all sources, justified tariffs so high that a follower of Clay or\\nWebster might well have gasped with astonishment. After the war was over\\nthe debt remained and both interest and principal had to be paid.\\nProtective arguments based on economic reasoning were supported by a\\nplain necessity for revenue which admitted no dispute.\\n\\n=A Liberal Immigration Policy.=--Linked with industry was the labor\\nsupply. The problem of manning industries became a pressing matter, and\\nRepublican leaders grappled with it. In the platform of the Union party\\nadopted in 1864 it was declared \"that foreign immigration, which in the\\npast has added so much to the wealth, the development of resources, and\\nthe increase of power to this nation--the asylum of the oppressed of all\\nnations--should be fostered and encouraged by a liberal and just\\npolicy.\" In that very year Congress, recognizing the importance of the\\nproblem, passed a measure of high significance, creating a bureau of\\nimmigration, and authorizing a modified form of indentured labor, by\\nmaking it legal for immigrants to pledge their wages in advance to pay\\ntheir passage over. Though the bill was soon repealed, the practice\\nauthorized by it was long continued. The cheapness of the passage\\nshortened the term of service; but the principle was older than the\\ndays of William Penn.\\n\\n=The Homestead Act of 1862.=--In the immigration measure guaranteeing a\\ncontinuous and adequate labor supply, the manufacturers saw an offset to\\nthe Homestead Act of 1862 granting free lands to settlers. The Homestead\\nlaw they had resisted in a long and bitter congressional battle.\\nNaturally, they had not taken kindly to a scheme which lured men away\\nfrom the factories or enabled them to make unlimited demands for higher\\nwages as the price of remaining. Southern planters likewise had feared\\nfree homesteads for the very good reason that they only promised to add\\nto the overbalancing power of the North.\\n\\nIn spite of the opposition, supporters of a liberal land policy made\\nsteady gains. Free-soil Democrats,--Jacksonian farmers and\\nmechanics,--labor reformers, and political leaders, like Stephen A.\\nDouglas of Illinois and Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, kept up the\\nagitation in season and out. More than once were they able to force a\\nhomestead bill through the House of Representatives only to have it\\nblocked in the Senate where Southern interests were intrenched. Then,\\nafter the Senate was won over, a Democratic President, James Buchanan,\\nvetoed the bill. Still the issue lived. The Republicans, strong among\\nthe farmers of the Northwest, favored it from the beginning and pressed\\nit upon the attention of the country. Finally the manufacturers yielded;\\nthey received their compensation in the contract labor law. In 1862\\nCongress provided for the free distribution of land in 160-acre lots\\namong men and women of strong arms and willing hearts ready to build\\ntheir serried lines of homesteads to the Rockies and beyond.\\n\\n=Internal Improvements.=--If farmers and manufacturers were early\\ndivided on the matter of free homesteads, the same could hardly be said\\nof internal improvements. The Western tiller of the soil was as eager\\nfor some easy way of sending his produce to market as the manufacturer\\nwas for the same means to transport his goods to the consumer on the\\nfarm. While the Confederate leaders were writing into their\\nconstitution a clause forbidding all appropriations for internal\\nimprovements, the Republican leaders at Washington were planning such\\nexpenditures from the treasury in the form of public land grants to\\nrailways as would have dazed the authors of the national road bill half\\na century earlier.\\n\\n=Sound Finance--National Banking.=--From Hamilton\\'s day to Lincoln\\'s,\\nbusiness men in the East had contended for a sound system of national\\ncurrency. The experience of the states with paper money, painfully\\nimpressive in the years before the framing of the Constitution, had been\\nconvincing to those who understood the economy of business. The\\nConstitution, as we have seen, bore the signs of this experience. States\\nwere forbidden to emit bills of credit: paper money, in short. This\\nprovision stood clear in the document; but judicial ingenuity had\\ncircumvented it in the age of Jacksonian Democracy. The states had\\nenacted and the Supreme Court, after the death of John Marshall, had\\nsustained laws chartering banking companies and authorizing them to\\nissue paper money. So the country was beset by the old curse, the banks\\nof Western and Southern states issuing reams of paper notes to help\\nborrowers pay their debts.\\n\\nIn dealing with war finances, the Republicans attacked this ancient\\nevil. By act of Congress in 1864, they authorized a series of national\\nbanks founded on the credit of government bonds and empowered to issue\\nnotes. The next year they stopped all bank paper sent forth under the\\nauthority of the states by means of a prohibitive tax. In this way, by\\ntwo measures Congress restored federal control over the monetary system\\nalthough it did not reestablish the United States Bank so hated by\\nJacksonian Democracy.\\n\\n=Destruction of States\\' Rights by Fourteenth Amendment.=--These acts and\\nothers not cited here were measures of centralization and consolidation\\nat the expense of the powers and dignity of the states. They were all of\\nhigh import, but the crowning act of nationalism was the fourteenth\\namendment which, among other things, forbade states to \"deprive any\\nperson of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\" The\\nimmediate occasion, though not the actual cause of this provision, was\\nthe need for protecting the rights of freedmen against hostile\\nlegislatures in the South. The result of the amendment, as was\\nprophesied in protests loud and long from every quarter of the\\nDemocratic party, was the subjection of every act of state, municipal,\\nand county authorities to possible annulment by the Supreme Court at\\nWashington. The expected happened.\\n\\nFew negroes ever brought cases under the fourteenth amendment to the\\nattention of the courts; but thousands of state laws, municipal\\nordinances, and acts of local authorities were set aside as null and\\nvoid under it. Laws of states regulating railway rates, fixing hours of\\nlabor in bakeshops, and taxing corporations were in due time to be\\nannulled as conflicting with an amendment erroneously supposed to be\\ndesigned solely for the protection of negroes. As centralized power over\\ntariffs, railways, public lands, and other national concerns went to\\nCongress, so centralized power over the acts of state and local\\nauthorities involving an infringement of personal and property rights\\nwas conferred on the federal judiciary, the apex of which was the\\nSupreme Court at Washington. Thus the old federation of \"independent\\nstates,\" all equal in rights and dignity, each wearing the \"jewel of\\nsovereignty\" so celebrated in Southern oratory, had gone the way of all\\nflesh under the withering blasts of Civil War.\\n\\n\\nRECONSTRUCTION IN THE SOUTH\\n\\n=Theories about the Position of the Seceded States.=--On the morning of\\nApril 9, 1865, when General Lee surrendered his army to General Grant,\\neleven states stood in a peculiar relation to the union now declared\\nperpetual. Lawyers and political philosophers were much perturbed and\\nhad been for some time as to what should be done with the members of the\\nformer Confederacy. Radical Republicans held that they were \"conquered\\nprovinces\" at the mercy of Congress, to be governed under such laws as\\nit saw fit to enact and until in its wisdom it decided to readmit any or\\nall of them to the union. Men of more conservative views held that, as\\nthe war had been waged by the North on the theory that no state could\\nsecede from the union, the Confederate states had merely attempted to\\nwithdraw and had failed. The corollary of this latter line of argument\\nwas simple: \"The Southern states are still in the union and it is the\\nduty of the President, as commander-in-chief, to remove the federal\\ntroops as soon as order is restored and the state governments ready to\\nfunction once more as usual.\"\\n\\n=Lincoln\\'s Proposal.=--Some such simple and conservative form of\\nreconstruction had been suggested by Lincoln in a proclamation of\\nDecember 8, 1863. He proposed pardon and a restoration of property,\\nexcept in slaves, to nearly all who had \"directly or by implication\\nparticipated in the existing rebellion,\" on condition that they take an\\noath of loyalty to the union. He then announced that when, in any of the\\nstates named, a body of voters, qualified under the law as it stood\\nbefore secession and equal in number to one-tenth the votes cast in\\n1860, took the oath of allegiance, they should be permitted to\\nreestablish a state government. Such a government, he added, should be\\nrecognized as a lawful authority and entitled to protection under the\\nfederal Constitution. With reference to the status of the former slaves\\nLincoln made it clear that, while their freedom must be recognized, he\\nwould not object to any legislation \"which may yet be consistent as a\\ntemporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring,\\nlandless, and homeless class.\"\\n\\n=Andrew Johnson\\'s Plan--His Impeachment.=--Lincoln\\'s successor, Andrew\\nJohnson, the Vice President, soon after taking office, proposed to\\npursue a somewhat similar course. In a number of states he appointed\\nmilitary governors, instructing them at the earliest possible moment to\\nassemble conventions, chosen \"by that portion of the people of the said\\nstates who are loyal to the United States,\" and proceed to the\\norganization of regular civil government. Johnson, a Southern man and a\\nDemocrat, was immediately charged by the Republicans with being too\\nready to restore the Southern states. As the months went by, the\\nopposition to his measures and policies in Congress grew in size and\\nbitterness. The contest resulted in the impeachment of Johnson by the\\nHouse of Representatives in March, 1868, and his acquittal by the Senate\\nmerely because his opponents lacked one vote of the two-thirds required\\nfor conviction.\\n\\n=Congress Enacts \"Reconstruction Laws.\"=--In fact, Congress was in a\\nstrategic position. It was the law-making body, and it could, moreover,\\ndetermine the conditions under which Senators and Representatives from\\nthe South were to be readmitted. It therefore proceeded to pass a series\\nof reconstruction acts--carrying all of them over Johnson\\'s veto. These\\nmeasures, the first of which became a law on March 2, 1867, betrayed an\\nanimus not found anywhere in Lincoln\\'s plans or Johnson\\'s proclamations.\\n\\nThey laid off the ten states--the whole Confederacy with the exception\\nof Tennessee--still outside the pale, into five military districts, each\\ncommanded by a military officer appointed by the President. They ordered\\nthe commanding general to prepare a register of voters for the election\\nof delegates to conventions chosen for the purpose of drafting new\\nconstitutions. Such voters, however, were not to be, as Lincoln had\\nsuggested, loyal persons duly qualified under the law existing before\\nsecession but \"the male citizens of said state, twenty-one years old and\\nupward, of whatever race, color, or previous condition, ... except such\\nas may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion or for felony\\nat common law.\" This was the death knell to the idea that the leaders of\\nthe Confederacy and their white supporters might be permitted to share\\nin the establishment of the new order. Power was thus arbitrarily thrust\\ninto the hands of the newly emancipated male negroes and the handful of\\nwhites who could show a record of loyalty. That was not all. Each state\\nwas, under the reconstruction acts, compelled to ratify the fourteenth\\namendment to the federal Constitution as a price of restoration to the\\nunion.\\n\\nThe composition of the conventions thus authorized may be imagined.\\nBondmen without the asking and without preparation found themselves the\\ngoverning power. An army of adventurers from the North, \"carpet baggers\"\\nas they were called, poured in upon the scene to aid in\\n\"reconstruction.\" Undoubtedly many men of honor and fine intentions gave\\nunstinted service, but the results of their deliberations only\\naggravated the open wound left by the war. Any number of political\\ndoctors offered their prescriptions; but no effective remedy could be\\nfound. Under measures admittedly open to grave objections, the Southern\\nstates were one after another restored to the union by the grace of\\nCongress, the last one in 1870. Even this grudging concession of the\\nformalities of statehood did not mean a full restoration of honors and\\nprivileges. The last soldier was not withdrawn from the last Southern\\ncapital until 1877, and federal control over elections long remained as\\na sign of congressional supremacy.\\n\\n=The Status of the Freedmen.=--Even more intricate than the issues\\ninvolved in restoring the seceded states to the union was the question\\nof what to do with the newly emancipated slaves. That problem, often put\\nto abolitionists before the war, had become at last a real concern. The\\nthirteenth amendment abolishing slavery had not touched it at all. It\\ndeclared bondmen free, but did nothing to provide them with work or\\nhomes and did not mention the subject of political rights. All these\\nmatters were left to the states, and the legislatures of some of them,\\nby their famous \"black codes,\" restored a form of servitude under the\\nguise of vagrancy and apprentice laws. Such methods were in fact partly\\nresponsible for the reaction that led Congress to abandon Lincoln\\'s\\npolicies and undertake its own program of reconstruction.\\n\\nStill no extensive effort was made to solve by law the economic problems\\nof the bondmen. Radical abolitionists had advocated that the slaves when\\nemancipated should be given outright the fields of their former\\nmasters; but Congress steadily rejected the very idea of confiscation.\\nThe necessity of immediate assistance it recognized by creating in 1865\\nthe Freedmen\\'s Bureau to take care of refugees. It authorized the issue\\nof food and clothing to the destitute and the renting of abandoned and\\ncertain other lands under federal control to former slaves at reasonable\\nrates. But the larger problem of the relation of the freedmen to the\\nland, it left to the slow working of time.\\n\\nAgainst sharp protests from conservative men, particularly among the\\nDemocrats, Congress did insist, however, on conferring upon the freedmen\\ncertain rights by national law. These rights fell into broad divisions,\\ncivil and political. By an act passed in 1866, Congress gave to former\\nslaves the rights of white citizens in the matter of making contracts,\\ngiving testimony in courts, and purchasing, selling, and leasing\\nproperty. As it was doubtful whether Congress had the power to enact\\nthis law, there was passed and submitted to the states the fourteenth\\namendment which gave citizenship to the freedmen, assured them of the\\nprivileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, and declared\\nthat no state should deprive any person of his life, liberty, or\\nproperty without due process of law. Not yet satisfied, Congress\\nattempted to give social equality to negroes by the second civil rights\\nbill of 1875 which promised to them, among other things, the full and\\nequal enjoyment of inns, theaters, public conveyances, and places of\\namusement--a law later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\\n\\nThe matter of political rights was even more hotly contested; but the\\nradical Republicans, like Charles Sumner, asserted that civil rights\\nwere not secure unless supported by the suffrage. In this same\\nfourteenth amendment they attempted to guarantee the ballot to all negro\\nmen, leaving the women to take care of themselves. The amendment\\ndeclared in effect that when any state deprived adult male citizens of\\nthe right to vote, its representation in Congress should be reduced in\\nthe proportion such persons bore to the voting population.\\n\\nThis provision having failed to accomplish its purpose, the fifteenth\\namendment was passed and ratified, expressly declaring that no citizen\\nshould be deprived of the right to vote \"on account of race, color, or\\nprevious condition of servitude.\" To make assurance doubly secure,\\nCongress enacted in 1870, 1872, and 1873 three drastic laws, sometimes\\nknown as \"force bills,\" providing for the use of federal authorities,\\ncivil and military, in supervising elections in all parts of the Union.\\nSo the federal government, having destroyed chattel slavery, sought by\\nlegal decree to sweep away all its signs and badges, civil, social, and\\npolitical. Never, save perhaps in some of the civil conflicts of Greece\\nor Rome, had there occurred in the affairs of a nation a social\\nrevolution so complete, so drastic, and far-reaching in its results.\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY OF THE SECTIONAL CONFLICT\\n\\nJust as the United States, under the impetus of Western enterprise,\\nrounded out the continental domain, its very existence as a nation was\\nchallenged by a fratricidal conflict between two sections. This storm\\nhad been long gathering upon the horizon. From the very beginning in\\ncolonial times there had been a marked difference between the South and\\nthe North. The former by climate and soil was dedicated to a planting\\nsystem--the cultivation of tobacco, rice, cotton, and sugar cane--and in\\nthe course of time slave labor became the foundation of the system. The\\nNorth, on the other hand, supplemented agriculture by commerce, trade,\\nand manufacturing. Slavery, though lawful, did not flourish there. An\\nabundant supply of free labor kept the Northern wheels turning.\\n\\nThis difference between the two sections, early noted by close\\nobservers, was increased with the advent of the steam engine and the\\nfactory system. Between 1815 and 1860 an industrial revolution took\\nplace in the North. Its signs were gigantic factories, huge aggregations\\nof industrial workers, immense cities, a flourishing commerce, and\\nprosperous banks. Finding an unfavorable reception in the South, the new\\nindustrial system was confined mainly to the North. By canals and\\nrailways New York, Boston, and Philadelphia were linked with the\\nwheatfields of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. A steel net wove North and\\nNorthwest together. A commercial net supplemented it. Western trade was\\ndiverted from New Orleans to the East and Eastern credit sustained\\nWestern enterprise.\\n\\nIn time, the industrial North and the planting South evolved different\\nideas of political policy. The former looked with favor on protective\\ntariffs, ship subsidies, a sound national banking system, and internal\\nimprovements. The farmers of the West demanded that the public domain be\\ndivided up into free homesteads for farmers. The South steadily swung\\naround to the opposite view. Its spokesmen came to regard most of these\\npolicies as injurious to the planting interests.\\n\\nThe economic questions were all involved in a moral issue. The Northern\\nstates, in which slavery was of slight consequence, had early abolished\\nthe institution. In the course of a few years there appeared\\nuncompromising advocates of universal emancipation. Far and wide the\\nagitation spread. The South was thoroughly frightened. It demanded\\nprotection against the agitators, the enforcement of its rights in the\\ncase of runaway slaves, and equal privileges for slavery in the new\\nterritories.\\n\\nWith the passing years the conflict between the two sections increased\\nin bitterness. It flamed up in 1820 and was allayed by the Missouri\\ncompromise. It took on the form of a tariff controversy and\\nnullification in 1832. It appeared again after the Mexican war when the\\nquestion of slavery in the new territories was raised. Again\\ncompromise--the great settlement of 1850--seemed to restore peace, only\\nto prove an illusion. A series of startling events swept the country\\ninto war: the repeal of the Missouri compromise in 1854, the rise of the\\nRepublican party pledged to the prohibition of slavery in the\\nterritories, the Dred Scott decision of 1857, the Lincoln-Douglas\\ndebates, John Brown\\'s raid, the election of Lincoln, and secession.\\n\\nThe Civil War, lasting for four years, tested the strength of both North\\nand South, in leadership, in finance, in diplomatic skill, in material\\nresources, in industry, and in armed forces. By the blockade of Southern\\nports, by an overwhelming weight of men and materials, and by relentless\\nhammering on the field of battle, the North was victorious.\\n\\nThe results of the war were revolutionary in character. Slavery was\\nabolished and the freedmen given the ballot. The Southern planters who\\nhad been the leaders of their section were ruined financially and almost\\nto a man excluded from taking part in political affairs. The union was\\ndeclared to be perpetual and the right of a state to secede settled by\\nthe judgment of battle. Federal control over the affairs of states,\\ncounties, and cities was established by the fourteenth amendment. The\\npower and prestige of the federal government were enhanced beyond\\nimagination. The North was now free to pursue its economic policies: a\\nprotective tariff, a national banking system, land grants for railways,\\nfree lands for farmers. Planting had dominated the country for nearly a\\ngeneration. Business enterprise was to take its place.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nNORTHERN ACCOUNTS\\n\\nJ.K.

NATIONAL GROWTH AND WORLD POLITICS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\nTHE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC EVOLUTION OF THE SOUTH\\n\\n\\nThe outcome of the Civil War in the South was nothing short of a\\nrevolution. The ruling class, the law, and the government of the old\\norder had been subverted. To political chaos was added the havoc wrought\\nin agriculture, business, and transportation by military operations. And\\nas if to fill the cup to the brim, the task of reconstruction was\\ncommitted to political leaders from another section of the country,\\nstrangers to the life and traditions of the South.\\n\\n\\nTHE SOUTH AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR\\n\\n=A Ruling Class Disfranchised.=--As the sovereignty of the planters had\\nbeen the striking feature of the old regime, so their ruin was the\\noutstanding fact of the new. The situation was extraordinary. The\\nAmerican Revolution was carried out by people experienced in the arts of\\nself-government, and at its close they were free to follow the general\\ncourse to which they had long been accustomed. The French Revolution\\nwitnessed the overthrow of the clergy and the nobility; but middle\\nclasses who took their places had been steadily rising in intelligence\\nand wealth.\\n\\nThe Southern Revolution was unlike either of these cataclysms. It was\\nnot brought about by a social upheaval, but by an external crisis. It\\ndid not enfranchise a class that sought and understood power, but\\nbondmen who had played no part in the struggle. Moreover it struck down\\na class equipped to rule. The leading planters were almost to a man\\nexcluded from state and federal offices, and the fourteenth amendment\\nwas a bar to their return. All civil and military places under the\\nauthority of the United States and of the states were closed to every\\nman who had taken an oath to support the Constitution as a member of\\nCongress, as a state legislator, or as a state or federal officer, and\\nafterward engaged in \"insurrection or rebellion,\" or \"given aid and\\ncomfort to the enemies\" of the United States. This sweeping provision,\\nsupplemented by the reconstruction acts, laid under the ban most of the\\ntalent, energy, and spirit of the South.\\n\\n=The Condition of the State Governments.=--The legislative, executive,\\nand judicial branches of the state governments thus passed into the\\ncontrol of former slaves, led principally by Northern adventurers or\\nSouthern novices, known as \"Scalawags.\" The result was a carnival of\\nwaste, folly, and corruption. The \"reconstruction\" assembly of South\\nCarolina bought clocks at $480 apiece and chandeliers at $650. To\\npurchase land for former bondmen the sum of $800,000 was appropriated;\\nand swamps bought at seventy-five cents an acre were sold to the state\\nat five times the cost. In the years between 1868 and 1873, the debt of\\nthe state rose from about $5,800,000 to $24,000,000, and millions of the\\nincrease could not be accounted for by the authorities responsible for\\nit.\\n\\n=Economic Ruin--Urban and Rural.=--No matter where Southern men turned\\nin 1865 they found devastation--in the towns, in the country, and along\\nthe highways. Atlanta, the city to which Sherman applied the torch, lay\\nin ashes; Nashville and Chattanooga had been partially wrecked; Richmond\\nand Augusta had suffered severely from fires. Charleston was described\\nby a visitor as \"a city of ruins, of desolation, of vacant houses, of\\nrotten wharves, of deserted warehouses, of weed gardens, of miles of\\ngrass-grown streets.... How few young men there are, how generally the\\nyoung women are dressed in black! The flower of their proud aristocracy\\nis buried on scores of battle fields.\"\\n\\nThose who journeyed through the country about the same time reported\\ndesolation equally widespread and equally pathetic. An English traveler\\nwho made his way along the course of the Tennessee River in 1870 wrote:\\n\"The trail of war is visible throughout the valley in burnt-up gin\\nhouses, ruined bridges, mills, and factories ... and large tracts of\\nonce cultivated land are stripped of every vestige of fencing. The\\nroads, long neglected, are in disorder and, having in many places become\\nimpassable, new tracks have been made through the woods and fields\\nwithout much respect to boundaries.\" Many a great plantation had been\\nconfiscated by the federal authorities while the owner was in\\nConfederate service. Many more lay in waste. In the wake of the armies\\nthe homes of rich and poor alike, if spared the torch, had been\\ndespoiled of the stock and seeds necessary to renew agriculture.\\n\\n=Railways Dilapidated.=--Transportation was still more demoralized. This\\nis revealed in the pages of congressional reports based upon first-hand\\ninvestigations. One eloquent passage illustrates all the rest. From\\nPocahontas to Decatur, Alabama, a distance of 114 miles, we are told,\\nthe railroad was \"almost entirely destroyed, except the road bed and\\niron rails, and they were in a very bad condition--every bridge and\\ntrestle destroyed, cross-ties rotten, buildings burned, water tanks\\ngone, tracks grown up in weeds and bushes, not a saw mill near the line\\nand the labor system of the country gone. About forty miles of the track\\nwere burned, the cross-ties entirely destroyed, and the rails bent and\\ntwisted in such a manner as to require great labor to straighten and a\\nlarge portion of them requiring renewal.\"\\n\\n=Capital and Credit Destroyed.=--The fluid capital of the South, money\\nand credit, was in the same prostrate condition as the material capital.\\nThe Confederate currency, inflated to the bursting point, had utterly\\ncollapsed and was as worthless as waste paper. The bonds of the\\nConfederate government were equally valueless. Specie had nearly\\ndisappeared from circulation. The fourteenth amendment to the federal\\nConstitution had made all \"debts, obligations, and claims\" incurred in\\naid of the Confederate cause \"illegal and void.\" Millions of dollars\\nowed to Northern creditors before the war were overdue and payment was\\npressed upon the debtors. Where such debts were secured by mortgages on\\nland, executions against the property could be obtained in federal\\ncourts.\\n\\n\\nTHE RESTORATION OF WHITE SUPREMACY\\n\\n=Intimidation.=--In both politics and economics, the process of\\nreconstruction in the South was slow and arduous. The first battle in\\nthe political contest for white supremacy was won outside the halls of\\nlegislatures and the courts of law. It was waged, in the main, by secret\\norganizations, among which the Ku Klux Klan and the White Camelia were\\nthe most prominent. The first of these societies appeared in Tennessee\\nin 1866 and held its first national convention the following year. It\\nwas in origin a social club. According to its announcement, its objects\\nwere \"to protect the weak, the innocent, and the defenceless from the\\nindignities, wrongs, and outrages of the lawless, the violent, and the\\nbrutal; and to succor the suffering, especially the widows and orphans\\nof the Confederate soldiers.\" The whole South was called \"the Empire\"\\nand was ruled by a \"Grand Wizard.\" Each state was a realm and each\\ncounty a province. In the secret orders there were enrolled over half a\\nmillion men.\\n\\nThe methods of the Ku Klux and the White Camelia were similar. Solemn\\nparades of masked men on horses decked in long robes were held,\\nsometimes in the daytime and sometimes at the dead of night. Notices\\nwere sent to obnoxious persons warning them to stop certain practices.\\nIf warning failed, something more convincing was tried. Fright was the\\nemotion most commonly stirred. A horseman, at the witching hour of\\nmidnight, would ride up to the house of some offender, lift his head\\ngear, take off a skull, and hand it to the trembling victim with the\\nrequest that he hold it for a few minutes. Frequently violence was\\nemployed either officially or unofficially by members of the Klan. Tar\\nand feathers were freely applied; the whip was sometimes laid on\\nunmercifully, and occasionally a brutal murder was committed. Often the\\nmembers were fired upon from bushes or behind trees, and swift\\nretaliation followed. So alarming did the clashes become that in 1870\\nCongress forbade interference with electors or going in disguise for the\\npurpose of obstructing the exercise of the rights enjoyed under federal\\nlaw.\\n\\nIn anticipation of such a step on the part of the federal government,\\nthe Ku Klux was officially dissolved by the \"Grand Wizard\" in 1869.\\nNevertheless, the local societies continued their organization and\\nmethods. The spirit survived the national association. \"On the whole,\"\\nsays a Southern writer, \"it is not easy to see what other course was\\nopen to the South.... Armed resistance was out of the question. And yet\\nthere must be some control had of the situation.... If force was denied,\\ncraft was inevitable.\"\\n\\n=The Struggle for the Ballot Box.=--The effects of intimidation were\\nsoon seen at elections. The freedman, into whose inexperienced hand the\\nballot had been thrust, was ordinarily loath to risk his head by the\\nexercise of his new rights. He had not attained them by a long and\\nlaborious contest of his own and he saw no urgent reason why he should\\nbattle for the privilege of using them. The mere show of force, the mere\\nexistence of a threat, deterred thousands of ex-slaves from appearing at\\nthe polls. Thus the whites steadily recovered their dominance. Nothing\\ncould prevent it. Congress enacted force bills establishing federal\\nsupervision of elections and the Northern politicians protested against\\nthe return of former Confederates to practical, if not official, power;\\nbut all such opposition was like resistance to the course of nature.\\n\\n=Amnesty for Southerners.=--The recovery of white supremacy in this way\\nwas quickly felt in national councils. The Democratic party in the North\\nwelcomed it as a sign of its return to power. The more moderate\\nRepublicans, anxious to heal the breach in American unity, sought to\\nencourage rather than to repress it. So it came about that amnesty for\\nConfederates was widely advocated. Yet it must be said that the struggle\\nfor the removal of disabilities was stubborn and bitter. Lincoln, with\\ncharacteristic generosity, in the midst of the war had issued a general\\nproclamation of amnesty to nearly all who had been in arms against the\\nUnion, on condition that they take an oath of loyalty; but Johnson,\\nvindictive toward Southern leaders and determined to make \"treason\\ninfamous,\" had extended the list of exceptions. Congress, even more\\nrelentless in its pursuit of Confederates, pushed through the fourteenth\\namendment which worked the sweeping disabilities we have just described.\\n\\nTo appeals for comprehensive clemency, Congress was at first adamant. In\\nvain did men like Carl Schurz exhort their colleagues to crown their\\nvictory in battle with a noble act of universal pardon and oblivion.\\nCongress would not yield. It would grant amnesty in individual cases;\\nfor the principle of proscription it stood fast. When finally in 1872,\\nseven years after the surrender at Appomattox, it did pass the general\\namnesty bill, it insisted on certain exceptions. Confederates who had\\nbeen members of Congress just before the war, or had served in other\\nhigh posts, civil or military, under the federal government, were still\\nexcluded from important offices. Not until the summer of 1898, when the\\nwar with Spain produced once more a union of hearts, did Congress relent\\nand abolish the last of the disabilities imposed on the Confederates.\\n\\n=The Force Bills Attacked and Nullified.=--The granting of amnesty\\nencouraged the Democrats to redouble their efforts all along the line.\\nIn 1874 they captured the House of Representatives and declared war on\\nthe \"force bills.\" As a Republican Senate blocked immediate repeal, they\\nresorted to an ingenious parliamentary trick. To the appropriation bill\\nfor the support of the army they attached a \"rider,\" or condition, to\\nthe effect that no troops should be used to sustain the Republican\\ngovernment in Louisiana. The Senate rejected the proposal. A deadlock\\nensued and Congress adjourned without making provision for the army.\\nSatisfied with the technical victory, the Democrats let the army bill\\npass the next session, but kept up their fight on the force laws until\\nthey wrung from President Hayes a measure forbidding the use of United\\nStates troops in supervising elections. The following year they again\\nhad recourse to a rider on the army bill and carried it through, putting\\nan end to the use of money for military control of elections. The\\nreconstruction program was clearly going to pieces, and the Supreme\\nCourt helped along the process of dissolution by declaring parts of the\\nlaws invalid. In 1878 the Democrats even won a majority in the Senate\\nand returned to power a large number of men once prominent in the\\nConfederate cause.\\n\\nThe passions of the war by this time were evidently cooling. A new\\ngeneration of men was coming on the scene. The supremacy of the whites\\nin the South, if not yet complete, was at least assured. Federal\\nmarshals, their deputies, and supervisors of elections still possessed\\nauthority over the polls, but their strength had been shorn by the\\nwithdrawal of United States troops. The war on the remaining remnants of\\nthe \"force bills\" lapsed into desultory skirmishing. When in 1894 the\\nlast fragment was swept away, the country took little note of the fact.\\nThe only task that lay before the Southern leaders was to write in the\\nconstitutions of their respective states the provisions of law which\\nwould clinch the gains so far secured and establish white supremacy\\nbeyond the reach of outside intervention.\\n\\n=White Supremacy Sealed by New State Constitutions.=--The impetus to\\nthis final step was given by the rise of the Populist movement in the\\nSouth, which sharply divided the whites and in many communities threw\\nthe balance of power into the hands of the few colored voters who\\nsurvived the process of intimidation. Southern leaders now devised new\\nconstitutions so constructed as to deprive negroes of the ballot by law.\\nMississippi took the lead in 1890; South Carolina followed five years\\nlater; Louisiana, in 1898; North Carolina, in 1900; Alabama and\\nMaryland, in 1901; and Virginia, in 1902.\\n\\nThe authors of these measures made no attempt to conceal their purposes.\\n\"The intelligent white men of the South,\" said Governor Tillman, \"intend\\nto govern here.\" The fifteenth amendment to the federal Constitution,\\nhowever, forbade them to deprive any citizen of the right to vote on\\naccount of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This made\\nnecessary the devices of indirection. They were few, simple, and\\neffective. The first and most easily administered was the ingenious\\nprovision requiring each prospective voter to read a section of the\\nstate constitution or \"understand and explain it\" when read to him by\\nthe election officers. As an alternative, the payment of taxes or the\\nownership of a small amount of property was accepted as a qualification\\nfor voting. Southern leaders, unwilling to disfranchise any of the poor\\nwhite men who had stood side by side with them \"in the dark days of\\nreconstruction,\" also resorted to a famous provision known as \"the\\ngrandfather clause.\" This plan admitted to the suffrage any man who did\\nnot have either property or educational qualifications, provided he had\\nvoted on or before 1867 or was the son or grandson of any such person.\\n\\nThe devices worked effectively. Of the 147,000 negroes in Mississippi\\nabove the age of twenty-one, only about 8600 registered under the\\nconstitution of 1890. Louisiana had 127,000 colored voters enrolled in\\n1896; under the constitution drafted two years later the registration\\nfell to 5300. An analysis of the figures for South Carolina in 1900\\nindicates that only about one negro out of every hundred adult males of\\nthat race took part in elections. Thus was closed this chapter of\\nreconstruction.\\n\\n=The Supreme Court Refuses to Intervene.=--Numerous efforts were made to\\nprevail upon the Supreme Court of the United States to declare such laws\\nunconstitutional; but the Court, usually on technical grounds, avoided\\ncoming to a direct decision on the merits of the matter. In one case\\nthe Court remarked that it could not take charge of and operate the\\nelection machinery of Alabama; it concluded that \"relief from a great\\npolitical wrong, if done as alleged, by the people of a state and by the\\nstate itself, must be given by them, or by the legislative and executive\\ndepartments of the government of the United States.\" Only one of the\\nseveral schemes employed, namely, the \"grandfather clause,\" was held to\\nbe a violation of the federal Constitution. This blow, effected in 1915\\nby the decision in the Oklahoma and Maryland cases, left, however, the\\nmain structure of disfranchisement unimpaired.\\n\\n=Proposals to Reduce Southern Representation in Congress.=--These\\nprovisions excluding thousands of male citizens from the ballot did not,\\nin express terms, deprive any one of the vote on account of race or\\ncolor. They did not, therefore, run counter to the letter of the\\nfifteenth amendment; but they did unquestionably make the states which\\nadopted them liable to the operations of the fourteenth amendment. The\\nlatter very explicitly provides that whenever any state deprives adult\\nmale citizens of the right to vote (except in certain minor cases) the\\nrepresentation of the state in Congress shall be reduced in the\\nproportion which such number of disfranchised citizens bears to the\\nwhole number of male citizens over twenty-one years of age.\\n\\nMindful of this provision, those who protested against disfranchisement\\nin the South turned to the Republican party for relief, asking for\\naction by the political branches of the federal government as the\\nSupreme Court had suggested. The Republicans responded in their platform\\nof 1908 by condemning all devices designed to deprive any one of the\\nballot for reasons of color alone; they demanded the enforcement in\\nletter and spirit of the fourteenth as well as all other amendments.\\nThough victorious in the election, the Republicans refrained from\\nreopening the ancient contest; they made no attempt to reduce Southern\\nrepresentation in the House. Southern leaders, while protesting against\\nthe declarations of their opponents, were able to view them as idle\\nthreats in no way endangering the security of the measures by which\\npolitical reconstruction had been undone.\\n\\n=The Solid South.=--Out of the thirty-year conflict against \"carpet-bag\\nrule\" there emerged what was long known as the \"solid South\"--a South\\nthat, except occasionally in the border states, never gave an electoral\\nvote to a Republican candidate for President. Before the Civil War, the\\nSouthern people had been divided on political questions. Take, for\\nexample, the election of 1860. In all the fifteen slave states the\\nvariety of opinion was marked. In nine of them--Delaware, Virginia,\\nTennessee, Missouri, Maryland, Louisiana, Kentucky, Georgia, and\\nArkansas--the combined vote against the representative of the extreme\\nSouthern point of view, Breckinridge, constituted a safe majority. In\\neach of the six states which were carried by Breckinridge, there was a\\nlarge and powerful minority. In North Carolina Breckinridge\\'s majority\\nover Bell and Douglas was only 849 votes. Equally astounding to those\\nwho imagine the South united in defense of extreme views in 1860 was the\\nvote for Bell, the Unionist candidate, who stood firmly for the\\nConstitution and silence on slavery. In every Southern state Bell\\'s vote\\nwas large. In Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee it was greater\\nthan that received by Breckinridge; in Georgia, it was 42,000 against\\n51,000; in Louisiana, 20,000 against 22,000; in Mississippi, 25,000\\nagainst 40,000.\\n\\nThe effect of the Civil War upon these divisions was immediate and\\ndecisive, save in the border states where thousands of men continued to\\nadhere to the cause of Union. In the Confederacy itself nearly all\\ndissent was silenced by war. Men who had been bitter opponents joined\\nhands in defense of their homes; when the armed conflict was over they\\nremained side by side working against \"Republican misrule and negro\\ndomination.\" By 1890, after Northern supremacy was definitely broken,\\nthey boasted that there were at least twelve Southern states in which no\\nRepublican candidate for President could win a single electoral vote.\\n\\n=Dissent in the Solid South.=--Though every one grew accustomed to speak\\nof the South as \"solid,\" it did not escape close observers that in a\\nnumber of Southern states there appeared from time to time a fairly\\nlarge body of dissenters. In 1892 the Populists made heavy inroads upon\\nthe Democratic ranks. On other occasions, the contests between factions\\nwithin the Democratic party over the nomination of candidates revealed\\nsharp differences of opinion. In some places, moreover, there grew up a\\nRepublican minority of respectable size. For example, in Georgia, Mr.\\nTaft in 1908 polled 41,000 votes against 72,000 for Mr. Bryan; in North\\nCarolina, 114,000 against 136,000; in Tennessee, 118,000 against\\n135,000; in Kentucky, 235,000 against 244,000. In 1920, Senator Harding,\\nthe Republican candidate, broke the record by carrying Tennessee as well\\nas Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Maryland.\\n\\n\\nTHE ECONOMIC ADVANCE OF THE SOUTH\\n\\n=The Break-up of the Great Estates.=--In the dissolution of chattel\\nslavery it was inevitable that the great estate should give way before\\nthe small farm. The plantation was in fact founded on slavery. It was\\ncontinued and expanded by slavery. Before the war the prosperous\\nplanter, either by inclination or necessity, invested his surplus in\\nmore land to add to his original domain. As his slaves increased in\\nnumber, he was forced to increase his acreage or sell them, and he\\nusually preferred the former, especially in the Far South. Still another\\nelement favored the large estate. Slave labor quickly exhausted the soil\\nand of its own force compelled the cutting of the forests and the\\nextension of the area under cultivation. Finally, the planter took a\\nnatural pride in his great estate; it was a sign of his prowess and his\\nsocial prestige.\\n\\nIn 1865 the foundations of the planting system were gone. It was\\ndifficult to get efficient labor to till the vast plantations. The\\nplanters themselves were burdened with debts and handicapped by lack of\\ncapital. Negroes commonly preferred tilling plots of their own, rented\\nor bought under mortgage, to the more irksome wage labor under white\\nsupervision. The land hunger of the white farmer, once checked by the\\nplanting system, reasserted itself. Before these forces the plantation\\nbroke up. The small farm became the unit of cultivation in the South as\\nin the North. Between 1870 and 1900 the number of farms doubled in every\\nstate south of the line of the Potomac and Ohio rivers, except in\\nArkansas and Louisiana. From year to year the process of breaking up\\ncontinued, with all that it implied in the creation of land-owning\\nfarmers.\\n\\n=The Diversification of Crops.=--No less significant was the concurrent\\ndiversification of crops. Under slavery, tobacco, rice, and sugar were\\nstaples and \"cotton was king.\" These were standard crops. The methods of\\ncultivation were simple and easily learned. They tested neither the\\nskill nor the ingenuity of the slaves. As the returns were quick, they\\ndid not call for long-time investments of capital. After slavery was\\nabolished, they still remained the staples, but far-sighted\\nagriculturists saw the dangers of depending upon a few crops. The mild\\nclimate all the way around the coast from Virginia to Texas and the\\ncharacter of the alluvial soil invited the exercise of more imagination.\\nPeaches, oranges, peanuts, and other fruits and vegetables were found to\\ngrow luxuriantly. Refrigeration for steamships and freight cars put the\\nmarkets of great cities at the doors of Southern fruit and vegetable\\ngardeners. The South, which in planting days had relied so heavily upon\\nthe Northwest for its foodstuffs, began to battle for independence.\\nBetween 1880 and the close of the century the value of its farm crops\\nincreased from $660,000,000 to $1,270,000,000.\\n\\n=The Industrial and Commercial Revolution.=--On top of the radical\\nchanges in agriculture came an industrial and commercial revolution. The\\nSouth had long been rich in natural resources, but the slave system had\\nbeen unfavorable to their development. Rivers that would have turned\\nmillions of spindles tumbled unheeded to the seas. Coal and iron beds\\nlay unopened. Timber was largely sacrificed in clearing lands for\\nplanting, or fell to earth in decay. Southern enterprise was consumed in\\nplanting. Slavery kept out the white immigrants who might have supplied\\nthe skilled labor for industry.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nSTEEL MILLS--BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA]\\n\\nAfter 1865, achievement and fortune no longer lay on the land alone. As\\nsoon as the paralysis of the war was over, the South caught the\\nindustrial spirit that had conquered feudal Europe and the agricultural\\nNorth. In the development of mineral wealth, enormous strides were\\ntaken. Iron ore of every quality was found, the chief beds being in\\nVirginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia,\\nAlabama, Arkansas, and Texas. Five important coal basins were uncovered:\\nin Virginia, North Carolina, the Appalachian chain from Maryland to\\nNorthern Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Texas. Oil pools were found\\nin Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas. Within two decades, 1880 to 1900, the\\noutput of mineral wealth multiplied tenfold: from ten millions a year to\\none hundred millions. The iron industries of West Virginia and Alabama\\nbegan to rival those of Pennsylvania. Birmingham became the Pittsburgh\\nand Atlanta the Chicago of the South.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nA SOUTHERN COTTON MILL IN A COTTON FIELD]\\n\\nIn other lines of industry, lumbering and cotton manufacturing took a\\nhigh rank. The development of Southern timber resources was in every\\nrespect remarkable, particularly in Louisiana, Arkansas, and\\nMississippi. At the end of the first decade of the twentieth century,\\nprimacy in lumber had passed from the Great Lakes region to the South.\\nIn 1913 eight Southern states produced nearly four times as much lumber\\nas the Lake states and twice as much as the vast forests of Washington\\nand Oregon.\\n\\nThe development of the cotton industry, in the meantime, was similarly\\nastounding. In 1865 cotton spinning was a negligible matter in the\\nSouthern states. In 1880 they had one-fourth of the mills of the\\ncountry. At the end of the century they had one-half the mills, the two\\nCarolinas taking the lead by consuming more than one-third of their\\nentire cotton crop. Having both the raw materials and the power at hand,\\nthey enjoyed many advantages over the New England rivals, and at the\\nopening of the new century were outstripping the latter in the\\nproportion of spindles annually put into operation. Moreover, the cotton\\nplanters, finding a market at the neighboring mills, began to look\\nforward to a day when they would be somewhat emancipated from absolute\\ndependence upon the cotton exchanges of New York, New Orleans, and\\nLiverpool.\\n\\nTransportation kept pace with industry. In 1860, the South had about ten\\nthousand miles of railway. By 1880 the figure had doubled. During the\\nnext twenty years over thirty thousand miles were added, most of the\\nincrease being in Texas. About 1898 there opened a period of\\nconsolidation in which scores of short lines were united, mainly under\\nthe leadership of Northern capitalists, and new through service opened\\nto the North and West. Thus Southern industries were given easy outlets\\nto the markets of the nation and brought within the main currents of\\nnational business enterprise.\\n\\n=The Social Effects of the Economic Changes.=--As long as the slave\\nsystem lasted and planting was the major interest, the South was bound\\nto be sectional in character. With slavery gone, crops diversified,\\nnatural resources developed, and industries promoted, the social order\\nof the ante-bellum days inevitably dissolved; the South became more and\\nmore assimilated to the system of the North. In this process several\\nlines of development are evident.\\n\\nIn the first place we see the steady rise of the small farmer. Even in\\nthe old days there had been a large class of white yeomen who owned no\\nslaves and tilled the soil with their own hands, but they labored under\\nsevere handicaps. They found the fertile lands of the coast and river\\nvalleys nearly all monopolized by planters, and they were by the force\\nof circumstances driven into the uplands where the soil was thin and the\\ncrops were light. Still they increased in numbers and zealously worked\\ntheir freeholds.\\n\\nThe war proved to be their opportunity. With the break-up of the\\nplantations, they managed to buy land more worthy of their plows. By\\nintelligent labor and intensive cultivation they were able to restore\\nmuch of the worn-out soil to its original fertility. In the meantime\\nthey rose with their prosperity in the social and political scale. It\\nbecame common for the sons of white farmers to enter the professions,\\nwhile their daughters went away to college and prepared for teaching.\\nThus a more democratic tone was given to the white society of the South.\\nMoreover the migration to the North and West, which had formerly carried\\nthousands of energetic sons and daughters to search for new homesteads,\\nwas materially reduced. The energy of the agricultural population went\\ninto rehabilitation.\\n\\nThe increase in the number of independent farmers was accompanied by the\\nrise of small towns and villages which gave diversity to the life of the\\nSouth. Before 1860 it was possible to travel through endless stretches\\nof cotton and tobacco. The social affairs of the planter\\'s family\\ncentered in the homestead even if they were occasionally interrupted by\\ntrips to distant cities or abroad. Carpentry, bricklaying, and\\nblacksmithing were usually done by slaves skilled in simple handicrafts.\\nSupplies were bought wholesale. In this way there was little place in\\nplantation economy for villages and towns with their stores and\\nmechanics.\\n\\nThe abolition of slavery altered this. Small farms spread out where\\nplantations had once stood. The skilled freedmen turned to agriculture\\nrather than to handicrafts; white men of a business or mechanical bent\\nfound an opportunity to serve the needs of their communities. So local\\nmerchants and mechanics became an important element in the social\\nsystem. In the county seats, once dominated by the planters, business\\nand professional men assumed the leadership.\\n\\nAnother vital outcome of this revolution was the transference of a large\\npart of planting enterprise to business. Mr. Bruce, a Southern historian\\nof fine scholarship, has summed up this process in a single telling\\nparagraph: \"The higher planting class that under the old system gave so\\nmuch distinction to rural life has, so far as it has survived at all,\\nbeen concentrated in the cities. The families that in the time of\\nslavery would have been found only in the country are now found, with a\\nfew exceptions, in the towns. The transplantation has been practically\\nuniversal. The talent, the energy, the ambition that formerly sought\\nexpression in the management of great estates and the control of hosts\\nof slaves, now seek a field of action in trade, in manufacturing\\nenterprises, or in the general enterprises of development. This was for\\nthe ruling class of the South the natural outcome of the great economic\\nrevolution that followed the war.\"\\n\\nAs in all other parts of the world, the mechanical revolution was\\nattended by the growth of a population of industrial workers dependent\\nnot upon the soil but upon wages for their livelihood. When Jefferson\\nDavis was inaugurated President of the Southern Confederacy, there were\\napproximately only one hundred thousand persons employed in Southern\\nmanufactures as against more than a million in Northern mills. Fifty\\nyears later, Georgia and Alabama alone had more than one hundred and\\nfifty thousand wage-earners. Necessarily this meant also a material\\nincrease in urban population, although the wide dispersion of cotton\\nspinning among small centers prevented the congestion that had\\naccompanied the rise of the textile industry in New England. In 1910,\\nNew Orleans, Atlanta, Memphis, Nashville, and Houston stood in the same\\nrelation to the New South that Cincinnati, Chicago, Cleveland, and\\nDetroit had stood to the New West fifty years before. The problems of\\nlabor and capital and municipal administration, which the earlier\\nwriters boasted would never perplex the planting South, had come in full\\nforce.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nA GLIMPSE OF MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE]\\n\\n=The Revolution in the Status of the Slaves.=--No part of Southern\\nsociety was so profoundly affected by the Civil War and economic\\nreconstruction as the former slaves. On the day of emancipation, they\\nstood free, but empty-handed, the owners of no tools or property, the\\nmasters of no trade and wholly inexperienced in the arts of self-help\\nthat characterized the whites in general. They had never been accustomed\\nto looking out for themselves. The plantation bell had called them to\\nlabor and released them. Doles of food and clothing had been regularly\\nmade in given quantities. They did not understand wages, ownership,\\nrenting, contracts, mortgages, leases, bills, or accounts.\\n\\nWhen they were emancipated, four courses were open to them. They could\\nflee from the plantation to the nearest town or city, or to the distant\\nNorth, to seek a livelihood. Thousands of them chose this way,\\novercrowding cities where disease mowed them down. They could remain\\nwhere they, were in their cabins and work for daily wages instead of\\nfood, clothing, and shelter. This second course the major portion of\\nthem chose; but, as few masters had cash to dispense, the new relation\\nwas much like the old, in fact. It was still one of barter. The planter\\noffered food, clothing, and shelter; the former slaves gave their labor\\nin return. That was the best that many of them could do.\\n\\nA third course open to freedmen was that of renting from the former\\nmaster, paying him usually with a share of the produce of the land. This\\nway a large number of them chose. It offered them a chance to become\\nland owners in time and it afforded an easier life, the renter being, to\\na certain extent at least, master of his own hours of labor. The final\\nand most difficult path was that to ownership of land. Many a master\\nhelped his former slaves to acquire small holdings by offering easy\\nterms. The more enterprising and the more fortunate who started life as\\nrenters or wage-earners made their way upward to ownership in so many\\ncases that by the end of the century, one-fourth of the colored laborers\\non the land owned the soil they tilled.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the South, though relatively poor, made relatively\\nlarge expenditures for the education of the colored population. By the\\nopening of the twentieth century, facilities were provided for more than\\none-half of the colored children of school age. While in many respects\\nthis progress was disappointing, its significance, to be appreciated,\\nmust be derived from a comparison with the total illiteracy which\\nprevailed under slavery.\\n\\nIn spite of all that happened, however, the status of the negroes in the\\nSouth continued to give a peculiar character to that section of the\\ncountry. They were almost entirely excluded from the exercise of the\\nsuffrage, especially in the Far South. Special rooms were set aside for\\nthem at the railway stations and special cars on the railway lines. In\\nthe field of industry calling for technical skill, it appears, from the\\ncensus figures, that they lost ground between 1890 and 1900--a condition\\nwhich their friends ascribed to discriminations against them in law and\\nin labor organizations and their critics ascribed to their lack of\\naptitude. Whatever may be the truth, the fact remained that at the\\nopening of the twentieth century neither the hopes of the emancipators\\nnor the fears of their opponents were realized. The marks of the\\n\"peculiar institution\" were still largely impressed upon Southern\\nsociety.\\n\\nThe situation, however, was by no means unchanging. On the contrary\\nthere was a decided drift in affairs. For one thing, the proportion of\\nnegroes in the South had slowly declined. By 1900 they were in a\\nmajority in only two states, South Carolina and Mississippi. In\\nArkansas, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina the proportion of\\nthe white population was steadily growing. The colored migration\\nnorthward increased while the westward movement of white farmers which\\ncharacterized pioneer days declined. At the same time a part of the\\nforeign immigration into the United States was diverted southward. As\\nthe years passed these tendencies gained momentum. The already huge\\ncolored quarters in some Northern cities were widely expanded, as whole\\ncounties in the South were stripped of their colored laborers. The race\\nquestion, in its political and economic aspects, became less and less\\nsectional, more and more national. The South was drawn into the main\\nstream of national life. The separatist forces which produced the\\ncataclysm of 1861 sank irresistibly into the background.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nH.W. Grady, _The New South_ (1890).\\n\\nH.A.

The chief goal of this effort was high profits for the\\ncaptains of industry, on the one hand; and high wages for the workers,\\non the other. Its signs, to use the language of a Republican orator in\\n1876, were golden harvest fields, whirling spindles, turning wheels,\\nopen furnace doors, flaming forges, and chimneys filled with eager fire.\\nThe device blazoned on its shield and written over its factory doors was\\n\"prosperity.\" A Republican President was its \"advance agent.\" Released\\nfrom the hampering interference of the Southern planters and the\\nconfusing issues of the slavery controversy, business enterprise sprang\\nforward to the task of winning the entire country. Then it flung its\\noutposts to the uttermost parts of the earth--Europe, Africa, and the\\nOrient--where were to be found markets for American goods and natural\\nresources for American capital to develop.\\n\\n\\nRAILWAYS AND INDUSTRY\\n\\n=The Outward Signs of Enterprise.=--It is difficult to comprehend all\\nthe multitudinous activities of American business energy or to appraise\\nits effects upon the life and destiny of the American people; for beyond\\nthe horizon of the twentieth century lie consequences as yet undreamed\\nof in our poor philosophy. Statisticians attempt to record its\\nachievements in terms of miles of railways built, factories opened, men\\nand women employed, fortunes made, wages paid, cities founded, rivers\\nspanned, boxes, bales, and tons produced. Historians apply standards of\\ncomparison with the past. Against the slow and leisurely stagecoach,\\nthey set the swift express, rushing from New York to San Francisco in\\nless time than Washington consumed in his triumphal tour from Mt. Vernon\\nto New York for his first inaugural. Against the lazy sailing vessel\\ndrifting before a genial breeze, they place the turbine steamer crossing\\nthe Atlantic in five days or the still swifter airplane, in fifteen\\nhours. For the old workshop where a master and a dozen workmen and\\napprentices wrought by hand, they offer the giant factory where ten\\nthousand persons attend the whirling wheels driven by steam. They write\\nof the \"romance of invention\" and the \"captains of industry.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nA CORNER IN THE BETHLEHEM STEEL WORKS]\\n\\n=The Service of the Railway.=--All this is fitting in its way. Figures\\nand contrasts cannot, however, tell the whole story. Take, for example,\\nthe extension of railways. It is easy to relate that there were 30,000\\nmiles in 1860; 166,000 in 1890; and 242,000 in 1910. It is easy to show\\nupon the map how a few straggling lines became a perfect mesh of closely\\nknitted railways; or how, like the tentacles of a great monster, the few\\nroads ending in the Mississippi Valley in 1860 were extended and\\nmultiplied until they tapped every wheat field, mine, and forest beyond\\nthe valley. All this, eloquent of enterprise as it truly is, does not\\nreveal the significance of railways for American life. It does not\\nindicate how railways made a continental market for American goods; nor\\nhow they standardized the whole country, giving to cities on the\\nadvancing frontier the leading features of cities in the old East; nor\\nhow they carried to the pioneer the comforts of civilization; nor yet\\nhow in the West they were the forerunners of civilization, the makers of\\nhomesteads, the builders of states.\\n\\n=Government Aid for Railways.=--Still the story is not ended. The\\nsignificant relation between railways and politics must not be\\noverlooked. The bounty of a lavish government, for example, made\\npossible the work of railway promoters. By the year 1872 the Federal\\ngovernment had granted in aid of railways 155,000,000 acres of land--an\\narea estimated as almost equal to Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut,\\nRhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The\\nUnion Pacific Company alone secured from the federal government a free\\nright of way through the public domain, twenty sections of land with\\neach mile of railway, and a loan up to fifty millions of dollars secured\\nby a second mortgage on the company\\'s property. More than half of the\\nnorthern tier of states lying against Canada from Lake Michigan to the\\nPacific was granted to private companies in aid of railways and wagon\\nroads. About half of New Mexico, Arizona, and California was also given\\noutright to railway companies. These vast grants from the federal\\ngovernment were supplemented by gifts from the states in land and by\\nsubscriptions amounting to more than two hundred million dollars. The\\nhistory of these gifts and their relation to the political leaders that\\nengineered them would alone fill a large and interesting volume.\\n\\n=Railway Fortunes and Capital.=--Out of this gigantic railway promotion,\\nthe first really immense American fortunes were made. Henry Adams, the\\ngrandson of John Quincy Adams, related that his grandfather on his\\nmother\\'s side, Peter Brooks, on his death in 1849, left a fortune of two\\nmillion dollars, \"supposed to be the largest estate in Boston,\" then one\\nof the few centers of great riches. Compared with the opulence that\\nsprang out of the Union Pacific, the Northern Pacific, the Southern\\nPacific, with their subsidiary and component lines, the estate of Peter\\nBrooks was a poor man\\'s heritage.\\n\\nThe capital invested in these railways was enormous beyond the\\nimagination of the men of the stagecoach generation. The total debt of\\nthe United States incurred in the Revolutionary War--a debt which those\\nof little faith thought the country could never pay--was reckoned at a\\nfigure well under $75,000,000. When the Union Pacific Railroad was\\ncompleted, there were outstanding against it $27,000,000 in first\\nmortgage bonds, $27,000,000 in second mortgage bonds held by the\\ngovernment, $10,000,000 in income bonds, $10,000,000 in land grant\\nbonds, and, on top of that huge bonded indebtedness, $36,000,000 in\\nstock--making $110,000,000 in all. If the amount due the United States\\ngovernment be subtracted, still there remained, in private hands, stocks\\nand bonds exceeding in value the whole national debt of Hamilton\\'s\\nday--a debt that strained all the resources of the Federal government in\\n1790. Such was the financial significance of the railways.\\n\\n[Illustration: RAILROADS OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1918]\\n\\n=Growth and Extension of Industry.=--In the field of manufacturing,\\nmining, and metal working, the results of business enterprise far\\noutstripped, if measured in mere dollars, the results of railway\\nconstruction. By the end of the century there were about ten billion\\ndollars invested in factories alone and five million wage-earners\\nemployed in them; while the total value of the output, fourteen billion\\ndollars, was fifteen times the figure for 1860. In the Eastern states\\nindustries multiplied. In the Northwest territory, the old home of\\nJacksonian Democracy, they overtopped agriculture. By the end of the\\ncentury, Ohio had almost reached and Illinois had surpassed\\nMassachusetts in the annual value of manufacturing output.\\n\\nThat was not all. Untold wealth in the form of natural resources was\\ndiscovered in the South and West. Coal deposits were found in the\\nAppalachians stretching from Pennsylvania down to Alabama, in Michigan,\\nin the Mississippi Valley, and in the Western mountains from North\\nDakota to New Mexico. In nearly every coal-bearing region, iron was also\\ndiscovered and the great fields of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota\\nsoon rivaled those of the Appalachian area. Copper, lead, gold, and\\nsilver in fabulous quantities were unearthed by the restless prospectors\\nwho left no plain or mountain fastness unexplored. Petroleum, first\\npumped from the wells of Pennsylvania in the summer of 1859, made new\\nfortunes equaling those of trade, railways, and land speculation. It\\nscattered its riches with an especially lavish hand through Oklahoma,\\nTexas, and California.\\n\\n=The Trust--an Instrument of Industrial Progress.=--Business enterprise,\\nunder the direction of powerful men working single-handed, or of small\\ngroups of men pooling their capital for one or more undertakings, had\\nnot advanced far before there appeared upon the scene still mightier\\nleaders of even greater imagination. New constructive genius now brought\\ntogether and combined under one management hundreds of concerns or\\nthousands of miles of railways, revealing the magic strength of\\ncooperation on a national scale. Price-cutting in oil, threatening ruin\\nto those engaged in the industry, as early as 1879, led a number of\\ncompanies in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia to unite in\\nprice-fixing. Three years later a group of oil interests formed a close\\norganization, placing all their stocks in the hands of trustees, among\\nwhom was John D. Rockefeller. The trustees, in turn, issued\\ncertificates representing the share to which each participant was\\nentitled; and took over the management of the entire business. Such was\\nthe nature of the \"trust,\" which was to play such an unique role in the\\nprogress of America.\\n\\nThe idea of combination was applied in time to iron and steel, copper,\\nlead, sugar, cordage, coal, and other commodities, until in each field\\nthere loomed a giant trust or corporation, controlling, if not most of\\nthe output, at least enough to determine in a large measure the prices\\ncharged to consumers. With the passing years, the railways, mills,\\nmines, and other business concerns were transferred from individual\\nowners to corporations. At the end of the nineteenth century, the whole\\nface of American business was changed. Three-fourths of the output from\\nindustries came from factories under corporate management and only\\none-fourth from individual and partnership undertakings.\\n\\n[Illustration: JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER]\\n\\n=The Banking Corporation.=--Very closely related to the growth of\\nbusiness enterprise on a large scale was the system of banking. In the\\nold days before banks, a person with savings either employed them in his\\nown undertakings, lent them to a neighbor, or hid them away where they\\nset no industry in motion. Even in the early stages of modern business,\\nit was common for a manufacturer to rise from small beginnings by\\nfinancing extensions out of his own earnings and profits. This state of\\naffairs was profoundly altered by the growth of the huge corporations\\nrequiring millions and even billions of capital. The banks, once an\\nadjunct to business, became the leaders in business.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nWALL STREET, NEW YORK CITY]\\n\\nIt was the banks that undertook to sell the stocks and bonds issued by\\nnew corporations and trusts and to supply them with credit to carry on\\ntheir operations. Indeed, many of the great mergers or combinations in\\nbusiness were initiated by magnates in the banking world with millions\\nand billions under their control. Through their connections with one\\nanother, the banks formed a perfect network of agencies gathering up the\\npennies and dollars of the masses as well as the thousands of the rich\\nand pouring them all into the channels of business and manufacturing.\\nIn this growth of banking on a national scale, it was inevitable that a\\nfew great centers, like Wall Street in New York or State Street in\\nBoston, should rise to a position of dominance both in concentrating the\\nsavings and profits of the nation and in financing new as well as old\\ncorporations.\\n\\n=The Significance of the Corporation.=--The corporation, in fact, became\\nthe striking feature of American business life, one of the most\\nmarvelous institutions of all time, comparable in wealth and power and\\nthe number of its servants with kingdoms and states of old. The effect\\nof its rise and growth cannot be summarily estimated; but some special\\nfacts are obvious. It made possible gigantic enterprises once entirely\\nbeyond the reach of any individual, no matter how rich. It eliminated\\nmany of the futile and costly wastes of competition in connection with\\nmanufacture, advertising, and selling. It studied the cheapest methods\\nof production and shut down mills that were poorly equipped or\\ndisadvantageously located. It established laboratories for research in\\nindustry, chemistry, and mechanical inventions. Through the sale of\\nstocks and bonds, it enabled tens of thousands of people to become\\ncapitalists, if only in a small way. The corporation made it possible\\nfor one person to own, for instance, a $50 share in a million dollar\\nbusiness concern--a thing entirely impossible under a regime of\\nindividual owners and partnerships.\\n\\nThere was, of course, another side to the picture. Many of the\\ncorporations sought to become monopolies and to make profits, not by\\neconomies and good management, but by extortion from purchasers.\\nSometimes they mercilessly crushed small business men, their\\ncompetitors, bribed members of legislatures to secure favorable laws,\\nand contributed to the campaign funds of both leading parties. Wherever\\na trust approached the position of a monopoly, it acquired a dominion\\nover the labor market which enabled it to break even the strongest trade\\nunions. In short, the power of the trust in finance, in manufacturing,\\nin politics, and in the field of labor control can hardly be measured.\\n\\n=The Corporation and Labor.=--In the development of the corporation\\nthere was to be observed a distinct severing of the old ties between\\nmaster and workmen, which existed in the days of small industries. For\\nthe personal bond between the owner and the employees was substituted a\\nnew relation. \"In most parts of our country,\" as President Wilson once\\nsaid, \"men work, not for themselves, not as partners in the old way in\\nwhich they used to work, but generally as employees--in a higher or\\nlower grade--of great corporations.\" The owner disappeared from the\\nfactory and in his place came the manager, representing the usually\\ninvisible stockholders and dependent for his success upon his ability to\\nmake profits for the owners. Hence the term \"soulless corporation,\"\\nwhich was to exert such a deep influence on American thinking about\\nindustrial relations.\\n\\n=Cities and Immigration.=--Expressed in terms of human life, this era of\\nunprecedented enterprise meant huge industrial cities and an immense\\nlabor supply, derived mainly from European immigration. Here, too,\\nfigures tell only a part of the story. In Washington\\'s day nine-tenths\\nof the American people were engaged in agriculture and lived in the\\ncountry; in 1890 more than one-third of the population dwelt in towns of\\n2500 and over; in 1920 more than half of the population lived in towns\\nof over 2500. In forty years, between 1860 and 1900, Greater New York\\nhad grown from 1,174,000 to 3,437,000; San Francisco from 56,000 to\\n342,000; Chicago from 109,000 to 1,698,000. The miles of city tenements\\nbegan to rival, in the number of their residents, the farm homesteads of\\nthe West. The time so dreaded by Jefferson had arrived. People were\\n\"piled upon one another in great cities\" and the republic of small\\nfarmers had passed away.\\n\\nTo these industrial centers flowed annually an ever-increasing tide of\\nimmigration, reaching the half million point in 1880; rising to\\nthree-quarters of a million three years later; and passing the million\\nmark in a single year at the opening of the new century. Immigration was\\nas old as America but new elements now entered the situation. In the\\nfirst place, there were radical changes in the nationality of the\\nnewcomers. The migration from Northern Europe--England, Ireland,\\nGermany, and Scandinavia--diminished; that from Italy, Russia, and\\nAustria-Hungary increased, more than three-fourths of the entire number\\ncoming from these three lands between the years 1900 and 1910. These\\nlater immigrants were Italians, Poles, Magyars, Czechs, Slovaks,\\nRussians, and Jews, who came from countries far removed from the\\nlanguage and the traditions of England whence came the founders of\\nAmerica.\\n\\nIn the second place, the reception accorded the newcomers differed from\\nthat given to the immigrants in the early days. By 1890 all the free\\nland was gone. They could not, therefore, be dispersed widely among the\\nnative Americans to assimilate quickly and unconsciously the habits and\\nideas of American life. On the contrary, they were diverted mainly to\\nthe industrial centers. There they crowded--nay, overcrowded--into\\ncolonies of their own where they preserved their languages, their\\nnewspapers, and their old-world customs and views.\\n\\nSo eager were American business men to get an enormous labor supply that\\nthey asked few questions about the effect of this \"alien invasion\" upon\\nthe old America inherited from the fathers. They even stimulated the\\ninvasion artificially by importing huge armies of foreigners under\\ncontract to work in specified mines and mills. There seemed to be no\\nlimit to the factories, forges, refineries, and railways that could be\\nbuilt, to the multitudes that could be employed in conquering a\\ncontinent. As for the future, that was in the hands of Providence!\\n\\n=Business Theories of Politics.=--As the statesmen of Hamilton\\'s school\\nand the planters of Calhoun\\'s had their theories of government and\\npolitics, so the leaders in business enterprise had theirs. It was\\nsimple and easily stated. \"It is the duty of the government,\" they\\nurged, \"to protect American industry against foreign competition by\\nmeans of high tariffs on imported goods, to aid railways by generous\\ngrants of land, to sell mineral and timber lands at low prices to\\nenergetic men ready to develop them, and then to leave the rest to the\\ninitiative and drive of individuals and companies.\" All government\\ninterference with the management, prices, rates, charges, and conduct of\\nprivate business they held to be either wholly pernicious or intolerably\\nimpertinent. Judging from their speeches and writings, they conceived\\nthe nation as a great collection of individuals, companies, and labor\\nunions all struggling for profits or high wages and held together by a\\ngovernment whose principal duty was to keep the peace among them and\\nprotect industry against the foreign manufacturer. Such was the\\npolitical theory of business during the generation that followed the\\nCivil War.\\n\\n\\nTHE SUPREMACY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY (1861-85)\\n\\n=Business Men and Republican Policies.=--Most of the leaders in industry\\ngravitated to the Republican ranks. They worked in the North and the\\nRepublican party was essentially Northern. It was moreover--at least so\\nfar as the majority of its members were concerned--committed to\\nprotective tariffs, a sound monetary and banking system, the promotion\\nof railways and industry by land grants, and the development of internal\\nimprovements. It was furthermore generous in its immigration policy. It\\nproclaimed America to be an asylum for the oppressed of all countries\\nand flung wide the doors for immigrants eager to fill the factories, man\\nthe mines, and settle upon Western lands. In a word the Republicans\\nstood for all those specific measures which favored the enlargement and\\nprosperity of business. At the same time they resisted government\\ninterference with private enterprise. They did not regulate railway\\nrates, prosecute trusts for forming combinations, or prevent railway\\ncompanies from giving lower rates to some shippers than to others. To\\nsum it up, the political theories of the Republican party for three\\ndecades after the Civil War were the theories of American\\nbusiness--prosperous and profitable industries for the owners and \"the\\nfull dinner pail\" for the workmen. Naturally a large portion of those\\nwho flourished under its policies gave their support to it, voted for\\nits candidates, and subscribed to its campaign funds.\\n\\n=Sources of Republican Strength in the North.=--The Republican party was\\nin fact a political organization of singular power. It originated in a\\nwave of moral enthusiasm, having attracted to itself, if not the\\nabolitionists, certainly all those idealists, like James Russell Lowell\\nand George William Curtis, who had opposed slavery when opposition was\\nneither safe nor popular. To moral principles it added practical\\nconsiderations. Business men had confidence in it. Workingmen, who\\nlonged for the independence of the farmer, owed to its indulgent land\\npolicy the opportunity of securing free homesteads in the West. The\\nimmigrant, landing penniless on these shores, as a result of the same\\nbeneficent system, often found himself in a little while with an estate\\nas large as many a baronial domain in the Old World. Under a Republican\\nadministration, the union had been saved. To it the veterans of the war\\ncould turn with confidence for those rewards of service which the\\ngovernment could bestow: pensions surpassing in liberality anything that\\nthe world had ever seen. Under a Republican administration also the\\ngreat debt had been created in the defense of the union, and to the\\nRepublican party every investor in government bonds could look for the\\nfull and honorable discharge of the interest and principal. The spoils\\nsystem, inaugurated by Jacksonian Democracy, in turn placed all the\\nfederal offices in Republican hands, furnishing an army of party workers\\nto be counted on for loyal service in every campaign.\\n\\nOf all these things Republican leaders made full and vigorous use,\\nsometimes ascribing to the party, in accordance with ancient political\\nusage, merits and achievements not wholly its own. Particularly was this\\ntrue in the case of saving the union. \"When in the economy of\\nProvidence, this land was to be purged of human slavery ... the\\nRepublican party came into power,\" ran a declaration in one platform.\\n\"The Republican party suppressed a gigantic rebellion, emancipated four\\nmillion slaves, decreed the equal citizenship of all, and established\\nuniversal suffrage,\" ran another. As for the aid rendered by the\\nmillions of Northern Democrats who stood by the union and the tens of\\nthousands of them who actually fought in the union army, the Republicans\\nin their zeal were inclined to be oblivious. They repeatedly charged the\\nDemocratic party \"with being the same in character and spirit as when it\\nsympathized with treason.\"\\n\\n=Republican Control of the South.=--To the strength enjoyed in the\\nNorth, the Republicans for a long time added the advantages that came\\nfrom control over the former Confederate states where the newly\\nenfranchised negroes, under white leadership, gave a grateful support to\\nthe party responsible for their freedom. In this branch of politics,\\nmotives were so mixed that no historian can hope to appraise them all at\\ntheir proper values. On the one side of the ledger must be set the\\nvigorous efforts of the honest and sincere friends of the freedmen to\\nwin for them complete civil and political equality, wiping out not only\\nslavery but all its badges of misery and servitude. On the same side\\nmust be placed the labor of those who had valiantly fought in forum and\\nfield to save the union and who regarded continued Republican supremacy\\nafter the war as absolutely necessary to prevent the former leaders in\\nsecession from coming back to power. At the same time there were\\nundoubtedly some men of the baser sort who looked on politics as a game\\nand who made use of \"carpet-bagging\" in the South to win the spoils that\\nmight result from it. At all events, both by laws and presidential acts,\\nthe Republicans for many years kept a keen eye upon the maintenance of\\ntheir dominion in the South. Their declaration that neither the law nor\\nits administration should admit any discrimination in respect of\\ncitizens by reason of race, color, or previous condition of servitude\\nappealed to idealists and brought results in elections. Even South\\nCarolina, where reposed the ashes of John C. Calhoun, went Republican in\\n1872 by a vote of three to one!\\n\\nRepublican control was made easy by the force bills described in a\\nprevious chapter--measures which vested the supervision of elections in\\nfederal officers appointed by Republican Presidents. These drastic\\nmeasures, departing from American tradition, the Republican authors\\nurged, were necessary to safeguard the purity of the ballot, not merely\\nin the South where the timid freedman might readily be frightened from\\nusing it; but also in the North, particularly in New York City, where it\\nwas claimed that fraud was regularly practiced by Democratic leaders.\\n\\nThe Democrats, on their side, indignantly denied the charges, replying\\nthat the force bills were nothing but devices created by the Republicans\\nfor the purpose of securing their continued rule through systematic\\ninterference with elections. Even the measures of reconstruction were\\ndeemed by Democratic leaders as thinly veiled schemes to establish\\nRepublican power throughout the country. \"Nor is there the slightest\\ndoubt,\" exclaimed Samuel J. Tilden, spokesman of the Democrats in New\\nYork and candidate for President in 1876, \"that the paramount object and\\nmotive of the Republican party is by these means to secure itself\\nagainst a reaction of opinion adverse to it in our great populous\\nNorthern commonwealths.... When the Republican party resolved to\\nestablish negro supremacy in the ten states in order to gain to itself\\nthe representation of those states in Congress, it had to begin by\\ngoverning the people of those states by the sword.... The next was the\\ncreation of new electoral bodies for those ten states, in which, by\\nexclusions, by disfranchisements and proscriptions, by control over\\nregistration, by applying test oaths ... by intimidation and by every\\nform of influence, three million negroes are made to predominate over\\nfour and a half million whites.\"\\n\\n=The War as a Campaign Issue.=--Even the repeal of force bills could not\\nallay the sectional feelings engendered by the war. The Republicans\\ncould not forgive the men who had so recently been in arms against the\\nunion and insisted on calling them \"traitors\" and \"rebels.\" The\\nSoutherners, smarting under the reconstruction acts, could regard the\\nRepublicans only as political oppressors. The passions of the war had\\nbeen too strong; the distress too deep to be soon forgotten. The\\ngeneration that went through it all remembered it all. For twenty\\nyears, the Republicans, in their speeches and platforms, made \"a\\nstraight appeal to the patriotism of the Northern voters.\" They\\nmaintained that their party, which had saved the union and emancipated\\nthe slaves, was alone worthy of protecting the union and uplifting the\\nfreedmen.\\n\\nThough the Democrats, especially in the North, resented this policy and\\ndubbed it with the expressive but inelegant phrase, \"waving the bloody\\nshirt,\" the Republicans refused to surrender a slogan which made such a\\nready popular appeal. As late as 1884, a leader expressed the hope that\\nthey might \"wring one more President from the bloody shirt.\" They\\nrefused to let the country forget that the Democratic candidate, Grover\\nCleveland, had escaped military service by hiring a substitute; and they\\nmade political capital out of the fact that he had \"insulted the\\nveterans of the Grand Army of the Republic\" by going fishing on\\nDecoration Day.\\n\\n=Three Republican Presidents.=--Fortified by all these elements of\\nstrength, the Republicans held the presidency from 1869 to 1885. The\\nthree Presidents elected in this period, Grant, Hayes, and Garfield, had\\ncertain striking characteristics in common. They were all of origin\\nhumble enough to please the most exacting Jacksonian Democrat. They had\\nbeen generals in the union army. Grant, next to Lincoln, was regarded as\\nthe savior of the Constitution. Hayes and Garfield, though lesser lights\\nin the military firmament, had honorable records duly appreciated by\\nveterans of the war, now thoroughly organized into the Grand Army of the\\nRepublic. It is true that Grant was not a politician and had never voted\\nthe Republican ticket; but this was readily overlooked. Hayes and\\nGarfield on the other hand were loyal party men. The former had served\\nin Congress and for three terms as governor of his state. The latter had\\nlong been a member of the House of Representatives and was Senator-elect\\nwhen he received the nomination for President.\\n\\nAll of them possessed, moreover, another important asset, which was not\\nforgotten by the astute managers who led in selecting candidates. All\\nof them were from Ohio--though Grant had been in Illinois when the\\nsummons to military duties came--and Ohio was a strategic state. It lay\\nbetween the manufacturing East and the agrarian country to the West.\\nHaving growing industries and wool to sell it benefited from the\\nprotective tariff. Yet being mainly agricultural still, it was not\\n\\nwithout sympathy for the farmers who showed low tariff or free trade\\ntendencies. Whatever share the East had in shaping laws and framing\\npolicies, it was clear that the West was to have the candidates. This\\ndivision in privileges--not uncommon in political management--was always\\naccompanied by a judicious selection of the candidate for Vice\\nPresident. With Garfield, for example, was associated a prominent New\\nYork politician, Chester A. Arthur, who, as fate decreed, was destined\\nto more than three years\\' service as chief magistrate, on the\\nassassination of his superior in office.\\n\\n=The Disputed Election of 1876.=--While taking note of the long years of\\nRepublican supremacy, it must be recorded that grave doubts exist in the\\nminds of many historians as to whether one of the three Presidents,\\nHayes, was actually the victor in 1876 or not. His Democratic opponent,\\nSamuel J. Tilden, received a popular plurality of a quarter of a million\\nand had a plausible claim to a majority of the electoral vote. At all\\nevents, four states sent in double returns, one set for Tilden and\\nanother for Hayes; and a deadlock ensued. Both parties vehemently\\nclaimed the election and the passions ran so high that sober men did not\\nshrink from speaking of civil war again. Fortunately, in the end, the\\ncounsels of peace prevailed. Congress provided for an electoral\\ncommission of fifteen men to review the contested returns. The\\nDemocrats, inspired by Tilden\\'s moderation, accepted the judgment in\\nfavor of Hayes even though they were not convinced that he was really\\nentitled to the office.\\n\\n\\nTHE GROWTH OF OPPOSITION TO REPUBLICAN RULE\\n\\n=Abuses in American Political Life.=--During their long tenure of\\noffice, the Republicans could not escape the inevitable consequences of\\npower; that is, evil practices and corrupt conduct on the part of some\\nwho found shelter within the party. For that matter neither did the\\nDemocrats manage to avoid such difficulties in those states and cities\\nwhere they had the majority. In New York City, for instance, the local\\nDemocratic organization, known as Tammany Hall, passed under the sway of\\na group of politicians headed by \"Boss\" Tweed. He plundered the city\\ntreasury until public-spirited citizens, supported by Samuel J. Tilden,\\nthe Democratic leader of the state, rose in revolt, drove the ringleader\\nfrom power, and sent him to jail. In Philadelphia, the local Republican\\nbosses were guilty of offenses as odious as those committed by New York\\npoliticians. Indeed, the decade that followed the Civil War was marred\\nby so many scandals in public life that one acute editor was moved to\\ninquire: \"Are not all the great communities of the Western World growing\\nmore corrupt as they grow in wealth?\"\\n\\nIn the sphere of national politics, where the opportunities were\\ngreater, betrayals of public trust were even more flagrant. One\\nrevelation after another showed officers, high and low, possessed with\\nthe spirit of peculation. Members of Congress, it was found, accepted\\nrailway stock in exchange for votes in favor of land grants and other\\nconcessions to the companies. In the administration as well as the\\nlegislature the disease was rife. Revenue officers permitted whisky\\ndistillers to evade their taxes and received heavy bribes in return. A\\nprobe into the post-office department revealed the malodorous \"star\\nroute frauds\"--the deliberate overpayment of certain mail carriers whose\\nlines were indicated in the official record by asterisks or stars. Even\\ncabinet officers did not escape suspicion, for the trail of the serpent\\nled straight to the door of one of them.\\n\\nIn the lower ranges of official life, the spoils system became more\\nvirulent as the number of federal employees increased. The holders of\\noffices and the seekers after them constituted a veritable political\\narmy. They crowded into Republican councils, for the Republicans, being\\nin power, could alone dispense federal favors. They filled positions in\\nthe party ranging from the lowest township committee to the national\\nconvention. They helped to nominate candidates and draft platforms and\\nelbowed to one side the busy citizen, not conversant with party\\nintrigues, who could only give an occasional day to political matters.\\nEven the Civil Service Act of 1883, wrung from a reluctant Congress two\\nyears after the assassination of Garfield, made little change for a long\\ntime. It took away from the spoilsmen a few thousand government\\npositions, but it formed no check on the practice of rewarding party\\nworkers from the public treasury.\\n\\nOn viewing this state of affairs, many a distinguished citizen became\\nprofoundly discouraged. James Russell Lowell, for example, thought he\\nsaw a steady decline in public morals. In 1865, hearing of Lee\\'s\\nsurrender, he had exclaimed: \"There is something magnificent in having a\\ncountry to love!\" Ten years later, when asked to write an ode for the\\ncentennial at Philadelphia in 1876, he could think only of a biting\\nsatire on the nation:\\n\\n    \"Show your state legislatures; show your Rings;\\n     And challenge Europe to produce such things\\n     As high officials sitting half in sight\\n     To share the plunder and fix things right.\\n     If that don\\'t fetch her, why, you need only\\n     To show your latest style in martyrs,--Tweed:\\n     She\\'ll find it hard to hide her spiteful tears\\n     At such advance in one poor hundred years.\"\\n\\nWhen his critics condemned him for this \"attack upon his native land,\"\\nLowell replied in sadness: \"These fellows have no notion of what love of\\ncountry means. It was in my very blood and bones. If I am not an\\nAmerican who ever was?... What fills me with doubt and dismay is the\\ndegradation of the moral tone. Is it or is it not a result of democracy?\\nIs ours a \\'government of the people, by the people, for the people,\\' or\\na Kakistocracy [a government of the worst], rather for the benefit of\\nknaves at the cost of fools?\"\\n\\n=The Reform Movement in Republican Ranks.=--The sentiments expressed by\\nLowell, himself a Republican and for a time American ambassador to\\nEngland, were shared by many men in his party. Very soon after the close\\nof the Civil War some of them began to protest vigorously against the\\npolicies and conduct of their leaders. In 1872, the dissenters, calling\\nthemselves Liberal Republicans, broke away altogether, nominated a\\ncandidate of their own, Horace Greeley, and put forward a platform\\nindicting the Republican President fiercely enough to please the most\\nuncompromising Democrat. They accused Grant of using \"the powers and\\nopportunities of his high office for the promotion of personal ends.\"\\nThey charged him with retaining \"notoriously corrupt and unworthy men in\\nplaces of power and responsibility.\" They alleged that the Republican\\nparty kept \"alive the passions and resentments of the late civil war to\\nuse them for their own advantages,\" and employed the \"public service of\\nthe government as a machinery of corruption and personal influence.\"\\n\\nIt was not apparent, however, from the ensuing election that any\\nconsiderable number of Republicans accepted the views of the Liberals.\\nGreeley, though indorsed by the Democrats, was utterly routed and died\\nof a broken heart. The lesson of his discomfiture seemed to be that\\nindependent action was futile. So, at least, it was regarded by most men\\nof the rising generation like Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts, and\\nTheodore Roosevelt, of New York. Profiting by the experience of Greeley\\nthey insisted in season and out that reformers who desired to rid the\\nparty of abuses should remain loyal to it and do their work \"on the\\ninside.\"\\n\\n=The Mugwumps and Cleveland Democracy in 1884.=--Though aided by\\nRepublican dissensions, the Democrats were slow in making headway\\nagainst the political current. They were deprived of the energetic and\\ncapable leadership once afforded by the planters, like Calhoun, Davis,\\nand Toombs; they were saddled by their opponents with responsibility for\\nsecession; and they were stripped of the support of the prostrate\\nSouth. Not until the last Southern state was restored to the union, not\\nuntil a general amnesty was wrung from Congress, not until white\\nsupremacy was established at the polls, and the last federal soldier\\nwithdrawn from Southern capitals did they succeed in capturing the\\npresidency.\\n\\nThe opportune moment for them came in 1884 when a number of\\ncircumstances favored their aspirations. The Republicans, leaving the\\nOhio Valley in their search for a candidate, nominated James G. Blaine\\nof Maine, a vigorous and popular leader but a man under fire from the\\nreformers in his own party. The Democrats on their side were able to\\nfind at this juncture an able candidate who had no political enemies in\\nthe sphere of national politics, Grover Cleveland, then governor of New\\nYork and widely celebrated as a man of \"sterling honesty.\" At the same\\ntime a number of dissatisfied Republicans openly espoused the Democratic\\ncause,--among them Carl Schurz, George William Curtis, Henry Ward\\nBeecher, and William Everett, men of fine ideals and undoubted\\nintegrity. Though the \"regular\" Republicans called them \"Mugwumps\" and\\nlaughed at them as the \"men milliners, the dilettanti, and carpet\\nknights of politics,\" they had a following that was not to be despised.\\n\\nThe campaign which took place that year was one of the most savage in\\nAmerican history. Issues were thrust into the background. The tariff,\\nthough mentioned, was not taken seriously. Abuse of the opposition was\\nthe favorite resource of party orators. The Democrats insisted that \"the\\nRepublican party so far as principle is concerned is a reminiscence. In\\npractice it is an organization for enriching those who control its\\nmachinery.\" For the Republican candidate, Blaine, they could hardly find\\nwords to express their contempt. The Republicans retaliated in kind.\\nThey praised their own good works, as of old, in saving the union, and\\ndenounced the \"fraud and violence practiced by the Democracy in the\\nSouthern states.\" Seeing little objectionable in the public record of\\nCleveland as mayor of Buffalo and governor of New York, they attacked\\nhis personal character. Perhaps never in the history of political\\ncampaigns did the discussions on the platform and in the press sink to\\nso low a level. Decent people were sickened. Even hot partisans shrank\\nfrom their own words when, after the election, they had time to reflect\\non their heedless passions. Moreover, nothing was decided by the\\nballoting. Cleveland was elected, but his victory was a narrow one. A\\nchange of a few hundred votes in New York would have sent his opponent\\nto the White House instead.\\n\\n=Changing Political Fortunes (1888-96).=--After the Democrats had\\nsettled down to the enjoyment of their hard-earned victory, President\\nCleveland in his message of 1887 attacked the tariff as \"vicious,\\ninequitable, and illogical\"; as a system of taxation that laid a burden\\nupon \"every consumer in the land for the benefit of our manufacturers.\"\\nBusiness enterprise was thoroughly alarmed. The Republicans\\ncharacterized the tariff message as a free-trade assault upon the\\nindustries of the country. Mainly on that issue they elected in 1888\\nBenjamin Harrison of Indiana, a shrewd lawyer, a reticent politician, a\\ndescendant of the hero of Tippecanoe, and a son of the old Northwest.\\nAccepting the outcome of the election as a vindication of their\\nprinciples, the Republicans, under the leadership of William McKinley in\\nthe House of Representatives, enacted in 1890 a tariff law imposing the\\nhighest duties yet laid in our history. To their utter surprise,\\nhowever, they were instantly informed by the country that their program\\nwas not approved. That very autumn they lost in the congressional\\nelections, and two years later they were decisively beaten in the\\npresidential campaign, Cleveland once more leading his party to victory.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nL.H.

Beyond the Rockies, California, Oregon, and Nevada\\nstood guard, the last of them having been just admitted to furnish\\nanother vote for the fifteenth amendment abolishing slavery. Between the\\nnear and far frontiers lay a vast reach of plain, desert, plateau, and\\nmountain, almost wholly undeveloped. A broad domain, extending from\\nCanada to Mexico, and embracing the regions now included in Washington,\\nIdaho, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, the Dakotas, and\\nOklahoma, had fewer than half a million inhabitants. It was laid out\\ninto territories, each administered under a governor appointed by the\\nPresident and Senate and, as soon as there was the requisite number of\\ninhabitants, a legislature elected by the voters. No railway line\\nstretched across the desert. St. Joseph on the Missouri was the terminus\\nof the Eastern lines. It required twenty-five days for a passenger to\\nmake the overland journey to California by the stagecoach system,\\nestablished in 1858, and more than ten days for the swift pony express,\\norganized in 1860, to carry a letter to San Francisco. Indians still\\nroamed the plain and desert and more than one powerful tribe disputed\\nthe white man\\'s title to the soil.\\n\\n\\nTHE RAILWAYS AS TRAIL BLAZERS\\n\\n=Opening Railways to the Pacific.=--A decade before the Civil War the\\nimportance of rail connection between the East and the Pacific Coast had\\nbeen recognized. Pressure had already been brought to bear on Congress\\nto authorize the construction of a line and to grant land and money in\\nits aid. Both the Democrats and Republicans approved the idea, but it\\nwas involved in the slavery controversy. Indeed it was submerged in it.\\nSouthern statesmen wanted connections between the Gulf and the Pacific\\nthrough Texas, while Northerners stood out for a central route.\\n\\nThe North had its way during the war. Congress, by legislation initiated\\nin 1862, provided for the immediate organization of companies to build a\\nline from the Missouri River to California and made grants of land and\\nloans of money to aid in the enterprise. The Western end, the Central\\nPacific, was laid out under the supervision of Leland Stanford. It was\\nheavily financed by the Mormons of Utah and also by the state\\ngovernment, the ranchmen, miners, and business men of California; and it\\nwas built principally by Chinese labor. The Eastern end, the Union\\nPacific, starting at Omaha, was constructed mainly by veterans of the\\nCivil War and immigrants from Ireland and Germany. In 1869 the two\\ncompanies met near Ogden in Utah and the driving of the last spike,\\nuniting the Atlantic and the Pacific, was the occasion of a great\\ndemonstration.\\n\\nOther lines to the Pacific were projected at the same time; but the\\npanic of 1873 checked railway enterprise for a while. With the revival\\nof prosperity at the end of that decade, construction was renewed with\\nvigor and the year 1883 marked a series of railway triumphs. In February\\ntrains were running from New Orleans through Houston, San Antonio, and\\nYuma to San Francisco, as a result of a union of the Texas Pacific with\\nthe Southern Pacific and its subsidiary corporations. In September the\\nlast spike was driven in the Northern Pacific at Helena, Montana. Lake\\nSuperior was connected with Puget Sound. The waters explored by Joliet\\nand Marquette were joined to the waters plowed by Sir Francis Drake\\nwhile he was searching for a route around the world. That same year also\\na third line was opened to the Pacific by way of the Atchison, Topeka\\nand Santa Fe, making connections through Albuquerque and Needles with\\nSan Francisco. The fondest hopes of railway promoters seemed to be\\nrealized.\\n\\n[Illustration: UNITED STATES IN 1870]\\n\\n=Western Railways Precede Settlement.=--In the Old World and on our\\nAtlantic seaboard, railways followed population and markets. In the Far\\nWest, railways usually preceded the people. Railway builders planned\\ncities on paper before they laid tracks connecting them. They sent\\nmissionaries to spread the gospel of \"Western opportunity\" to people in\\nthe Middle West, in the Eastern cities, and in Southern states. Then\\nthey carried their enthusiastic converts bag and baggage in long trains\\nto the distant Dakotas and still farther afield. So the development of\\nthe Far West was not left to the tedious processes of time. It was\\npushed by men of imagination--adventurers who made a romance of\\nmoney-making and who had dreams of empire unequaled by many kings of the\\npast.\\n\\nThese empire builders bought railway lands in huge tracts; they got more\\nfrom the government; they overcame every obstacle of canon, mountain,\\nand stream with the aid of science; they built cities according to the\\nplans made by the engineers. Having the towns ready and railway and\\nsteamboat connections formed with the rest of the world, they carried\\nout the people to use the railways, the steamships, the houses, and the\\nland. It was in this way that \"the frontier speculator paved the way for\\nthe frontier agriculturalist who had to be near a market before he could\\nfarm.\" The spirit of this imaginative enterprise, which laid out\\nrailways and towns in advance of the people, is seen in an advertisement\\nof that day: \"This extension will run 42 miles from York, northeast\\nthrough the Island Lake country, and will have five good North Dakota\\ntowns. The stations on the line will be well equipped with elevators and\\nwill be constructed and ready for operation at the commencement of the\\ngrain season. Prospective merchants have been active in securing\\ndesirable locations at the different towns on the line. There are still\\nopportunities for hotels, general merchandise, hardware, furniture, and\\ndrug stores, etc.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nA TOWN ON THE PRAIRIE]\\n\\nAmong the railway promoters and builders in the West, James J. Hill,\\nof the Great Northern and allied lines, was one of the most forceful\\nfigures. He knew that tracks and trains were useless without passengers\\nand freight; without a population of farmers and town dwellers. He\\ntherefore organized publicity in the Virginias, Iowa, Ohio, Indiana,\\nIllinois, Wisconsin, and Nebraska especially. He sent out agents to tell\\nthe story of Western opportunity in this vein: \"You see your children\\ncome out of school with no chance to get farms of their own because the\\ncost of land in your older part of the country is so high that you can\\'t\\nafford to buy land to start your sons out in life around you. They have\\nto go to the cities to make a living or become laborers in the mills or\\nhire out as farm hands. There is no future for them there. If you are\\ndoing well where you are and can safeguard the future of your children\\nand see them prosper around you, don\\'t leave here. But if you want\\nindependence, if you are renting your land, if the money-lender is\\ncarrying you along and you are running behind year after year, you can\\ndo no worse by moving.... You farmers talk of free trade and protection\\nand what this or that political party will do for you. Why don\\'t you\\nvote a homestead for yourself? That is the only thing Uncle Sam will\\never give you. Jim Hill hasn\\'t an acre of land to sell you. We are not\\nin the real estate business. We don\\'t want you to go out West and make a\\nfailure of it because the rates at which we haul you and your goods make\\nthe first transaction a loss.... We must have landless men for a manless\\nland.\"\\n\\nUnlike steamship companies stimulating immigration to get the fares,\\nHill was seeking permanent settlers who would produce, manufacture, and\\nuse the railways as the means of exchange. Consequently he fixed low\\nrates and let his passengers take a good deal of live stock and\\nhousehold furniture free. By doing this he made an appeal that was\\nanswered by eager families. In 1894 the vanguard of home seekers left\\nIndiana in fourteen passenger coaches, filled with men, women, and\\nchildren, and forty-eight freight cars carrying their household goods\\nand live stock. In the ten years that followed, 100,000 people from the\\nMiddle West and the South, responding to his call, went to the Western\\ncountry where they brought eight million acres of prairie land under\\ncultivation.\\n\\nWhen Hill got his people on the land, he took an interest in everything\\nthat increased the productivity of their labor. Was the output of food\\nfor his freight cars limited by bad drainage on the farms? Hill then\\ninterested himself in practical ways of ditching and tiling. Were\\nfarmers hampered in hauling their goods to his trains by bad roads? In\\nthat case, he urged upon the states the improvement of highways. Did the\\ntraffic slacken because the food shipped was not of the best quality?\\nThen live stock must be improved and scientific farming promoted. Did\\nthe farmers need credit? Banks must be established close at hand to\\nadvance it. In all conferences on scientific farm management,\\nconservation of natural resources, banking and credit in relation to\\nagriculture and industry, Hill was an active participant. His was the\\nlong vision, seeing in conservation and permanent improvements the\\nfoundation of prosperity for the railways and the people.\\n\\nIndeed, he neglected no opportunity to increase the traffic on the\\nlines. He wanted no empty cars running in either direction and no wheat\\nstored in warehouses for the lack of markets. So he looked to the Orient\\nas well as to Europe as an outlet for the surplus of the farms. He sent\\nagents to China and Japan to discover what American goods and produce\\nthose countries would consume and what manufactures they had to offer to\\nAmericans in exchange. To open the Pacific trade he bought two ocean\\nmonsters, the _Minnesota_ and the _Dakota_, thus preparing for\\nemergencies West as well as East. When some Japanese came to the United\\nStates on their way to Europe to buy steel rails, Hill showed them how\\neasy it was for them to make their purchase in this country and ship by\\nway of American railways and American vessels. So the railway builder\\nand promoter, who helped to break the virgin soil of the prairies, lived\\nthrough the pioneer epoch and into the age of great finance. Before he\\ndied he saw the wheat fields of North Dakota linked with the spinning\\njennies of Manchester and the docks of Yokohama.\\n\\n\\nTHE EVOLUTION OF GRAZING AND AGRICULTURE\\n\\n=The Removal of the Indians.=--Unlike the frontier of New England in\\ncolonial days or that of Kentucky later, the advancing lines of home\\nbuilders in the Far West had little difficulty with warlike natives.\\nIndian attacks were made on the railway construction gangs; General\\nCuster had his fatal battle with the Sioux in 1876 and there were minor\\nbrushes; but they were all of relatively slight consequence. The former\\npractice of treating with the Indians as independent nations was\\nabandoned in 1871 and most of them were concentrated in reservations\\nwhere they were mainly supported by the government. The supervision of\\ntheir affairs was vested in a board of commissioners created in 1869 and\\ninstructed to treat them as wards of the nation--a trust which\\nunfortunately was often betrayed. A further step in Indian policy was\\ntaken in 1887 when provision was made for issuing lands to individual\\nIndians, thus permitting them to become citizens and settle down among\\ntheir white neighbors as farmers or cattle raisers. The disappearance of\\nthe buffalo, the main food supply of the wild Indians, had made them\\nmore tractable and more willing to surrender the freedom of the hunter\\nfor the routine of the reservation, ranch, or wheat field.\\n\\n=The Cowboy and Cattle Ranger.=--Between the frontier of farms and the\\nmountains were plains and semi-arid regions in vast reaches suitable for\\ngrazing. As soon as the railways were open into the Missouri Valley,\\naffording an outlet for stock, there sprang up to the westward cattle\\nand sheep raising on an immense scale. The far-famed American cowboy was\\nthe hero in this scene. Great herds of cattle were bred in Texas; with\\nthe advancing spring and summer seasons, they were driven northward\\nacross the plains and over the buffalo trails. In a single year, 1884,\\nit is estimated that nearly one million head of cattle were moved out of\\nTexas to the North by four thousand cowboys, supplied with 30,000\\nhorses and ponies.\\n\\nDuring the two decades from 1870 to 1890 both the cattle men and the\\nsheep raisers had an almost free run of the plains, using public lands\\nwithout paying for the privilege and waging war on one another over the\\npossession of ranges. At length, however, both had to go, as the\\nhomesteaders and land companies came and fenced in the plain and desert\\nwith endless lines of barbed wire. Already in 1893 a writer familiar\\nwith the frontier lamented the passing of the picturesque days: \"The\\nunique position of the cowboys among the Americans is jeopardized in a\\nthousand ways. Towns are growing up on their pasture lands; irrigation\\nschemes of a dozen sorts threaten to turn bunch-grass scenery into\\nfarm-land views; farmers are pre-empting valleys and the sides of\\nwaterways; and the day is not far distant when stock-raising must be\\ndone mainly in small herds, with winter corrals, and then the cowboy\\'s\\ndays will end. Even now his condition disappoints those who knew him\\nonly half a dozen years ago. His breed seems to have deteriorated and\\nhis ranks are filling with men who work for wages rather than for the\\nlove of the free life and bold companionship that once tempted men into\\nthat calling. Splendid Cheyenne saddles are less and less numerous in\\nthe outfits; the distinctive hat that made its way up from Mexico may or\\nmay not be worn; all the civil authorities in nearly all towns in the\\ngrazing country forbid the wearing of side arms; nobody shoots up these\\ntowns any more. The fact is the old simon-pure cowboy days are gone\\nalready.\"\\n\\n=Settlement under the Homestead Act of 1862.=--Two factors gave a\\nspecial stimulus to the rapid settlement of Western lands which swept\\naway the Indians and the cattle rangers. The first was the policy of the\\nrailway companies in selling large blocks of land received from the\\ngovernment at low prices to induce immigration. The second was the\\noperation of the Homestead law passed in 1862. This measure practically\\nclosed the long controversy over the disposition of the public domain\\nthat was suitable for agriculture. It provided for granting, without any\\ncost save a small registration fee, public lands in lots of 160 acres\\neach to citizens and aliens who declared their intention of becoming\\ncitizens. The one important condition attached was that the settler\\nshould occupy the farm for five years before his title was finally\\nconfirmed. Even this stipulation was waived in the case of the Civil War\\nveterans who were allowed to count their term of military service as a\\npart of the five years\\' occupancy required. As the soldiers of the\\nRevolutionary and Mexican wars had advanced in great numbers to the\\nfrontier in earlier days, so now veterans led in the settlement of the\\nmiddle border. Along with them went thousands of German, Irish, and\\nScandinavian immigrants, fresh from the Old World. Between 1867 and\\n1874, 27,000,000 acres were staked out in quarter-section farms. In\\ntwenty years (1860-80), the population of Nebraska leaped from 28,000 to\\nalmost half a million; Kansas from 100,000 to a million; Iowa from\\n600,000 to 1,600,000; and the Dakotas from 5000 to 140,000.\\n\\n=The Diversity of Western Agriculture.=--In soil, produce, and\\nmanagement, Western agriculture presented many contrasts to that of the\\nEast and South. In the region of arable and watered lands the typical\\nAmerican unit--the small farm tilled by the owner--appeared as usual;\\nbut by the side of it many a huge domain owned by foreign or Eastern\\ncompanies and tilled by hired labor. Sometimes the great estate took the\\nshape of the \"bonanza farm\" devoted mainly to wheat and corn and\\ncultivated on a large scale by machinery. Again it assumed the form of\\nthe cattle ranch embracing tens of thousands of acres. Again it was a\\nvast holding of diversified interest, such as the Santa Anita ranch near\\nLos Angeles, a domain of 60,000 acres \"cultivated in a glorious sweep of\\nvineyards and orange and olive orchards, rich sheep and cattle pastures\\nand horse ranches, their life and customs handed down from the Spanish\\nowners of the various ranches which were swept into one estate.\"\\n\\n=Irrigation.=--In one respect agriculture in the Far West was unique. In\\na large area spreading through eight states, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming,\\nUtah, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of adjoining\\nstates, the rainfall was so slight that the ordinary crops to which the\\nAmerican farmer was accustomed could not be grown at all. The Mormons\\nwere the first Anglo-Saxons to encounter aridity, and they were baffled\\nat first; but they studied it and mastered it by magnificent irrigation\\nsystems. As other settlers poured into the West the problem of the\\ndesert was attacked with a will, some of them replying to the\\ncommiseration of Eastern farmers by saying that it was easier to scoop\\nout an irrigation ditch than to cut forests and wrestle with stumps and\\nstones. Private companies bought immense areas at low prices, built\\nirrigation works, and disposed of their lands in small plots. Some\\nranchers with an instinct for water, like that of the miner for metal,\\nsank wells into the dry sand and were rewarded with gushers that \"soused\\nthe thirsty desert and turned its good-for-nothing sand into\\ngood-for-anything loam.\" The federal government came to the aid of the\\narid regions in 1894 by granting lands to the states to be used for\\nirrigation purposes. In this work Wyoming took the lead with a law which\\ninduced capitalists to invest in irrigation and at the same time\\nprovided for the sale of the redeemed lands to actual settlers. Finally\\nin 1902 the federal government by its liberal Reclamation Act added its\\nstrength to that of individuals, companies, and states in conquering\\n\"arid America.\"\\n\\n\"Nowhere,\" writes Powell, a historian of the West, in his picturesque\\n_End of the Trail_, \"has the white man fought a more courageous fight or\\nwon a more brilliant victory than in Arizona. His weapons have been the\\ntransit and the level, the drill and the dredge, the pick and the spade;\\nand the enemy which he has conquered has been the most stubborn of all\\nfoes--the hostile forces of Nature.... The story of how the white man\\nwithin the space of less than thirty years penetrated, explored, and\\nmapped this almost unknown region; of how he carried law, order, and\\njustice into a section which had never had so much as a speaking\\nacquaintance with any one of the three before; of how, realizing the\\nnecessity for means of communication, he built highways of steel across\\nthis territory from east to west and from north to south; of how,\\nundismayed by the savageness of the countenance which the desert turned\\nupon him, he laughed and rolled up his sleeves, and spat upon his hands,\\nand slashed the face of the desert with canals and irrigating ditches,\\nand filled those ditches with water brought from deep in the earth or\\nhigh in the mountains; and of how, in the conquered and submissive soil,\\nhe replaced the aloe with alfalfa, the mesquite with maize, the cactus\\nwith cotton, forms one of the most inspiring chapters in our history. It\\nis one of the epics of civilization, this reclamation of the Southwest,\\nand its heroes, thank God, are Americans.\\n\\n\"Other desert regions have been redeemed by irrigation--Egypt, for\\nexample, and Mesopotamia and parts of the Sudan--but the people of all\\nthose regions lay stretched out in the shade of a convenient palm,\\nmetaphorically speaking, and waited for some one with more energy than\\nthemselves to come along and do the work. But the Arizonians, mindful of\\nthe fact that God, the government, and Carnegie help those who help\\nthemselves, spent their days wielding the pick and shovel, and their\\nevenings in writing letters to Washington with toil-hardened hands.\\nAfter a time the government was prodded into action and the great dams\\nat Laguna and Roosevelt are the result. Then the people, organizing\\nthemselves into cooperative leagues and water-users\\' associations, took\\nup the work of reclamation where the government left off; it is to these\\nenergetic, persevering men who have drilled wells, plowed fields, and\\ndug ditches through the length and breadth of that great region which\\nstretches from Yuma to Tucson, that the metamorphosis of Arizona is\\ndue.\"\\n\\nThe effect of irrigation wherever introduced was amazing. Stretches of\\nsand and sagebrush gave way to fertile fields bearing crops of wheat,\\ncorn, fruits, vegetables, and grass. Huge ranches grazed by browsing\\nsheep were broken up into small plots. The cowboy and ranchman vanished.\\nIn their place rose the prosperous community--a community unlike the\\ntownship of Iowa or the industrial center of the East. Its intensive\\ntillage left little room for hired labor. Its small holdings drew\\nfamilies together in village life rather than dispersing them on the\\nlonely plain. Often the development of water power in connection with\\nirrigation afforded electricity for labor-saving devices and lifted many\\na burden that in other days fell heavily upon the shoulders of the\\nfarmer and his family.\\n\\n\\nMINING AND MANUFACTURING IN THE WEST\\n\\n=Mineral Resources.=--In another important particular the Far West\\ndiffered from the Mississippi Valley states. That was in the\\npredominance of mining over agriculture throughout a vast section.\\nIndeed it was the minerals rather than the land that attracted the\\npioneers who first opened the country. The discovery of gold in\\nCalifornia in 1848 was the signal for the great rush of prospectors,\\nminers, and promoters who explored the valleys, climbed the hills,\\nwashed the sands, and dug up the soil in their feverish search for gold,\\nsilver, copper, coal, and other minerals. In Nevada and Montana the\\ndevelopment of mineral resources went on all during the Civil War. Alder\\nGulch became Virginia City in 1863; Last Chance Gulch was named Helena\\nin 1864; and Confederate Gulch was christened Diamond City in 1865. At\\nButte the miners began operations in 1864 and within five years had\\nwashed out eight million dollars\\' worth of gold. Under the gold they\\nfound silver; under silver they found copper.\\n\\nEven at the end of the nineteenth century, after agriculture was well\\nadvanced and stock and sheep raising introduced on a large scale,\\nminerals continued to be the chief source of wealth in a number of\\nstates. This was revealed by the figures for 1910. The gold, silver,\\niron, and copper of Colorado were worth more than the wheat, corn, and\\noats combined; the copper of Montana sold for more than all the cereals\\nand four times the price of the wheat. The interest of Nevada was also\\nmainly mining, the receipts from the mineral output being $43,000,000 or\\nmore than one-half the national debt of Hamilton\\'s day. The yield of the\\nmines of Utah was worth four or five times the wheat crop; the coal of\\nWyoming brought twice as much as the great wool clip; the minerals of\\nArizona were totaled at $43,000,000 as against a wool clip reckoned at\\n$1,200,000; while in Idaho alone of this group of states did the wheat\\ncrop exceed in value the output of the mines.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Photograph from Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nLOGGING]\\n\\n=Timber Resources.=--The forests of the great West, unlike those of the\\nOhio Valley, proved a boon to the pioneers rather than a foe to be\\nattacked. In Ohio and Indiana, for example, the frontier line of\\nhomemakers had to cut, roll, and burn thousands of trees before they\\ncould put out a crop of any size. Beyond the Mississippi, however,\\nthere were all ready for the breaking plow great reaches of almost\\ntreeless prairie, where every stick of timber was precious. In the other\\nparts, often rough and mountainous, where stood primeval forests of the\\nfinest woods, the railroads made good use of the timber. They consumed\\nacres of forests themselves in making ties, bridge timbers, and\\ntelegraph poles, and they laid a heavy tribute upon the forests for\\ntheir annual upkeep. The surplus trees, such as had burdened the\\npioneers of the Northwest Territory a hundred years before, they carried\\noff to markets on the east and west coasts.\\n\\n=Western Industries.=--The peculiar conditions of the Far West\\nstimulated a rise of industries more rapid than is usual in new country.\\nThe mining activities which in many sections preceded agriculture called\\nfor sawmills to furnish timber for the mines and smelters to reduce and\\nrefine ores. The ranches supplied sheep and cattle for the packing\\nhouses of Kansas City as well as Chicago. The waters of the Northwest\\nafforded salmon for 4000 cases in 1866 and for 1,400,000 cases in 1916.\\nThe fruits and vegetables of California brought into existence\\ninnumerable canneries. The lumber industry, starting with crude sawmills\\nto furnish rough timbers for railways and mines, ended in specialized\\nfactories for paper, boxes, and furniture. As the railways preceded\\nsettlement and furnished a ready outlet for local manufactures, so they\\nencouraged the early establishment of varied industries, thus creating a\\nstate of affairs quite unlike that which obtained in the Ohio Valley in\\nthe early days before the opening of the Erie Canal.\\n\\n=Social Effects of Economic Activities.=--In many respects the social\\nlife of the Far West also differed from that of the Ohio Valley. The\\ntreeless prairies, though open to homesteads, favored the great estate\\ntilled in part by tenant labor and in part by migratory seasonal labor,\\nsummoned from all sections of the country for the harvests. The mineral\\nresources created hundreds of huge fortunes which made the accumulations\\nof eastern mercantile families look trivial by comparison. Other\\nmillionaires won their fortunes in the railway business and still more\\nfrom the cattle and sheep ranges. In many sections the \"cattle king,\" as\\nhe was called, was as dominant as the planter had been in the old South.\\nEverywhere in the grazing country he was a conspicuous and important\\nperson. He \"sometimes invested money in banks, in railroad stocks, or in\\ncity property.... He had his rating in the commercial reviews and could\\nhobnob with bankers, railroad presidents, and metropolitan merchants....\\nHe attended party caucuses and conventions, ran for the state\\nlegislature, and sometimes defeated a lawyer or metropolitan \\'business\\nman\\' in the race for a seat in Congress. In proportion to their numbers,\\nthe ranchers ... have constituted a highly impressive class.\"\\n\\nAlthough many of the early capitalists of the great West, especially\\nfrom Nevada, spent their money principally in the East, others took\\nleadership in promoting the sections in which they had made their\\nfortunes. A railroad pioneer, General Palmer, built his home at Colorado\\nSprings, founded the town, and encouraged local improvements. Denver\\nowed its first impressive buildings to the civic patriotism of Horace\\nTabor, a wealthy mine owner. Leland Stanford paid his tribute to\\nCalifornia in the endowment of a large university. Colonel W.F. Cody,\\nbetter known as \"Buffalo Bill,\" started his career by building a \"boom\\ntown\" which collapsed, and made a large sum of money supplying buffalo\\nmeat to construction hands (hence his popular name). By his famous Wild\\nWest Show, he increased it to a fortune which he devoted mainly to the\\npromotion of a western reclamation scheme.\\n\\nWhile the Far West was developing this vigorous, aggressive leadership\\nin business, a considerable industrial population was springing up. Even\\nthe cattle ranges and hundreds of farms were conducted like factories in\\nthat they were managed through overseers who hired plowmen, harvesters,\\nand cattlemen at regular wages. At the same time there appeared other\\npeculiar features which made a lasting impression on western economic\\nlife. Mining, lumbering, and fruit growing, for instance, employed\\nthousands of workers during the rush months and turned them out at other\\ntimes. The inevitable result was an army of migratory laborers wandering\\nfrom camp to camp, from town to town, and from ranch to ranch, without\\nfixed homes or established habits of life. From this extraordinary\\ncondition there issued many a long and lawless conflict between capital\\nand labor, giving a distinct color to the labor movement in whole\\nsections of the mountain and coast states.\\n\\n\\nTHE ADMISSION OF NEW STATES\\n\\n=The Spirit of Self-Government.=--The instinct of self-government was\\nstrong in the western communities. In the very beginning, it led to the\\norganization of volunteer committees, known as \"vigilantes,\" to suppress\\ncrime and punish criminals. As soon as enough people were settled\\npermanently in a region, they took care to form a more stable kind of\\ngovernment. An illustration of this process is found in the Oregon\\ncompact made by the pioneers in 1843, the spirit of which is reflected\\nin an editorial in an old copy of the _Rocky Mountain News_: \"We claim\\nthat any body or community of American citizens which from any cause or\\nunder any circumstances is cut off from or from isolation is so situated\\nas not to be under any active and protecting branch of the central\\ngovernment, have a right, if on American soil, to frame a government and\\nenact such laws and regulations as may be necessary for their own\\nsafety, protection, and happiness, always with the condition precedent,\\nthat they shall, at the earliest moment when the central government\\nshall extend an effective organization and laws over them, give it their\\nunqualified support and obedience.\"\\n\\nPeople who turned so naturally to the organization of local\\nadministration were equally eager for admission to the union as soon as\\nany shadow of a claim to statehood could be advanced. As long as a\\nregion was merely one of the territories of the United States, the\\nappointment of the governor and other officers was controlled by\\npolitics at Washington. Moreover the disposition of land, mineral\\nrights, forests, and water power was also in the hands of national\\nleaders. Thus practical considerations were united with the spirit of\\nindependence in the quest for local autonomy.\\n\\n=Nebraska and Colorado.=--Two states, Nebraska and Colorado, had little\\ndifficulty in securing admission to the union. The first, Nebraska, had\\nbeen organized as a territory by the famous Kansas-Nebraska bill which\\ndid so much to precipitate the Civil War. Lying to the north of Kansas,\\nwhich had been admitted in 1861, it escaped the invasion of slave owners\\nfrom Missouri and was settled mainly by farmers from the North. Though\\nit claimed a population of only 67,000, it was regarded with kindly\\ninterest by the Republican Congress at Washington and, reduced to its\\npresent boundaries, it received the coveted statehood in 1867.\\n\\nThis was hardly accomplished before the people of Colorado to the\\nsouthwest began to make known their demands. They had been organized\\nunder territorial government in 1861 when they numbered only a handful;\\nbut within ten years the aspect of their affairs had completely changed.\\nThe silver and gold deposits of the Leadville and Cripple Creek regions\\nhad attracted an army of miners and prospectors. The city of Denver,\\nfounded in 1858 and named after the governor of Kansas whence came many\\nof the early settlers, had grown from a straggling camp of log huts into\\na prosperous center of trade. By 1875 it was reckoned that the\\npopulation of the territory was not less than one hundred thousand; the\\nfollowing year Congress, yielding to the popular appeal, made Colorado a\\nmember of the American union.\\n\\n=Six New States (1889-1890).=--For many years there was a deadlock in\\nCongress over the admission of new states. The spell was broken in 1889\\nunder the leadership of the Dakotas. For a long time the Dakota\\nterritory, organized in 1861, had been looked upon as the home of the\\npowerful Sioux Indians whose enormous reservation blocked the advance of\\nthe frontier. The discovery of gold in the Black Hills, however, marked\\ntheir doom. Even before Congress could open their lands to prospectors,\\npioneers were swarming over the country. Farmers from the adjoining\\nMinnesota and the Eastern states, Scandinavians, Germans, and Canadians,\\ncame in swelling waves to occupy the fertile Dakota lands, now famous\\neven as far away as the fjords of Norway. Seldom had the plow of man cut\\nthrough richer soil than was found in the bottoms of the Red River\\nValley, and it became all the more precious when the opening of the\\nNorthern Pacific in 1883 afforded a means of transportation east and\\nwest. The population, which had numbered 135,000 in 1880, passed the\\nhalf million mark before ten years had elapsed.\\n\\nRemembering that Nebraska had been admitted with only 67,000\\ninhabitants, the Dakotans could not see why they should be kept under\\nfederal tutelage. At the same time Washington, far away on the Pacific\\nCoast, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, boasting of their populations and\\ntheir riches, put in their own eloquent pleas. But the members of\\nCongress were busy with politics. The Democrats saw no good reason for\\nadmitting new Republican states until after their defeat in 1888. Near\\nthe end of their term the next year they opened the door for North and\\nSouth Dakota, Washington, and Montana. In 1890, a Republican Congress\\nbrought Idaho and Wyoming into the union, the latter with woman\\nsuffrage, which had been granted twenty-one years before.\\n\\n=Utah.=--Although Utah had long presented all the elements of a\\nwell-settled and industrious community, its admission to the union was\\ndelayed on account of popular hostility to the practice of polygamy. The\\ncustom, it is true, had been prohibited by act of Congress in 1862; but\\nthe law had been systematically evaded. In 1882 Congress made another\\nand more effective effort to stamp out polygamy. Five years later it\\neven went so far as to authorize the confiscation of the property of the\\nMormon Church in case the practice of plural marriages was not stopped.\\nMeanwhile the Gentile or non-Mormon population was steadily increasing\\nand the leaders in the Church became convinced that the battle\\nagainst the sentiment of the country was futile. At last in 1896 Utah\\nwas admitted as a state under a constitution which forbade plural\\nmarriages absolutely and forever. Horace Greeley, who visited Utah in\\n1859, had prophesied that the Pacific Railroad would work a revolution\\nin the land of Brigham Young. His prophecy had come true.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1912]\\n\\n=Rounding out the Continent.=--Three more territories now remained out\\nof the Union. Oklahoma, long an Indian reservation, had been opened for\\nsettlement to white men in 1889. The rush upon the fertile lands of this\\nregion, the last in the history of America, was marked by all the frenzy\\nof the final, desperate chance. At a signal from a bugle an army of men\\nwith families in wagons, men and women on horseback and on foot, burst\\ninto the territory. During the first night a city of tents was raised at\\nGuthrie and Oklahoma City. In ten days wooden houses rose on the plains.\\nIn a single year there were schools, churches, business blocks, and\\nnewspapers. Within fifteen years there was a population of more than\\nhalf a million. To the west, Arizona with a population of about 125,000\\nand New Mexico with 200,000 inhabitants joined Oklahoma in asking for\\nstatehood. Congress, then Republican, looked with reluctance upon the\\naddition of more Democratic states; but in 1907 it was literally\\ncompelled by public sentiment and a sense of justice to admit Oklahoma.\\nIn 1910 the House of Representatives went to the Democrats and within\\ntwo years Arizona and New Mexico were \"under the roof.\" So the\\ncontinental domain was rounded out.\\n\\n\\nTHE INFLUENCE OF THE FAR WEST ON NATIONAL LIFE\\n\\n=The Last of the Frontier.=--When Horace Greeley made his trip west in\\n1859 he thus recorded the progress of civilization in his journal:\\n\\n     \"May 12th, Chicago.--Chocolate and morning journals last\\n     seen on the hotel breakfast table.\\n\\n     23rd, Leavenworth (Kansas).--Room bells and bath tubs make\\n     their final appearance.\\n\\n     26th, Manhattan.--Potatoes and eggs last recognized among\\n     the blessings that \\'brighten as they take their flight.\\'\\n\\n     27th, Junction City.--Last visitation of a boot-black, with\\n     dissolving views of a board bedroom. Beds bid us good-by.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Panama-California Exposition_\\n\\nTHE CANADIAN BUILDING AT THE PANAMA-CALIFORNIA INTERNATIONAL\\nEXPOSITION, SAN DIEGO, 1915]\\n\\nWithin thirty years travelers were riding across that country in Pullman\\ncars and enjoying at the hotels all the comforts of a standardized\\ncivilization. The \"wild west\" was gone, and with it that frontier of\\npioneers and settlers who had long given such a bent and tone to\\nAmerican life and had \"poured in upon the floor of Congress\" such a long\\nline of \"backwoods politicians,\" as they were scornfully styled.\\n\\n=Free Land and Eastern Labor.=--It was not only the picturesque features\\nof the frontier that were gone. Of far more consequence was the\\ndisappearance of free lands with all that meant for American labor. For\\nmore than a hundred years, any man of even moderate means had been able\\nto secure a homestead of his own and an independent livelihood. For a\\nhundred years America had been able to supply farms to as many\\nimmigrants as cared to till the soil. Every new pair of strong arms\\nmeant more farms and more wealth. Workmen in Eastern factories, mines,\\nor mills who did not like their hours, wages, or conditions of labor,\\ncould readily find an outlet to the land. Now all that was over. By\\nabout 1890 most of the desirable land available under the Homestead act\\nhad disappeared. American industrial workers confronted a new situation.\\n\\n=Grain Supplants King Cotton.=--In the meantime a revolution was taking\\nplace in agriculture. Until 1860 the chief staples sold by America were\\ncotton and tobacco. With the advance of the frontier, corn and wheat\\nsupplanted them both in agrarian economy. The West became the granary of\\nthe East and of Western Europe. The scoop shovel once used to handle\\ngrain was superseded by the towering elevator, loading and unloading\\nthousands of bushels every hour. The refrigerator car and ship made the\\npacking industry as stable as the production of cotton or corn, and gave\\nan immense impetus to cattle raising and sheep farming. So the meat of\\nthe West took its place on the English dinner table by the side of bread\\nbaked from Dakotan wheat.\\n\\n=Aid in American Economic Independence.=--The effects of this economic\\nmovement were manifold and striking. Billions of dollars\\' worth of\\nAmerican grain, dairy produce, and meat were poured into European\\nmarkets where they paid off debts due money lenders and acquired\\ncapital to develop American resources. Thus they accelerated the\\nprogress of American financiers toward national independence. The\\ncountry, which had timidly turned to the Old World for capital in\\nHamilton\\'s day and had borrowed at high rates of interest in London in\\nLincoln\\'s day, moved swiftly toward the time when it would be among the\\nworld\\'s first bankers and money lenders itself. Every grain of wheat and\\ncorn pulled the balance down on the American side of the scale.\\n\\n=Eastern Agriculture Affected.=--In the East as well as abroad the\\nopening of the western granary produced momentous results. The\\nagricultural economy of that part of the country was changed in many\\nrespects. Whole sections of the poorest land went almost out of\\ncultivation, the abandoned farms of the New England hills bearing solemn\\nwitness to the competing power of western wheat fields. Sheep and cattle\\nraising, as well as wheat and corn production, suffered at least a\\nrelative decline. Thousands of farmers cultivating land of the lower\\ngrade were forced to go West or were driven to the margin of\\nsubsistence. Even the herds that supplied Eastern cities with milk were\\nfed upon grain brought halfway across the continent.\\n\\n=The Expansion of the American Market.=--Upon industry as well as\\nagriculture, the opening of vast food-producing regions told in a\\nthousand ways. The demand for farm machinery, clothing, boots, shoes,\\nand other manufactures gave to American industries such a market as even\\nHamilton had never foreseen. Moreover it helped to expand far into the\\nMississippi Valley the industrial area once confined to the Northern\\nseaboard states and to transform the region of the Great Lakes into an\\nindustrial empire. Herein lies the explanation of the growth of\\nmid-western cities after 1865. Chicago, with its thirty-five railways,\\ntapped every locality of the West and South. To the railways were added\\nthe water routes of the Lakes, thus creating a strategic center for\\nindustries. Long foresight carried the McCormick reaper works to\\nChicago before 1860. From Troy, New York, went a large stove plant. That\\nwas followed by a shoe factory from Massachusetts. The packing industry\\nrose as a matter of course at a point so advantageous for cattle raisers\\nand shippers and so well connected with Eastern markets.\\n\\nTo the opening of the Far West also the Lake region was indebted for a\\nlarge part of that water-borne traffic which made it \"the Mediterranean\\nbasin of North America.\" The produce of the West and the manufactures of\\nthe East poured through it in an endless stream. The swift growth of\\nshipbuilding on the Great Lakes helped to compensate for the decline of\\nthe American marine on the high seas. In response to this stimulus\\nDetroit could boast that her shipwrights were able to turn out a ten\\nthousand ton Leviathan for ore or grain about \"as quickly as carpenters\\ncould put up an eight-room house.\" Thus in relation to the Far West the\\nold Northwest territory--the wilderness of Jefferson\\'s time--had taken\\nthe position formerly occupied by New England alone. It was supplying\\ncapital and manufactures for a vast agricultural empire West and South.\\n\\n=America on the Pacific.=--It has been said that the Mediterranean Sea\\nwas the center of ancient civilization; that modern civilization has\\ndeveloped on the shores of the Atlantic; and that the future belongs to\\nthe Pacific. At any rate, the sweep of the United States to the shores\\nof the Pacific quickly exercised a powerful influence on world affairs\\nand it undoubtedly has a still greater significance for the future.\\n\\nVery early regular traffic sprang up between the Pacific ports and the\\nHawaiian Islands, China, and Japan. Two years before the adjustment of\\nthe Oregon controversy with England, namely in 1844, the United States\\nhad established official and trading relations with China. Ten years\\nlater, four years after the admission of California to the union, the\\nbarred door of Japan was forced open by Commodore Perry. The commerce\\nwhich had long before developed between the Pacific ports and Hawaii,\\nChina, and Japan now flourished under official care. In 1865 a ship\\nfrom Honolulu carried sugar, molasses, and fruits from Hawaii to the\\nOregon port of Astoria. The next year a vessel from Hongkong brought\\nrice, mats, and tea from China. An era of lucrative trade was opened.\\nThe annexation of Hawaii in 1898, the addition of the Philippines at the\\nsame time, and the participation of American troops in the suppression\\nof the Boxer rebellion in Peking in 1900, were but signs and symbols of\\nAmerican power on the Pacific.\\n\\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\\n\\nCOMMODORE PERRY\\'S MEN MAKING PRESENTS TO THE JAPANESE]\\n\\n=Conservation and the Land Problem.=--The disappearance of the frontier\\nalso brought new and serious problems to the governments of the states\\nand the nation. The people of the whole United States suddenly were\\nforced to realize that there was a limit to the rich, new land to\\nexploit and to the forests and minerals awaiting the ax and the pick.\\nThen arose in America the questions which had long perplexed the\\ncountries of the Old World--the scientific use of the soils and\\nconservation of natural resources. Hitherto the government had followed\\nthe easy path of giving away arable land and selling forest and mineral\\nlands at low prices. Now it had to face far more difficult and complex\\nproblems. It also had to consider questions of land tenure again,\\nespecially if the ideal of a nation of home-owning farmers was to be\\nmaintained. While there was plenty of land for every man or woman who\\nwanted a home on the soil, it made little difference if single landlords\\nor companies got possession of millions of acres, if a hundred men in\\none western river valley owned 17,000,000 acres; but when the good land\\nfor small homesteads was all gone, then was raised the real issue. At\\nthe opening of the twentieth century the nation, which a hundred years\\nbefore had land and natural resources apparently without limit, was\\ncompelled to enact law after law conserving its forests and minerals.\\nThen it was that the great state of California, on the very border of\\nthe continent, felt constrained to enact a land settlement measure\\nproviding government assistance in an effort to break up large holdings\\ninto small lots and to make it easy for actual settlers to acquire small\\nfarms. America was passing into a new epoch.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nHenry Inman, _The Old Santa Fe Trail_.\\n\\nR.I. Dodge, _The Plains of the Great West_ (1877).\\n\\nC.H.

During none\\nof that time was there a clash of opinion over specific issues such as\\nrent the country in 1800 when Jefferson rode a popular wave to victory,\\nor again in 1828 when Jackson\\'s western hordes came sweeping into power.\\nThe Democrats, who before 1860 definitely opposed protective tariffs,\\nfederal banking, internal improvements, and heavy taxes, now spoke\\ncautiously on all these points. The Republicans, conscious of the fact\\nthat they had been a minority of the voters in 1860 and warned by the\\nearly loss of the House of Representatives in 1874, also moved with\\nconsiderable prudence among the perplexing problems of the day. Again\\nand again the votes in Congress showed that no clear line separated all\\nthe Democrats from all the Republicans. There were Republicans who\\nfavored tariff reductions and \"cheap money.\" There were Democrats who\\nlooked with partiality upon high protection or with indulgence upon the\\ncontraction of the currency. Only on matters relating to the coercion of\\nthe South was the division between the parties fairly definite; this\\ncould be readily accounted for on practical as well as sentimental\\ngrounds.\\n\\nAfter all, the vague criticisms and proposals that found their way into\\nthe political platforms did but reflect the confusion of mind prevailing\\nin the country. The fact that, out of the eighteen years between 1875\\nand 1893, the Democrats held the House of Representatives for fourteen\\nyears while the Republicans had every President but one showed that the\\nvoters, like the politicians, were in a state of indecision. Hayes had a\\nDemocratic House during his entire term and a Democratic Senate for two\\nyears of the four. Cleveland was confronted by a belligerent Republican\\nmajority in the Senate during his first administration; and at the same\\ntime was supported by a Democratic majority in the House. Harrison was\\nsustained by continuous Republican successes in Senatorial elections;\\nbut in the House he had the barest majority from 1889 to 1891 and lost\\nthat altogether at the election held in the middle of his term. The\\nopinion of the country was evidently unsettled and fluctuating. It was\\nstill distracted by memories of the dead past and uncertain as to the\\ntrend of the future.\\n\\n\\nTHE CURRENCY QUESTION\\n\\nNevertheless these years of muddled politics and nebulous issues proved\\nto be a period in which social forces were gathering for the great\\ncampaign of 1896. Except for three new features--the railways, the\\ntrusts, and the trade unions--the subjects of debate among the people\\nwere the same as those that had engaged their attention since the\\nfoundation of the republic: the currency, the national debt, banking,\\nthe tariff, and taxation.\\n\\n=Debtors and the Fall in Prices.=--For many reasons the currency\\nquestion occupied the center of interest. As of old, the farmers and\\nplanters of the West and South were heavily in debt to the East for\\nborrowed money secured by farm mortgages; and they counted upon the sale\\nof cotton, corn, wheat, and hogs to meet interest and principal when\\ndue. During the war, the Western farmers had been able to dispose of\\ntheir produce at high prices and thus discharge their debts with\\ncomparative ease; but after the war prices declined. Wheat that sold at\\ntwo dollars a bushel in 1865 brought sixty-four cents twenty years\\nlater. The meaning of this for the farmers in debt--and nearly\\nthree-fourths of them were in that class--can be shown by a single\\nillustration. A thousand-dollar mortgage on a Western farm could be paid\\noff by five hundred bushels of wheat when prices were high; whereas it\\ntook about fifteen hundred bushels to pay the same debt when wheat was\\nat the bottom of the scale. For the farmer, it must be remembered, wheat\\nwas the measure of his labor, the product of his toil under the summer\\nsun; and in its price he found the test of his prosperity.\\n\\n=Creditors and Falling Prices.=--To the bondholders or creditors, on the\\nother hand, falling prices were clear gain. If a fifty-dollar coupon on\\na bond bought seventy or eighty bushels of wheat instead of twenty or\\nthirty, the advantage to the owner of the coupon was obvious. Moreover\\nthe advantage seemed to him entirely just. Creditors had suffered heavy\\nlosses when the Civil War carried prices skyward while the interest\\nrates on their old bonds remained stationary. For example, if a man had\\na $1000 bond issued before 1860 and paying interest at five per cent, he\\nreceived fifty dollars a year from it. Before the war each dollar would\\nbuy a bushel of wheat; in 1865 it would only buy half a bushel. When\\nprices--that is, the cost of living--began to go down, creditors\\ntherefore generally regarded the change with satisfaction as a return to\\nnormal conditions.\\n\\n=The Cause of Falling Prices.=--The fall in prices was due, no doubt, to\\nmany factors. Among them must be reckoned the discontinuance of\\ngovernment buying for war purposes, labor-saving farm machinery,\\nimmigration, and the opening of new wheat-growing regions. The currency,\\ntoo, was an element in the situation. Whatever the cause, the\\ndiscontented farmers believed that the way to raise prices was to issue\\nmore money. They viewed it as a case of supply and demand. If there was\\na small volume of currency in circulation, prices would be low; if there\\nwas a large volume, prices would be high. Hence they looked with favor\\nupon all plans to increase the amount of money in circulation. First\\nthey advocated more paper notes--greenbacks--and then they turned to\\nsilver as the remedy. The creditors, on the other hand, naturally\\napproved the reduction of the volume of currency. They wished to see the\\ngreenbacks withdrawn from circulation and gold--a metal more limited in\\nvolume than silver--made the sole basis of the national monetary system.\\n\\n=The Battle over the Greenbacks.=--The contest between these factions\\nbegan as early as 1866. In that year, Congress enacted a law authorizing\\nthe Treasury to withdraw the greenbacks from circulation. The paper\\nmoney party set up a shrill cry of protest, and kept up the fight until,\\nin 1878, it forced Congress to provide for the continuous re-issue of\\nthe legal tender notes as they came into the Treasury in payment of\\ntaxes and other dues. Then could the friends of easy money rejoice:\\n\\n    \"Thou, Greenback, \\'tis of thee\\n     Fair money of the free,\\n      Of thee we sing.\"\\n\\n=Resumption of Specie Payment.=--There was, however, another side to\\nthis victory. The opponents of the greenbacks, unable to stop the\\ncirculation of paper, induced Congress to pass a law in 1875 providing\\nthat on and after January 1, 1879, \"the Secretary of the Treasury shall\\nredeem in coin the United States legal tender notes then outstanding on\\ntheir presentation at the office of the Assistant Treasurer of the\\nUnited States in the City of New York in sums of not less than fifty\\ndollars.\" \"The way to resume,\" John Sherman had said, \"is to resume.\"\\nWhen the hour for redemption arrived, the Treasury was prepared with a\\nlarge hoard of gold. \"On the appointed day,\" wrote the assistant\\nsecretary, \"anxiety reigned in the office of the Treasury. Hour after\\nhour passed; no news from New York. Inquiry by wire showed that all was\\nquiet. At the close of the day this message came: \\'$135,000 of notes\\npresented for coin--$400,000 of gold for notes.\\' That was all.\\nResumption was accomplished with no disturbance. By five o\\'clock the\\nnews was all over the land, and the New York bankers were sipping their\\ntea in absolute safety.\"\\n\\n=The Specie Problem--the Parity of Gold and Silver.=--Defeated in their\\nefforts to stop \"the present suicidal and destructive policy of\\ncontraction,\" the advocates of an abundant currency demanded an increase\\nin the volume of silver in circulation. This precipitated one of the\\nsharpest political battles in American history. The issue turned on\\nlegal as well as economic points. The Constitution gave Congress the\\npower to coin money and it forbade the states to make anything but gold\\nand silver legal tender in the payment of debts. It evidently\\ncontemplated the use of both metals in the currency system. Such, at\\nleast, was the view of many eminent statesmen, including no less a\\npersonage than James G. Blaine. The difficulty, however, lay in\\nmaintaining gold and silver coins on a level which would permit them to\\ncirculate with equal facility. Obviously, if the gold in a gold dollar\\nexceeds the value of the silver in a silver dollar on the open market,\\nmen will hoard gold money and leave silver money in circulation. When,\\nfor example, Congress in 1792 fixed the ratio of the two metals at one\\nto fifteen--one ounce of gold declared worth fifteen of silver--it was\\nsoon found that gold had been undervalued. When again in 1834 the ratio\\nwas put at one to sixteen, it was found that silver was undervalued.\\nConsequently the latter metal was not brought in for coinage and silver\\nalmost dropped out of circulation. Many a silver dollar was melted down\\nby silverware factories.\\n\\n=Silver Demonetized in 1873.=--So things stood in 1873. At that time,\\nCongress, in enacting a mintage law, discontinued the coinage of the\\nstandard silver dollar, then practically out of circulation. This act\\nwas denounced later by the friends of silver as \"the crime of \\'73,\" a\\nconspiracy devised by the money power and secretly carried out. This\\ncontention the debates in Congress do not seem to sustain. In the course\\nof the argument on the mint law it was distinctly said by one speaker at\\nleast: \"This bill provides for the making of changes in the legal tender\\ncoin of the country and for substituting as legal tender, coin of only\\none metal instead of two as heretofore.\"\\n\\n=The Decline in the Value of Silver.=--Absorbed in the greenback\\ncontroversy, the people apparently did not appreciate, at the time, the\\nsignificance of the \"demonetization\" of silver; but within a few years\\nseveral events united in making it the center of a political storm.\\nGermany, having abandoned silver in 1871, steadily increased her demand\\nfor gold. Three years later, the countries of the Latin Union followed\\nthis example, thus helping to enhance the price of the yellow metal. All\\nthe while, new silver lodes, discovered in the Far West, were pouring\\ninto the market great streams of the white metal, bearing down the\\nprice. Then came the resumption of specie payment, which, in effect,\\nplaced the paper money on a gold basis. Within twenty years silver was\\nworth in gold only about half the price of 1870.\\n\\nThat there had been a real decline in silver was denied by the friends\\nof that metal. They alleged that gold had gone up because it had been\\ngiven a monopoly in the coinage markets of civilized governments. This\\nmonopoly, they continued, was the fruit of a conspiracy against the\\npeople conceived by the bankers of the world. Moreover, they went on,\\nthe placing of the greenbacks on a gold basis had itself worked a\\ncontraction of the currency; it lowered the prices of labor and produce\\nto the advantage of the holders of long-term investments bearing a fixed\\nrate of interest. When wheat sold at sixty-four cents a bushel, their\\nsearch for relief became desperate, and they at last concentrated their\\nefforts on opening the mints of the government for the free coinage of\\nsilver at the ratio of sixteen to one.\\n\\n=Republicans and Democrats Divided.=--On this question both Republicans\\nand Democrats were divided, the line being drawn between the East on the\\none hand and the South and West on the other, rather than between the\\ntwo leading parties. So trusted a leader as James G. Blaine avowed, in a\\nspeech delivered in the Senate in 1878, that, as the Constitution\\nrequired Congress to make both gold and silver the money of the land,\\nthe only question left was that of fixing the ratio between them. He\\naffirmed, moreover, the main contention of the silver faction that a\\nreopening of the government mints of the world to silver would bring it\\nup to its old relation with gold. He admitted also that their most\\nominous warnings were well founded, saying: \"I believe the struggle now\\ngoing on in this country and in other countries for a single gold\\nstandard would, if successful, produce widespread disaster throughout\\nthe commercial world. The destruction of silver as money and the\\nestablishment of gold as the sole unit of value must have a ruinous\\neffect on all forms of property, except those investments which yield a\\nfixed return.\"\\n\\nThis was exactly the concession that the silver party wanted.\\n\"Three-fourths of the business enterprises of this country are conducted\\non borrowed capital,\" said Senator Jones, of Nevada. \"Three-fourths of\\nthe homes and farms that stand in the names of the actual occupants have\\nbeen bought on time and a very large proportion of them are mortgaged\\nfor the payment of some part of the purchase money. Under the operation\\nof a shrinkage in the volume of money, this enormous mass of borrowers,\\nat the maturity of their respective debts, though nominally paying no\\nmore than the amount borrowed, with interest, are in reality, in the\\namount of the principal alone, returning a percentage of value greater\\nthan they received--more in equity than they contracted to pay.... In\\nall discussions of the subject the creditors attempt to brush aside the\\nequities involved by sneering at the debtors.\"\\n\\n=The Silver Purchase Act (1878).=--Even before the actual resumption of\\nspecie payment, the advocates of free silver were a power to be reckoned\\nwith, particularly in the Democratic party. They had a majority in the\\nHouse of Representatives in 1878 and they carried a silver bill through\\nthat chamber. Blocked by the Republican Senate they accepted a\\ncompromise in the Bland-Allison bill, which provided for huge monthly\\npurchases of silver by the government for coinage into dollars. So\\nstrong was the sentiment that a two-thirds majority was mustered after\\nPresident Hayes vetoed the measure.\\n\\nThe effect of this act, as some had anticipated, was disappointing. It\\ndid not stay silver on its downward course. Thereupon the silver faction\\npressed through Congress in 1886 a bill providing for the issue of paper\\ncertificates based on the silver accumulated in the Treasury. Still\\nsilver continued to fall. Then the advocates of inflation declared that\\nthey would be content with nothing short of free coinage at the ratio of\\nsixteen to one. If the issue had been squarely presented in 1890, there\\nis good reason for believing that free silver would have received a\\nmajority in both houses of Congress; but it was not presented.\\n\\n=The Sherman Silver Purchase Act and the Bond Sales.=--Republican\\nleaders, particularly from the East, stemmed the silver tide by a\\ndiversion of forces. They passed the Sherman Act of 1890 providing for\\nlarge monthly purchases of silver and for the issue of notes redeemable\\nin gold or silver at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury. In\\na clause of superb ambiguity they announced that it was \"the established\\npolicy of the United States to maintain the two metals on a parity with\\neach other upon the present legal ratio or such other ratio as may be\\nprovided by law.\" For a while silver was buoyed up. Then it turned once\\nmore on its downward course. In the meantime the Treasury was in a sad\\nplight. To maintain the gold reserve, President Cleveland felt compelled\\nto sell government bonds; and to his dismay he found that as soon as the\\ngold was brought in at the front door of the Treasury, notes were\\npresented for redemption and the gold was quickly carried out at the\\nback door. Alarmed at the vicious circle thus created, he urged upon\\nCongress the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. For this he was\\nroundly condemned by many of his own followers who branded his conduct\\nas \"treason to the party\"; but the Republicans, especially from the\\nEast, came to his rescue and in 1893 swept the troublesome sections of\\nthe law from the statute book. The anger of the silver faction knew no\\nbounds, and the leaders made ready for the approaching presidential\\ncampaign.\\n\\n\\nTHE PROTECTIVE TARIFF AND TAXATION\\n\\n=Fluctuation in Tariff Policy.=--As each of the old parties was divided\\non the currency question, it is not surprising that there was some\\nconfusion in their ranks over the tariff. Like the silver issue, the\\ntariff tended to align the manufacturing East against the agricultural\\nWest and South rather than to cut directly between the two parties.\\nStill the Republicans on the whole stood firmly by the rates imposed\\nduring the Civil War. If we except the reductions of 1872 which were\\nsoon offset by increases, we may say that those rates were substantially\\nunchanged for nearly twenty years. When a revision was brought about,\\nhowever, it was initiated by Republican leaders. Seeing a huge surplus\\nof revenue in the Treasury in 1883, they anticipated popular clamor by\\nrevising the tariff on the theory that it ought to be reformed by its\\nfriends rather than by its enemies. On the other hand, it was the\\nRepublicans also who enacted the McKinley tariff bill of 1890, which\\ncarried protection to its highest point up to that time.\\n\\nThe Democrats on their part were not all confirmed free traders or even\\nadvocates of tariff for revenue only. In Cleveland\\'s first\\nadministration they did attack the protective system in the House, where\\nthey had a majority, and in this they were vigorously supported by the\\nPresident. The assault, however, proved to be a futile gesture for it\\nwas blocked by the Republicans in the Senate. When, after the sweeping\\nvictory of 1892, the Democrats in the House again attempted to bring\\ndown the tariff by the Wilson bill of 1894, they were checkmated by\\ntheir own party colleagues in the upper chamber. In the end they were\\ndriven into a compromise that looked more like a McKinley than a Calhoun\\ntariff. The Republicans taunted them with being \"babes in the woods.\"\\nPresident Cleveland was so dissatisfied with the bill that he refused to\\nsign it, allowing it to become a law, on the lapse of ten days, without\\nhis approval.\\n\\n=The Income Tax of 1894.=--The advocates of tariff reduction usually\\nassociated with their proposal a tax on incomes. The argument which\\nthey advanced in support of their program was simple. Most of the\\nindustries, they said, are in the East and the protective tariff which\\ntaxes consumers for the benefit of manufacturers is, in effect, a\\ntribute laid upon the rest of the country. As an offset they offered a\\ntax on large incomes; this owing to the heavy concentration of rich\\npeople in the East, would fall mainly upon the beneficiaries of\\nprotection. \"We propose,\" said one of them, \"to place a part of the\\nburden upon the accumulated wealth of the country instead of placing it\\nall upon the consumption of the people.\" In this spirit the sponsors of\\nthe Wilson tariff bill laid a tax upon all incomes of $4000 a year or\\nmore.\\n\\nIn taking this step, the Democrats encountered opposition in their own\\nparty. Senator Hill, of New York, turned fiercely upon them, exclaiming:\\n\"The professors with their books, the socialists with their schemes, the\\nanarchists with their bombs are all instructing the people in the ...\\nprinciples of taxation.\" Even the Eastern Republicans were hardly as\\nsavage in their denunciation of the tax. But all this labor was wasted.\\nThe next year the Supreme Court of the United States declared the income\\ntax to be a direct tax, and therefore null and void because it was laid\\non incomes wherever found and not apportioned among the states according\\nto population. The fact that four of the nine judges dissented from this\\ndecision was also an index to the diversity of opinion that divided both\\nparties.\\n\\n\\nTHE RAILWAYS AND TRUSTS\\n\\n=The Grangers and State Regulation.=--The same uncertainty about the\\nrailways and trusts pervaded the ranks of the Republicans and Democrats.\\nAs to the railways, the first firm and consistent demand for their\\nregulation came from the West. There the farmers, in the early\\nseventies, having got control in state legislatures, particularly in\\nIowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois, enacted drastic laws prescribing the\\nmaximum charges which companies could make for carrying freight and\\npassengers. The application of these measures, however, was limited\\nbecause the state could not fix the rates for transporting goods and\\npassengers beyond its own borders. The power of regulating interstate\\ncommerce, under the Constitution, belonged to Congress.\\n\\n=The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887.=--Within a few years, the movement\\nwhich had been so effective in western legislatures appeared at\\nWashington in the form of demands for the federal regulation of\\ninterstate rates. In 1887, the pressure became so strong that Congress\\ncreated the interstate commerce commission and forbade many abuses on\\nthe part of railways; such as discriminating in charges between one\\nshipper and another and granting secret rebates to favored persons. This\\nlaw was a significant beginning; but it left the main question of\\nrate-fixing untouched, much to the discontent of farmers and shippers.\\n\\n=The Sherman Anti-Trust Law of 1890.=--As in the case of the railways,\\nattacks upon the trusts were first made in state legislatures, where it\\nbecame the fashion to provide severe penalties for those who formed\\nmonopolies and \"conspired to enhance prices.\" Republicans and Democrats\\nunited in the promotion of measures of this kind. As in the case of the\\nrailways also, the movement to curb the trusts soon had spokesmen at\\nWashington. Though Blaine had declared that \"trusts were largely a\\nprivate affair with which neither the President nor any private citizen\\nhad any particular right to interfere,\" it was a Republican Congress\\nthat enacted in 1890 the first measure--the Sherman Anti-Trust\\nLaw--directed against great combinations in business. This act declared\\nillegal \"every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise,\\nor conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce among the several\\nstates or with foreign nations.\"\\n\\n=The Futility of the Anti-Trust Law.=--Whether the Sherman law was\\ndirected against all combinations or merely those which placed an\\n\"unreasonable restraint\" on trade and competition was not apparent.\\nSenator Platt of Connecticut, a careful statesman of the old school,\\naverred: \"The questions of whether the bill would be operative, of how\\nit would operate, or whether it was within the power of Congress to\\nenact it, have been whistled down the wind in this Senate as idle talk\\nand the whole effort has been to get some bill headed: \\'A bill to punish\\ntrusts,\\' with which to go to the country.\" Whatever its purpose, its\\neffect upon existing trusts and upon the formation of new combinations\\nwas negligible. It was practically unenforced by President Harrison and\\nPresident Cleveland, in spite of the constant demand for harsh action\\nagainst \"monopolies.\" It was patent that neither the Republicans nor the\\nDemocrats were prepared for a war on the trusts to the bitter end.\\n\\n\\nTHE MINOR PARTIES AND UNREST\\n\\n=The Demands of Dissenting Parties.=--From the election of 1872, when\\nHorace Greeley made his ill-fated excursion into politics, onward, there\\nappeared in each presidential campaign one, and sometimes two or more\\nparties, stressing issues that appealed mainly to wage-earners and\\nfarmers. Whether they chose to call themselves Labor Reformers,\\nGreenbackers, or Anti-monopolists, their slogans and their platforms all\\npointed in one direction. Even the Prohibitionists, who in 1872 started\\non their career with a single issue, the abolition of the liquor\\ntraffic, found themselves making declarations of faith on other matters\\nand hopelessly split over the money question in 1896.\\n\\nA composite view of the platforms put forth by the dissenting parties\\nfrom the administration of Grant to the close of Cleveland\\'s second term\\nreveals certain notions common to them all. These included among many\\nothers: the earliest possible payment of the national debt; regulation\\nof the rates of railways and telegraph companies; repeal of the specie\\nresumption act of 1875; the issue of legal tender notes by the\\ngovernment convertible into interest-bearing obligations on demand;\\nunlimited coinage of silver as well as gold; a graduated inheritance\\ntax; legislation to take from \"land, railroad, money, and other gigantic\\ncorporate monopolies ... the powers they have so corruptly and unjustly\\nusurped\"; popular or direct election of United States Senators; woman\\nsuffrage; and a graduated income tax, \"placing the burden of government\\non those who can best afford to pay instead of laying it on the farmers\\nand producers.\"\\n\\n=Criticism of the Old Parties.=--To this long program of measures the\\nreformers added harsh and acrid criticism of the old parties and\\nsometimes, it must be said, of established institutions of government.\\n\"We denounce,\" exclaimed the Labor party in 1888, \"the Democratic and\\nRepublican parties as hopelessly and shamelessly corrupt and by reason\\nof their affiliation with monopolies equally unworthy of the suffrages\\nof those who do not live upon public plunder.\" \"The United States\\nSenate,\" insisted the Greenbackers, \"is a body composed largely of\\naristocratic millionaires who according to their own party papers\\ngenerally purchased their elections in order to protect the great\\nmonopolies which they represent.\" Indeed, if their platforms are to be\\naccepted at face value, the Greenbackers believed that the entire\\ngovernment had passed out of the hands of the people.\\n\\n=The Grangers.=--This unsparing, not to say revolutionary, criticism of\\nAmerican political life, appealed, it seems, mainly to farmers in the\\nMiddle West. Always active in politics, they had, before the Civil War,\\ncast their lot as a rule with one or the other of the leading parties.\\nIn 1867, however, there grew up among them an association known as the\\n\"Patrons of Husbandry,\" which was destined to play a large role in the\\npartisan contests of the succeeding decades. This society, which\\norganized local lodges or \"granges\" on principles of secrecy and\\nfraternity, was originally designed to promote in a general way the\\ninterests of the farmers. Its political bearings were apparently not\\ngrasped at first by its promoters. Yet, appealing as it did to the most\\nactive and independent spirits among the farmers and gathering to itself\\nthe strength that always comes from organization, it soon found itself\\nin the hands of leaders more or less involved in politics. Where a few\\nvotes are marshaled together in a democracy, there is power.\\n\\n=The Greenback Party.=--The first extensive activity of the Grangers was\\nconnected with the attack on the railways in the Middle West which\\nforced several state legislatures to reduce freight and passenger rates\\nby law. At the same time, some leaders in the movement, no doubt\\nemboldened by this success, launched in 1876 a new political party,\\npopularly known as the Greenbackers, favoring a continued re-issue of\\nthe legal tenders. The beginnings were disappointing; but two years\\nlater, in the congressional elections, the Greenbackers swept whole\\nsections of the country. Their candidates polled more than a million\\nvotes and fourteen of them were returned to the House of\\nRepresentatives. To all outward signs a new and formidable party had\\nentered the lists.\\n\\nThe sanguine hopes of the leaders proved to be illusory. The quiet\\noperations of the resumption act the following year, a revival of\\nindustry from a severe panic which had set in during 1873, the Silver\\nPurchase Act, and the re-issue of Greenbacks cut away some of the\\ngrounds of agitation. There was also a diversion of forces to the silver\\nfaction which had a substantial support in the silver mine owners of the\\nWest. At all events the Greenback vote fell to about 300,000 in the\\nelection of 1880. A still greater drop came four years later and the\\nparty gave up the ghost, its sponsors returning to their former\\nallegiance or sulking in their tents.\\n\\n=The Rise of the Populist Party.=--Those leaders of the old parties who\\nnow looked for a happy future unvexed by new factions were doomed to\\ndisappointment. The funeral of the Greenback party was hardly over\\nbefore there arose two other political specters in the agrarian\\nsections: the National Farmers\\' Alliance and Industrial Union,\\nparticularly strong in the South and West; and the Farmers\\' Alliance,\\noperating in the North. By 1890 the two orders claimed over three\\nmillion members. As in the case of the Grangers many years before, the\\nleaders among them found an easy way into politics. In 1892 they held a\\nconvention, nominated a candidate for President, and adopted the name of\\n\"People\\'s Party,\" from which they were known as Populists. Their\\nplatform, in every line, breathed a spirit of radicalism. They declared\\nthat \"the newspapers are largely subsidized or muzzled; public opinion\\nsilenced; business prostrate; our homes covered with mortgages; and the\\nland concentrating in the hands of capitalists.... The fruits of the\\ntoil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a\\nfew.\" Having delivered this sweeping indictment, the Populists put\\nforward their remedies: the free coinage of silver, a graduated income\\ntax, postal savings banks, and government ownership of railways and\\ntelegraphs. At the same time they approved the initiative, referendum,\\nand popular election of Senators, and condemned the use of federal\\ntroops in labor disputes. On this platform, the Populists polled over a\\nmillion votes, captured twenty-two presidential electors, and sent a\\npowerful delegation to Congress.\\n\\n=Industrial Distress Augments Unrest.=--The four years intervening\\nbetween the campaign of 1892 and the next presidential election brought\\nforth many events which aggravated the ill-feeling expressed in the\\nportentous platform of Populism. Cleveland, a consistent enemy of free\\nsilver, gave his powerful support to the gold standard and insisted on\\nthe repeal of the Silver Purchase Act, thus alienating an increasing\\nnumber of his own party. In 1893 a grave industrial crisis fell upon the\\nland: banks and business houses went into bankruptcy with startling\\nrapidity; factories were closed; idle men thronged the streets hunting\\nfor work; and the prices of wheat and corn dropped to a ruinous level.\\nLabor disputes also filled the crowded record. A strike at the Pullman\\ncar works in Chicago spread to the railways. Disorders ensued. President\\nCleveland, against the protests of the governor of Illinois, John P.\\nAltgeld, dispatched troops to the scene of action. The United States\\ndistrict court at Chicago issued an injunction forbidding the president\\nof the Railway Union, Eugene V. Debs, or his assistants to interfere\\nwith the transmission of the mails or interstate commerce in any form.\\nFor refusing to obey the order, Debs was arrested and imprisoned. With\\nfederal troops in possession of the field, with their leader in jail,\\nthe strikers gave up the battle, defeated but not subdued. To cap the\\nclimax the Supreme Court of the United States, the following year (1895)\\ndeclared null and void the income tax law just enacted by Congress, thus\\nfanning the flames of Populist discontent all over the West and South.\\n\\n\\nTHE SOUND MONEY BATTLE OF 1896\\n\\n=Conservative Men Alarmed.=--Men of conservative thought and leaning in\\nboth parties were by this time thoroughly disturbed. They looked upon\\nthe rise of Populism and the growth of labor disputes as the signs of a\\nrevolutionary spirit, indeed nothing short of a menace to American\\ninstitutions and ideals. The income tax law of 1894, exclaimed the\\ndistinguished New York advocate, Joseph H. Choate, in an impassioned\\nspeech before the Supreme Court, \"is communistic in its purposes and\\ntendencies and is defended here upon principles as communistic,\\nsocialistic--what shall I call them--populistic as ever have been\\naddressed to any political assembly in the world.\" Mr. Justice Field in\\nthe name of the Court replied: \"The present assault upon capital is but\\nthe beginning. It will be but the stepping stone to others larger and\\nmore sweeping till our political conditions will become a war of the\\npoor against the rich.\" In declaring the income tax unconstitutional, he\\nbelieved that he was but averting greater evils lurking under its guise.\\nAs for free silver, nearly all conservative men were united in calling\\nit a measure of confiscation and repudiation; an effort of the debtors\\nto pay their obligations with money worth fifty cents on the dollar; the\\nclimax of villainies openly defended; a challenge to law, order, and\\nhonor.\\n\\n=The Republicans Come Out for the Gold Standard.=--It was among the\\nRepublicans that this opinion was most widely shared and firmly held. It\\nwas they who picked up the gauge thrown down by the Populists, though a\\nhost of Democrats, like Cleveland and Hill of New York, also battled\\nagainst the growing Populist defection in Democratic ranks. When the\\nRepublican national convention assembled in 1896, the die was soon\\ncast; a declaration of opposition to free silver save by international\\nagreement was carried by a vote of eight to one. The Republican party,\\nto use the vigorous language of Mr. Lodge, arrayed itself against \"not\\nonly that organized failure, the Democratic party, but all the wandering\\nforces of political chaos and social disorder ... in these bitter times\\nwhen the forces of disorder are loose and the wreckers with their false\\nlights gather at the shore to lure the ship of state upon the rocks.\"\\nYet it is due to historic truth to state that McKinley, whom the\\nRepublicans nominated, had voted in Congress for the free coinage of\\nsilver, was widely known as a bimetallist, and was only with difficulty\\npersuaded to accept the unequivocal indorsement of the gold standard\\nwhich was pressed upon him by his counselors. Having accepted it,\\nhowever, he proved to be a valiant champion, though his major interest\\nwas undoubtedly in the protective tariff. To him nothing was more\\nreprehensible than attempts \"to array class against class, \\'the classes\\nagainst the masses,\\' section against section, labor against capital,\\n\\'the poor against the rich,\\' or interest against interest.\" Such was the\\nlanguage of his acceptance speech. The whole program of Populism he now\\nviewed as a \"sudden, dangerous, and revolutionary assault upon law and\\norder.\"\\n\\n=The Democratic Convention at Chicago.=--Never, save at the great\\ndisruption on the eve of the Civil War, did a Democratic national\\nconvention display more feeling than at Chicago in 1896. From the\\nopening prayer to the last motion before the house, every act, every\\nspeech, every scene, every resolution evoked passions and sowed\\ndissensions. Departing from long party custom, it voted down in anger a\\nproposal to praise the administration of the Democratic President,\\nCleveland. When the platform with its radical planks, including free\\nsilver, was reported, a veritable storm broke. Senator Hill, trembling\\nwith emotion, protested against the departure from old tests of\\nDemocratic allegiance; against principles that must drive out of the\\nparty men who had grown gray in its service; against revolutionary,\\nunwise, and unprecedented steps in the history of the party. Senator\\nVilas of Wisconsin, in great fervor, avowed that there was no difference\\nin principle between the free coinage of silver--\"the confiscation of\\none-half of the credits of the nation for the benefit of debtors\"--and\\ncommunism itself--\"a universal distribution of property.\" In the triumph\\nof that cause he saw the beginning of \"the overthrow of all law, all\\njustice, all security and repose in the social order.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nWILLIAM J. BRYAN IN 1898]\\n\\n=The Crown of Thorns Speech.=--The champions of free silver replied in\\nstrident tones. They accused the gold advocates of being the aggressors\\nwho had assailed the labor and the homes of the people. William Jennings\\nBryan, of Nebraska, voiced their sentiments in a memorable oration. He\\ndeclared that their cause \"was as holy as the cause of liberty--the\\ncause of humanity.\" He exclaimed that the contest was between the idle\\nholders of idle capital and the toiling millions. Then he named those\\nfor whom he spoke--the wage-earner, the country lawyer, the small\\nmerchant, the farmer, and the miner. \"The man who is employed for wages\\nis as much a business man as his employer. The attorney in a country\\ntown is as much a business man as the corporation counsel in a great\\nmetropolis. The merchant at the cross roads store is as much a business\\nman as the merchant of New York. The farmer ... is as much a business\\nman as the man who goes upon the board of trade and bets upon the price\\nof grain. The miners who go a thousand feet into the earth or climb two\\nthousand feet upon the cliffs ... are as much business men as the few\\nfinancial magnates who in a back room corner the money of the world....\\nIt is for these that we speak. We do not come as aggressors. Ours is not\\na war of conquest. We are fighting in defense of our homes, our\\nfamilies, and our posterity. We have petitioned and our petitions have\\nbeen scorned. We have entreated and our entreaties have been\\ndisregarded. We have begged and they have mocked when our calamity came.\\nWe beg no longer; we entreat no more; we petition no more. We defy\\nthem.... We shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to\\nthem, \\'You shall not press upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns.\\nYou shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\\'\"\\n\\n=Bryan Nominated.=--In all the history of national conventions never had\\nan orator so completely swayed a multitude; not even Yancey in his\\nmemorable plea in the Charleston convention of 1860 when, with grave and\\nmoving eloquence, he espoused the Southern cause against the impending\\nfates. The delegates, after cheering Mr. Bryan until they could cheer no\\nmore, tore the standards from the floor and gathered around the Nebraska\\ndelegation to renew the deafening applause. The platform as reported was\\ncarried by a vote of two to one and the young orator from the West,\\nhailed as America\\'s Tiberius Gracchus, was nominated as the Democratic\\ncandidate for President. The South and West had triumphed over the East.\\nThe division was sectional, admittedly sectional--the old combination of\\npower which Calhoun had so anxiously labored to build up a century\\nearlier. The Gold Democrats were repudiated in terms which were clear to\\nall. A few, unable to endure the thought of voting the Republican\\nticket, held a convention at Indianapolis where, with the sanction of\\nCleveland, they nominated candidates of their own and endorsed the gold\\nstandard in a forlorn hope.\\n\\n=The Democratic Platform.=--It was to the call from Chicago that the\\nDemocrats gave heed and the Republicans made answer. The platform on\\nwhich Mr. Bryan stood, unlike most party manifestoes, was explicit in\\nits language and its appeal. It denounced the practice of allowing\\nnational banks to issue notes intended to circulate as money on the\\nground that it was \"in derogation of the Constitution,\" recalling\\nJackson\\'s famous attack on the Bank in 1832. It declared that tariff\\nduties should be laid \"for the purpose of revenue\"--Calhoun\\'s doctrine.\\nIn demanding the free coinage of silver, it recurred to the practice\\nabandoned in 1873. The income tax came next on the program. The platform\\nalleged that the law of 1894, passed by a Democratic Congress, was \"in\\nstrict pursuance of the uniform decisions of the Supreme Court for\\nnearly a hundred years,\" and then hinted that the decision annulling the\\nlaw might be reversed by the same body \"as it may hereafter be\\nconstituted.\"\\n\\nThe appeal to labor voiced by Mr. Bryan in his \"crown of thorns\" speech\\nwas reinforced in the platform. \"As labor creates the wealth of the\\ncountry,\" ran one plank, \"we demand the passage of such laws as may be\\nnecessary to protect it in all its rights.\" Referring to the recent\\nPullman strike, the passions of which had not yet died away, the\\nplatform denounced \"arbitrary interference by federal authorities in\\nlocal affairs as a violation of the Constitution of the United States\\nand a crime against free institutions.\" A special objection was lodged\\nagainst \"government by injunction as a new and highly dangerous form of\\noppression by which federal judges, in contempt of the laws of states\\nand rights of citizens, become at once legislators, judges, and\\nexecutioners.\" The remedy advanced was a federal law assuring trial by\\njury in all cases of contempt in labor disputes. Having made this\\ndeclaration of faith, the Democrats, with Mr. Bryan at the head, raised\\ntheir standard of battle.\\n\\n=The Heated Campaign.=--The campaign which ensued outrivaled in the\\nrange of its educational activities and the bitterness of its tone all\\nother political conflicts in American history, not excepting the fateful\\nstruggle of 1860. Immense sums of money were contributed to the funds of\\nboth parties. Railway, banking, and other corporations gave generously\\nto the Republicans; the silver miners, less lavishly but with the same\\nanxiety, supported the Democrats. The country was flooded with\\npamphlets, posters, and handbills. Every public forum, from the great\\nauditoriums of the cities to the \"red schoolhouses\" on the countryside,\\nwas occupied by the opposing forces.\\n\\nMr. Bryan took the stump himself, visiting all parts of the country in\\nspecial trains and addressing literally millions of people in the open\\nair. Mr. McKinley chose the older and more formal plan. He received\\ndelegations at his home in Canton and discussed the issues of the\\ncampaign from his front porch, leaving to an army of well-organized\\norators the task of reaching the people in their home towns. Parades,\\nprocessions, and monster demonstrations filled the land with politics.\\nWhole states were polled in advance by the Republicans and the doubtful\\nvoters personally visited by men equipped with arguments and literature.\\nManufacturers, frightened at the possibility of disordered public\\ncredit, announced that they would close their doors if the Democrats won\\nthe election. Men were dismissed from public and private places on\\naccount of their political views, one eminent college president being\\nforced out for advocating free silver. The language employed by\\nimpassioned and embittered speakers on both sides roused the public to a\\nstate of frenzy, once more showing the lengths to which men could go in\\npersonal and political abuse.\\n\\n=The Republican Victory.=--The verdict of the nation was decisive.\\nMcKinley received 271 of the 447 electoral votes, and 7,111,000 popular\\nvotes as against Bryan\\'s 6,509,000. The congressional elections were\\nequally positive although, on account of the composition of the Senate,\\nthe \"hold-over\" Democrats and Populists still enjoyed a power out of\\nproportion to their strength as measured at the polls. Even as it was,\\nthe Republicans got full control of both houses--a dominion of the\\nentire government which they were to hold for fourteen years--until the\\nsecond half of Mr. Taft\\'s administration, when they lost possession of\\nthe House of Representatives. The yoke of indecision was broken. The\\nparty of sound finance and protective tariffs set out upon its lease of\\npower with untroubled assurance.\\n\\n\\nREPUBLICAN MEASURES AND RESULTS\\n\\n=The Gold Standard and the Tariff.=--Yet strange as it may seem, the\\nRepublicans did not at once enact legislation making the gold dollar the\\nstandard for the national currency. Not until 1900 did they take that\\npositive step. In his first inaugural President McKinley, as if still\\nuncertain in his own mind or fearing a revival of the contest just\\nclosed, placed the tariff, not the money question, in the forefront.\\n\"The people have decided,\" he said, \"that such legislation should be had\\nas will give ample protection and encouragement to the industries and\\ndevelopment of our country.\" Protection for American industries,\\ntherefore, he urged, is the task before Congress. \"With adequate revenue\\nsecured, but not until then, we can enter upon changes in our fiscal\\nlaws.\" As the Republicans had only forty-six of the ninety Senators, and\\nat least four of them were known advocates of free silver, the\\ndiscretion exercised by the President in selecting the tariff for\\ncongressional debate was the better part of valor.\\n\\nCongress gave heed to the warning. Under the direction of Nelson P.\\nDingley, whose name was given to the bill, a tariff measure levying the\\nhighest rates yet laid in the history of American imposts was prepared\\nand driven through the House of Representatives. The opposition\\nencountered in the Senate, especially from the West, was overcome by\\nconcessions in favor of that section; but the duties on sugar, tin,\\nsteel, lumber, hemp, and in fact all of the essential commodities\\nhandled by combinations and trusts, were materially raised.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nPRESIDENT MCKINLEY AND HIS CABINET]\\n\\n=Growth of Combinations.=--The years that followed the enactment of the\\nDingley law were, whatever the cause, the most prosperous the country\\nhad witnessed for many a decade. Industries of every kind were soon\\nrunning full blast; labor was employed; commerce spread more swiftly\\nthan ever to the markets of the world. Coincident with this progress was\\nthe organization of the greatest combinations and trusts the world had\\nyet seen. In 1899 the smelters formed a trust with a capital of\\n$65,000,000; in the same year the Standard Oil Company with a capital of\\nover one hundred millions took the place of the old trust; and the\\nCopper Trust was incorporated under the laws of New Jersey, its par\\nvalue capital being fixed shortly afterward at $175,000,000. A year\\nlater the National Sugar Refining Company, of New Jersey, started with a\\ncapital of $90,000,000, adopting the policy of issuing to the\\nstockholders no public statement of its earnings or financial condition.\\nBefore another twelvemonth had elapsed all previous corporate financing\\nwas reduced to small proportions by the flotation of the United States\\nSteel Corporation with a capital of more than a billion dollars, an\\nenterprise set in motion by the famous Morgan banking house of New York.\\n\\nIn nearly all these gigantic undertakings, the same great leaders in\\nfinance were more or less intimately associated. To use the language of\\nan eminent authority: \"They are all allied and intertwined by their\\nvarious mutual interests. For instance, the Pennsylvania Railroad\\ninterests are on the one hand allied with the Vanderbilts and on the\\nother with the Rockefellers. The Vanderbilts are closely allied with the\\nMorgan group.... Viewed as a whole we find the dominating influences in\\nthe trusts to be made up of a network of large and small capitalists,\\nmany allied to one another by ties of more or less importance, but all\\nbeing appendages to or parts of the greater groups which are themselves\\ndependent on and allied with the two mammoth or Rockefeller and Morgan\\ngroups. These two mammoth groups jointly ... constitute the heart of the\\nbusiness and commercial life of the nation.\" Such was the picture of\\ntriumphant business enterprise drawn by a financier within a few years\\nafter the memorable campaign of 1896.\\n\\nAmerica had become one of the first workshops of the world. It was, by\\nvirtue of the closely knit organization of its business and finance, one\\nof the most powerful and energetic leaders in the struggle of the giants\\nfor the business of the earth. The capital of the Steel Corporation\\nalone was more than ten times the total national debt which the apostles\\nof calamity in the days of Washington and Hamilton declared the nation\\ncould never pay. American industry, filling domestic markets to\\noverflowing, was ready for new worlds to conquer.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nF.W. Taussig, _Tariff History of the United States_.\\n\\nJ.L.

Perhaps at this late day, it is useless to\\nprotest against the currency of the idea. Nevertheless, the truth is\\nthat from the fateful moment in March, 1775, when Edmund Burke unfolded\\nto his colleagues in the British Parliament the resources of an\\ninvincible America, down to the settlement at Versailles in 1919 closing\\nthe drama of the World War, this nation has been a world power,\\ninfluencing by its example, by its institutions, by its wealth, trade,\\nand arms the course of international affairs. And it should be said also\\nthat neither in the field of commercial enterprise nor in that of\\ndiplomacy has it been wanting in spirit or ingenuity.\\n\\nWhen John Hay, Secretary of State, heard that an American citizen,\\nPerdicaris, had been seized by Raisuli, a Moroccan bandit, in 1904, he\\nwired his brusque message: \"We want Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead.\"\\nThis was but an echo of Commodore Decatur\\'s equally characteristic\\nanswer, \"Not a minute,\" given nearly a hundred years before to the\\npirates of Algiers begging for time to consider whether they would cease\\npreying upon American merchantmen. Was it not as early as 1844 that the\\nAmerican commissioner, Caleb Cushing, taking advantage of the British\\nOpium War on China, negotiated with the Celestial Empire a successful\\ncommercial treaty? Did he not then exultantly exclaim: \"The laws of the\\nUnion follow its citizens and its banner protects them even within the\\ndomain of the Chinese Empire\"? Was it not almost half a century before\\nthe battle of Manila Bay in 1898, that Commodore Perry with an adequate\\nnaval force \"gently coerced Japan into friendship with us,\" leading all\\nthe nations of the earth in the opening of that empire to the trade of\\nthe Occident? Nor is it inappropriate in this connection to recall the\\nfact that the Monroe Doctrine celebrates in 1923 its hundredth\\nanniversary.\\n\\n\\nAMERICAN FOREIGN RELATIONS (1865-98)\\n\\n=French Intrigues in Mexico Blocked.=--Between the war for the union and\\nthe war with Spain, the Department of State had many an occasion to\\npresent the rights of America among the powers of the world. Only a\\nlittle while after the civil conflict came to a close, it was called\\nupon to deal with a dangerous situation created in Mexico by the\\nambitions of Napoleon III. During the administration of Buchanan, Mexico\\nhad fallen into disorder through the strife of the Liberal and the\\nClerical parties; the President asked for authority to use American\\ntroops to bring to a peaceful haven \"a wreck upon the ocean, drifting\\nabout as she is impelled by different factions.\" Our own domestic crisis\\nthen intervened.\\n\\nObserving the United States heavily involved in its own problems, the\\ngreat powers, England, France, and Spain, decided in the autumn of 1861\\nto take a hand themselves in restoring order in Mexico. They entered\\ninto an agreement to enforce the claims of their citizens against Mexico\\nand to protect their subjects residing in that republic. They invited\\nthe United States to join them, and, on meeting a polite refusal, they\\nprepared for a combined military and naval demonstration on their own\\naccount. In the midst of this action England and Spain, discovering the\\nsinister purposes of Napoleon, withdrew their troops and left the field\\nto him.\\n\\nThe French Emperor, it was well known, looked with jealousy upon the\\ngrowth of the United States and dreamed of establishing in the Western\\nhemisphere an imperial power to offset the American republic.\\nIntervention to collect debts was only a cloak for his deeper designs.\\nThrowing off that guise in due time, he made the Archduke Maximilian, a\\nbrother of the ruler of Austria, emperor in Mexico, and surrounded his\\nthrone by French soldiers, in spite of all protests.\\n\\nThis insolent attack upon the Mexican republic, deeply resented in the\\nUnited States, was allowed to drift in its course until 1865. At that\\njuncture General Sheridan was dispatched to the Mexican border with a\\nlarge armed force; General Grant urged the use of the American army to\\nexpel the French from this continent. The Secretary of State, Seward,\\ncounseled negotiation first, and, applying the Monroe Doctrine, was able\\nto prevail upon Napoleon III to withdraw his troops. Without the support\\nof French arms, the sham empire in Mexico collapsed like a house of\\ncards and the unhappy Maximilian, the victim of French ambition and\\nintrigue, met his death at the hands of a Mexican firing squad.\\n\\n=Alaska Purchased.=--The Mexican affair had not been brought to a close\\nbefore the Department of State was busy with negotiations which resulted\\nin the purchase of Alaska from Russia. The treaty of cession, signed on\\nMarch 30, 1867, added to the United States a domain of nearly six\\nhundred thousand square miles, a territory larger than Texas and nearly\\nthree-fourths the size of the Louisiana purchase. Though it was a\\ndistant colony separated from our continental domain by a thousand miles\\nof water, no question of \"imperialism\" or \"colonization foreign to\\nAmerican doctrines\" seems to have been raised at the time. The treaty\\nwas ratified promptly by the Senate. The purchase price, $7,200,000, was\\nvoted by the House of Representatives after the display of some\\nresentment against a system that compelled it to appropriate money to\\nfulfill an obligation which it had no part in making. Seward, who\\nformulated the treaty, rejoiced, as he afterwards said, that he had kept\\nAlaska out of the hands of England.\\n\\n=American Interest in the Caribbean.=--Having achieved this diplomatic\\ntriumph, Seward turned to the increase of American power in another\\ndirection. He negotiated, with Denmark, a treaty providing for the\\npurchase of the islands of St. John and St. Thomas in the West Indies,\\nstrategic points in the Caribbean for sea power. This project, long\\nafterward brought to fruition by other men, was defeated on this\\noccasion by the refusal of the Senate to ratify the treaty. Evidently it\\nwas not yet prepared to exercise colonial dominion over other races.\\n\\nUndaunted by the misadventure in Caribbean policies, President Grant\\nwarmly advocated the acquisition of Santo Domingo. This little republic\\nhad long been in a state of general disorder. In 1869 a treaty of\\nannexation was concluded with its president. The document Grant\\ntransmitted to the Senate with his cordial approval, only to have it\\nrejected. Not at all changed in his opinion by the outcome of his\\neffort, he continued to urge the subject of annexation. Even in his last\\nmessage to Congress he referred to it, saying that time had only proved\\nthe wisdom of his early course. The addition of Santo Domingo to the\\nAmerican sphere of protection was the work of a later generation. The\\nState Department, temporarily checked, had to bide its time.\\n\\n=The _Alabama_ Claims Arbitrated.=--Indeed, it had in hand a far more\\nserious matter, a vexing issue that grew out of Civil War diplomacy. The\\nBritish government, as already pointed out in other connections, had\\npermitted Confederate cruisers, including the famous _Alabama_, built in\\nBritish ports, to escape and prey upon the commerce of the Northern\\nstates. This action, denounced at the time by our government as a grave\\nbreach of neutrality as well as a grievous injury to American citizens,\\nled first to remonstrances and finally to repeated claims for damages\\ndone to American ships and goods. For a long time Great Britain was\\nfirm. Her foreign secretary denied all obligations in the premises,\\nadding somewhat curtly that \"he wished to say once for all that Her\\nMajesty\\'s government disclaimed any responsibility for the losses and\\nhoped that they had made their position perfectly clear.\" Still\\nPresident Grant was not persuaded that the door of diplomacy, though\\nclosed, was barred. Hamilton Fish, his Secretary of State, renewed the\\ndemand. Finally he secured from the British government in 1871 the\\ntreaty of Washington providing for the arbitration not merely of the\\n_Alabama_ and other claims but also all points of serious controversy\\nbetween the two countries.\\n\\nThe tribunal of arbitration thus authorized sat at Geneva in\\nSwitzerland, and after a long and careful review of the arguments on\\nboth sides awarded to the United States the lump sum of $15,500,000 to\\nbe distributed among the American claimants. The damages thus allowed\\nwere large, unquestionably larger than strict justice required and it is\\nnot surprising that the decision excited much adverse comment in\\nEngland. Nevertheless, the prompt payment by the British government\\nswept away at once a great cloud of ill-feeling in America. Moreover,\\nthe spectacle of two powerful nations choosing the way of peaceful\\narbitration to settle an angry dispute seemed a happy, if illusory, omen\\nof a modern method for avoiding the arbitrament of war.\\n\\n=Samoa.=--If the Senate had its doubts at first about the wisdom of\\nacquiring strategic points for naval power in distant seas, the same\\ncould not be said of the State Department or naval officers. In 1872\\nCommander Meade, of the United States navy, alive to the importance of\\ncoaling stations even in mid-ocean, made a commercial agreement with the\\nchief of Tutuila, one of the Samoan Islands, far below the equator, in\\nthe southern Pacific, nearer to Australia than to California. This\\nagreement, providing among other things for our use of the harbor of\\nPago Pago as a naval base, was six years later changed into a formal\\ntreaty ratified by the Senate.\\n\\nSuch enterprise could not escape the vigilant eyes of England and\\nGermany, both mindful of the course of the sea power in history. The\\nGerman emperor, seizing as a pretext a quarrel between his consul in the\\nislands and a native king, laid claim to an interest in the Samoan\\ngroup. England, aware of the dangers arising from German outposts in the\\nsouthern seas so near to Australia, was not content to stand aside. So\\nit happened that all three countries sent battleships to the Samoan\\nwaters, threatening a crisis that was fortunately averted by friendly\\nsettlement. If, as is alleged, Germany entertained a notion of\\nchallenging American sea power then and there, the presence of British\\nships must have dispelled that dream.\\n\\nThe result of the affair was a tripartite agreement by which the three\\npowers in 1889 undertook a protectorate over the islands. But joint\\ncontrol proved unsatisfactory. There was constant friction between the\\nGermans and the English. The spheres of authority being vague and open\\nto dispute, the plan had to be abandoned at the end of ten years.\\nEngland withdrew altogether, leaving to Germany all the islands except\\nTutuila, which was ceded outright to the United States. Thus one of the\\nfinest harbors in the Pacific, to the intense delight of the American\\nnavy, passed permanently under American dominion. Another triumph in\\ndiplomacy was set down to the credit of the State Department.\\n\\n=Cleveland and the Venezuela Affair.=--In the relations with South\\nAmerica, as well as in those with the distant Pacific, the diplomacy of\\nthe government at Washington was put to the test. For some time it had\\nbeen watching a dispute between England and Venezuela over the western\\nboundary of British Guiana and, on an appeal from Venezuela, it had\\ntaken a lively interest in the contest. In 1895 President Cleveland saw\\nthat Great Britain would yield none of her claims. After hearing the\\narguments of Venezuela, his Secretary of State, Richard T. Olney, in a\\nnote none too conciliatory, asked the British government whether it was\\nwilling to arbitrate the points in controversy. This inquiry he\\naccompanied by a warning to the effect that the United States could not\\npermit any European power to contest its mastery in this hemisphere.\\n\"The United States,\" said the Secretary, \"is practically sovereign on\\nthis continent and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it\\nconfines its interposition.... Its infinite resources, combined with its\\nisolated position, render it master of the situation and practically\\ninvulnerable against any or all other powers.\"\\n\\nThe reply evoked from the British government by this strong statement\\nwas firm and clear. The Monroe Doctrine, it said, even if not so widely\\nstretched by interpretation, was not binding in international law; the\\ndispute with Venezuela was a matter of interest merely to the parties\\ninvolved; and arbitration of the question was impossible. This response\\ncalled forth President Cleveland\\'s startling message of 1895. He asked\\nCongress to create a commission authorized to ascertain by researches\\nthe true boundary between Venezuela and British Guiana. He added that it\\nwould be the duty of this country \"to resist by every means in its\\npower, as a willful aggression upon its rights and interests, the\\nappropriation by Great Britain of any lands or the exercise of\\ngovernmental jurisdiction over any territory which, after investigation,\\nwe have determined of right belongs to Venezuela.\" The serious character\\nof this statement he thoroughly understood. He declared that he was\\nconscious of his responsibilities, intimating that war, much as it was\\nto be deplored, was not comparable to \"a supine submission to wrong and\\ninjustice and the consequent loss of national self-respect and honor.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: GROVER CLEVELAND]\\n\\nThe note of defiance which ran through this message, greeted by shrill\\ncries of enthusiasm in many circles, was viewed in other quarters as a\\nportent of war. Responsible newspapers in both countries spoke of an\\narmed settlement of the dispute as inevitable. Congress created the\\ncommission and appropriated money for the investigation; a body of\\nlearned men was appointed to determine the merits of the conflicting\\nboundary claims. The British government, deaf to the clamor of the\\nbellicose section of the London press, deplored the incident,\\ncourteously replied in the affirmative to a request for assistance in\\nthe search for evidence, and finally agreed to the proposition that the\\nissue be submitted to arbitration. The outcome of this somewhat perilous\\ndispute contributed not a little to Cleveland\\'s reputation as \"a\\nsterling representative of the true American spirit.\" This was not\\ndiminished when the tribunal of arbitration found that Great Britain was\\non the whole right in her territorial claims against Venezuela.\\n\\n=The Annexation of Hawaii.=--While engaged in the dangerous Venezuela\\ncontroversy, President Cleveland was compelled by a strange turn in\\nevents to consider the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands in the\\nmid-Pacific. For more than half a century American missionaries had been\\nactive in converting the natives to the Christian faith and enterprising\\nAmerican business men had been developing the fertile sugar plantations.\\nBoth the Department of State and the Navy Department were fully\\nconscious of the strategic relation of the islands to the growth of sea\\npower and watched with anxiety any developments likely to bring them\\nunder some other Dominion.\\n\\nThe country at large was indifferent, however, until 1893, when a\\nrevolution, headed by Americans, broke out, ending in the overthrow of\\nthe native government, the abolition of the primitive monarchy, and the\\nretirement of Queen Liliuokalani to private life. This crisis, a\\nrepetition of the Texas affair in a small theater, was immediately\\nfollowed by a demand from the new Hawaiian government for annexation to\\nthe United States. President Harrison looked with favor on the proposal,\\nnegotiated the treaty of annexation, and laid it before the Senate for\\napproval. There it still rested when his term of office was brought to a\\nclose.\\n\\nHarrison\\'s successor, Cleveland, it was well known, had doubts about the\\npropriety of American action in Hawaii. For the purpose of making an\\ninquiry into the matter, he sent a special commissioner to the islands.\\nOn the basis of the report of his agent, Cleveland came to the\\nconclusion that \"the revolution in the island kingdom had been\\naccomplished by the improper use of the armed forces of the United\\nStates and that the wrong should be righted by a restoration of the\\nqueen to her throne.\" Such being his matured conviction, though the\\nfacts upon which he rested it were warmly controverted, he could do\\nnothing but withdraw the treaty from the Senate and close the incident.\\n\\nTo the Republicans this sharp and cavalier disposal of their plans,\\ncarried out in a way that impugned the motives of a Republican\\nPresident, was nothing less than \"a betrayal of American interests.\" In\\ntheir platform of 1896 they made clear their position: \"Our foreign\\npolicy should be at all times firm, vigorous, and dignified and all our\\ninterests in the Western hemisphere carefully watched and guarded. The\\nHawaiian Islands should be controlled by the United States and no\\nforeign power should be permitted to interfere with them.\" There was no\\nmistaking this view of the issue. As the vote in the election gave\\npopular sanction to Republican policies, Congress by a joint resolution,\\npassed on July 6, 1898, annexed the islands to the United States and\\nlater conferred upon them the ordinary territorial form of government.\\n\\n\\nCUBA AND THE SPANISH WAR\\n\\n=Early American Relations with Cuba.=--The year that brought Hawaii\\nfinally under the American flag likewise drew to a conclusion another\\nlong controversy over a similar outpost in the Atlantic, one of the last\\nremnants of the once glorious Spanish empire--the island of Cuba.\\n\\nFor a century the Department of State had kept an anxious eye upon this\\nbase of power, knowing full well that both France and England, already\\nwell established in the West Indies, had their attention also fixed upon\\nCuba. In the administration of President Fillmore they had united in\\nproposing to the United States a tripartite treaty guaranteeing Spain in\\nher none too certain ownership. This proposal, squarely rejected,\\nfurnished the occasion for a statement of American policy which stood\\nthe test of all the years that followed; namely, that the affair was one\\nbetween Spain and the United States alone.\\n\\nIn that long contest in the United States for the balance of power\\nbetween the North and South, leaders in the latter section often thought\\nof bringing Cuba into the union to offset the free states. An\\nopportunity to announce their purposes publicly was afforded in 1854 by\\na controversy over the seizure of an American ship by Cuban authorities.\\nOn that occasion three American ministers abroad, stationed at Madrid,\\nParis, and London respectively, held a conference and issued the\\ncelebrated \"Ostend Manifesto.\" They united in declaring that Cuba, by\\nher geographical position, formed a part of the United States, that\\npossession by a foreign power was inimical to American interests, and\\nthat an effort should be made to purchase the island from Spain. In case\\nthe owner refused to sell, they concluded, with a menacing flourish, \"by\\nevery law, human and divine, we shall be justified in wresting it from\\nSpain if we possess the power.\" This startling proclamation to the world\\nwas promptly disowned by the United States government.\\n\\n[Illustration: _=An old cartoon.=_\\n\\nA SIGHT TOO BAD\\n\\n_Struggling Cuba._ \"You must be awfully near-sighted, Mr. President, not\\nto recognize me.\" _U.S.G._ \"No, I am far-sighted: for I can recognize\\nFrance.\"]\\n\\n=Revolutions in Cuba.=--For nearly twenty years afterwards the Cuban\\nquestion rested. Then it was revived in another form during President\\nGrant\\'s administrations, when the natives became engaged in a\\ndestructive revolt against Spanish officials. For ten years--1868-78--a\\nguerrilla warfare raged in the island. American citizens, by virtue of\\ntheir ancient traditions of democracy, naturally sympathized with a war\\nfor independence and self-government. Expeditions to help the insurgents\\nwere fitted out secretly in American ports. Arms and supplies were\\nsmuggled into Cuba. American soldiers of fortune joined their ranks. The\\nenforcement of neutrality against the friends of Cuban independence, no\\npleasing task for a sympathetic President, the protection of American\\nlives and property in the revolutionary area, and similar matters kept\\nour government busy with Cuba for a whole decade.\\n\\nA brief lull in Cuban disorders was followed in 1895 by a renewal of the\\nrevolutionary movement. The contest between the rebels and the Spanish\\ntroops, marked by extreme cruelty and a total disregard for life and\\nproperty, exceeded all bounds of decency, and once more raised the old\\nquestions that had tormented Grant\\'s administration. Gomez, the leader\\nof the revolt, intent upon provoking American interference, laid waste\\nthe land with fire and sword. By a proclamation of November 6, 1895, he\\nordered the destruction of sugar plantations and railway connections and\\nthe closure of all sugar factories. The work of ruin was completed by\\nthe ruthless Spanish general, Weyler, who concentrated the inhabitants\\nfrom rural regions into military camps, where they died by the hundreds\\nof disease and starvation. Stories of the atrocities, bad enough in\\nsimple form, became lurid when transmuted into American news and deeply\\nmoved the sympathies of the American people. Sermons were preached about\\nSpanish misdeeds; orators demanded that the Cubans be sustained \"in\\ntheir heroic struggle for independence\"; newspapers, scouting the\\nordinary forms of diplomatic negotiation, spurned mediation and demanded\\nintervention and war if necessary.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nCUBAN REVOLUTIONISTS]\\n\\n=President Cleveland\\'s Policy.=--Cleveland chose the way of peace. He\\nordered the observance of the rule of neutrality. He declined to act on\\na resolution of Congress in favor of giving to the Cubans the rights of\\nbelligerents. Anxious to bring order to the distracted island, he\\ntendered to Spain the good offices of the United States as mediator in\\nthe contest--a tender rejected by the Spanish government with the broad\\nhint that President Cleveland might be more vigorous in putting a stop\\nto the unlawful aid in money, arms, and supplies, afforded to the\\ninsurgents by American sympathizers. Thereupon the President returned to\\nthe course he had marked out for himself, leaving \"the public nuisance\"\\nto his successor, President McKinley.\\n\\n=Republican Policies.=--The Republicans in 1897 found themselves in a\\nposition to employ that \"firm, vigorous, and dignified\" foreign policy\\nwhich they had approved in their platform. They had declared: \"The\\ngovernment of Spain having lost control of Cuba and being unable to\\n\\nprotect the property or lives of resident American citizens or to comply\\nwith its treaty obligations, we believe that the government of the\\nUnited States should actively use its influence and good offices to\\nrestore peace and give independence to the island.\" The American\\nproperty in Cuba to which the Republicans referred in their platform\\namounted by this time to more than fifty million dollars; the commerce\\nwith the island reached more than one hundred millions annually; and the\\nclaims of American citizens against Spain for property destroyed totaled\\nsixteen millions. To the pleas of humanity which made such an effective\\nappeal to the hearts of the American people, there were thus added\\npractical considerations of great weight.\\n\\n=President McKinley Negotiates.=--In the face of the swelling tide of\\npopular opinion in favor of quick, drastic, and positive action,\\nMcKinley chose first the way of diplomacy. A short time after his\\ninauguration he lodged with the Spanish government a dignified protest\\nagainst its policies in Cuba, thus opening a game of thrust and parry\\nwith the suave ministers at Madrid. The results of the exchange of\\nnotes were the recall of the obnoxious General Weyler, the appointment\\nof a governor-general less bloodthirsty in his methods, a change in the\\npolicy of concentrating civilians in military camps, and finally a\\npromise of \"home rule\" for Cuba. There is no doubt that the Spanish\\ngovernment was eager to avoid a war that could have but one outcome. The\\nAmerican minister at Madrid, General Woodford, was convinced that firm\\nand patient pressure would have resulted in the final surrender of Cuba\\nby the Spanish government.\\n\\n=The De Lome and the _Maine_ Incidents.=--Such a policy was defeated by\\nevents. In February, 1898, a private letter written by Senor de Lome,\\nthe Spanish ambassador at Washington, expressing contempt for the\\nPresident of the United States, was filched from the mails and passed\\ninto the hands of a journalist, William R. Hearst, who published it to\\nthe world. In the excited state of American opinion, few gave heed to\\nthe grave breach of diplomatic courtesy committed by breaking open\\nprivate correspondence. The Spanish government was compelled to recall\\nDe Lome, thus officially condemning his conduct.\\n\\nAt this point a far more serious crisis put the pacific relations of the\\ntwo negotiating countries in dire peril. On February 15, the battleship\\n_Maine_, riding in the harbor of Havana, was blown up and sunk, carrying\\nto death two officers and two hundred and fifty-eight members of the\\ncrew. This tragedy, ascribed by the American public to the malevolence\\nof Spanish officials, profoundly stirred an already furious nation.\\nWhen, on March 21, a commission of inquiry reported that the ill-fated\\nship had been blown up by a submarine mine which had in turn set off\\nsome of the ship\\'s magazines, the worst suspicions seemed confirmed. If\\nany one was inclined to be indifferent to the Cuban war for\\nindependence, he was now met by the vehement cry: \"Remember the\\n_Maine_!\"\\n\\n=Spanish Concessions.=--Still the State Department, under McKinley\\'s\\nsteady hand, pursued the path of negotiation, Spain proving more pliable\\nand more ready with promises of reform in the island. Early in April,\\nhowever, there came a decided change in the tenor of American diplomacy.\\nOn the 4th, McKinley, evidently convinced that promises did not mean\\nperformances, instructed our minister at Madrid to warn the Spanish\\ngovernment that as no effective armistice had been offered to the\\nCubans, he would lay the whole matter before Congress. This decision,\\nevery one knew, from the temper of Congress, meant war--a prospect which\\nexcited all the European powers. The Pope took an active interest in the\\ncrisis. France and Germany, foreseeing from long experience in world\\npolitics an increase of American power and prestige through war, sought\\nto prevent it. Spain, hopeless and conscious of her weakness, at last\\ndispatched to the President a note promising to suspend hostilities, to\\ncall a Cuban parliament, and to grant all the autonomy that could be\\nreasonably asked.\\n\\n=President McKinley Calls for War.=--For reasons of his own--reasons\\nwhich have never yet been fully explained--McKinley ignored the final\\nprogram of concessions presented by Spain. At the very moment when his\\npatient negotiations seemed to bear full fruit, he veered sharply from\\nhis course and launched the country into the war by sending to Congress\\nhis militant message of April 11, 1898. Without making public the last\\nnote he had received from Spain, he declared that he was brought to the\\nend of his effort and the cause was in the hands of Congress. Humanity,\\nthe protection of American citizens and property, the injuries to\\nAmerican commerce and business, the inability of Spain to bring about\\npermanent peace in the island--these were the grounds for action that\\ninduced him to ask for authority to employ military and naval forces in\\nestablishing a stable government in Cuba. They were sufficient for a\\npublic already straining at the leash.\\n\\n=The Resolution of Congress.=--There was no doubt of the outcome when\\nthe issue was withdrawn from diplomacy and placed in charge of Congress.\\nResolutions were soon introduced into the House of Representatives\\nauthorizing the President to employ armed force in securing peace and\\norder in the island and \"establishing by the free action of the people\\nthereof a stable and independent government of their own.\" To the form\\nand spirit of this proposal the Democrats and Populists took exception.\\nIn the Senate, where they were stronger, their position had to be\\nreckoned with by the narrow Republican majority. As the resolution\\nfinally read, the independence of Cuba was recognized; Spain was called\\nupon to relinquish her authority and withdraw from the island; and the\\nPresident was empowered to use force to the extent necessary to carry\\nthe resolutions into effect. Furthermore the United States disclaimed\\n\"any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or\\ncontrol over said island except for the pacification thereof.\" Final\\naction was taken by Congress on April 19, 1898, and approved by the\\nPresident on the following day.\\n\\n=War and Victory.=--Startling events then followed in swift succession.\\nThe navy, as a result in no small measure of the alertness of Theodore\\nRoosevelt, Assistant Secretary of the Department, was ready for the\\ntrial by battle. On May 1, Commodore Dewey at Manila Bay shattered the\\nSpanish fleet, marking the doom of Spanish dominion in the Philippines.\\nOn July 3, the Spanish fleet under Admiral Cervera, in attempting to\\nescape from Havana, was utterly destroyed by American forces under\\nCommodore Schley. On July 17, Santiago, invested by American troops\\nunder General Shafter and shelled by the American ships, gave up the\\nstruggle. On July 25 General Miles landed in Porto Rico. On August 13,\\nGeneral Merritt and Admiral Dewey carried Manila by storm. The war was\\nover.\\n\\n=The Peace Protocol.=--Spain had already taken cognizance of stern\\nfacts. As early as July 26, 1898, acting through the French ambassador,\\nM. Cambon, the Madrid government approached President McKinley for a\\nstatement of the terms on which hostilities could be brought to a close.\\nAfter some skirmishing Spain yielded reluctantly to the ultimatum. On\\nAugust 12, the preliminary peace protocol was signed, stipulating that\\nCuba should be free, Porto Rico ceded to the United States, and Manila\\noccupied by American troops pending the formal treaty of peace. On\\nOctober 1, the commissioners of the two countries met at Paris to bring\\nabout the final settlement.\\n\\n=Peace Negotiations.=--When the day for the first session of the\\nconference arrived, the government at Washington apparently had not made\\nup its mind on the final disposition of the Philippines. Perhaps, before\\nthe battle of Manila Bay, not ten thousand people in the United States\\nknew or cared where the Philippines were. Certainly there was in the\\nautumn of 1898 no decided opinion as to what should be done with the\\nfruits of Dewey\\'s victory. President McKinley doubtless voiced the\\nsentiment of the people when he stated to the peace commissioners on the\\neve of their departure that there had originally been no thought of\\nconquest in the Pacific.\\n\\nThe march of events, he added, had imposed new duties on the country.\\n\"Incidental to our tenure in the Philippines,\" he said, \"is the\\ncommercial opportunity to which American statesmanship cannot be\\nindifferent. It is just to use every legitimate means for the\\nenlargement of American trade.\" On this ground he directed the\\ncommissioners to accept not less than the cession of the island of\\nLuzon, the chief of the Philippine group, with its harbor of Manila. It\\nwas not until the latter part of October that he definitely instructed\\nthem to demand the entire archipelago, on the theory that the occupation\\nof Luzon alone could not be justified \"on political, commercial, or\\nhumanitarian grounds.\" This departure from the letter of the peace\\nprotocol was bitterly resented by the Spanish agents. It was with\\nheaviness of heart that they surrendered the last sign of Spain\\'s\\nancient dominion in the far Pacific.\\n\\n=The Final Terms of Peace.=--The treaty of peace, as finally agreed\\nupon, embraced the following terms: the independence of Cuba; the\\ncession of Porto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States;\\nthe settlement of claims filed by the citizens of both countries; the\\npayment of twenty million dollars to Spain by the United States for the\\nPhilippines; and the determination of the status of the inhabitants of\\nthe ceded territories by Congress. The great decision had been made. Its\\nissue was in the hands of the Senate where the Democrats and the\\nPopulists held the balance of power under the requirement of the\\ntwo-thirds vote for ratification.\\n\\n=The Contest in America over the Treaty of Peace.=--The publication of\\nthe treaty committing the United States to the administration of distant\\ncolonies directed the shifting tides of public opinion into two distinct\\nchannels: support of the policy and opposition to it. The trend in\\nRepublican leadership, long in the direction marked out by the treaty,\\nnow came into the open. Perhaps a majority of the men highest in the\\ncouncils of that party had undergone the change of heart reflected in\\nthe letters of John Hay, Secretary of State. In August of 1898 he had\\nhinted, in a friendly letter to Andrew Carnegie, that he sympathized\\nwith the latter\\'s opposition to \"imperialism\"; but he had added quickly:\\n\"The only question in my mind is how far it is now possible for us to\\nwithdraw from the Philippines.\" In November of the same year he wrote to\\nWhitelaw Reid, one of the peace commissioners at Paris: \"There is a wild\\nand frantic attack now going on in the press against the whole\\nPhilippine transaction. Andrew Carnegie really seems to be off his\\nhead.... But all this confusion of tongues will go its way. The country\\nwill applaud the resolution that has been reached and you will return in\\nthe role of conquering heroes with your \\'brows bound with oak.\\'\"\\n\\nSenator Beveridge of Indiana and Senator Platt of Connecticut, accepting\\nthe verdict of history as the proof of manifest destiny, called for\\nunquestioning support of the administration in its final step. \"Every\\nexpansion of our territory,\" said the latter, \"has been in accordance\\nwith the irresistible law of growth. We could no more resist the\\nsuccessive expansions by which we have grown to be the strongest nation\\non earth than a tree can resist its growth. The history of territorial\\nexpansion is the history of our nation\\'s progress and glory. It is a\\nmatter to be proud of, not to lament. We should rejoice that Providence\\nhas given us the opportunity to extend our influence, our institutions,\\nand our civilization into regions hitherto closed to us, rather than\\ncontrive how we can thwart its designs.\"\\n\\nThis doctrine was savagely attacked by opponents of McKinley\\'s policy,\\nmany a stanch Republican joining with the majority of Democrats in\\ndenouncing the treaty as a departure from the ideals of the republic.\\nSenator Vest introduced in the Senate a resolution that \"under the\\nConstitution of the United States, no power is given to the federal\\nGovernment to acquire territory to be held and governed permanently as\\ncolonies.\" Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, whose long and honorable\\ncareer gave weight to his lightest words, inveighed against the whole\\nprocedure and to the end of his days believed that the new drift into\\nrivalry with European nations as a colonial power was fraught with\\ngenuine danger. \"Our imperialistic friends,\" he said, \"seem to have\\nforgotten the use of the vocabulary of liberty. They talk about giving\\ngood government. \\'We shall give them such a government as we think they\\nare fitted for.\\' \\'We shall give them a better government than they had\\nbefore.\\' Why, Mr. President, that one phrase conveys to a free man and a\\nfree people the most stinging of insults. In that little phrase, as in a\\nseed, is contained the germ of all despotism and of all tyranny.\\nGovernment is not a gift. Free government is not to be given by all the\\nblended powers of earth and heaven. It is a birthright. It belongs, as\\nour fathers said, and as their children said, as Jefferson said, and as\\nPresident McKinley said, to human nature itself.\"\\n\\nThe Senate, more conservative on the question of annexation than the\\nHouse of Representatives composed of men freshly elected in the stirring\\ncampaign of 1896, was deliberate about ratification of the treaty. The\\nDemocrats and Populists were especially recalcitrant. Mr. Bryan hurried\\nto Washington and brought his personal influence to bear in favor of\\nspeedy action. Patriotism required ratification, it was said in one\\nquarter. The country desires peace and the Senate ought not to delay, it\\nwas urged in another. Finally, on February 6, 1899, the requisite\\nmajority of two-thirds was mustered, many a Senator who voted for the\\ntreaty, however, sharing the misgivings of Senator Hoar as to the\\n\"dangers of imperialism.\" Indeed at the time, the Senators passed a\\nresolution declaring that the policy to be adopted in the Philippines\\nwas still an open question, leaving to the future, in this way, the\\npossibility of retracing their steps.\\n\\n=The Attitude of England.=--The Spanish war, while accomplishing the\\nsimple objects of those who launched the nation on that course, like all\\nother wars, produced results wholly unforeseen. In the first place, it\\nexercised a profound influence on the drift of opinion among European\\npowers. In England, sympathy with the United States was from the first\\npositive and outspoken. \"The state of feeling here,\" wrote Mr. Hay, then\\nambassador in London, \"is the best I have ever known. From every quarter\\nthe evidences of it come to me. The royal family by habit and tradition\\nare most careful not to break the rules of strict neutrality, but even\\namong them I find nothing but hearty kindness and--so far as is\\nconsistent with propriety--sympathy. Among the political leaders on both\\nsides I find not only sympathy but a somewhat eager desire that \\'the\\nother fellows\\' shall not seem more friendly.\"\\n\\nJoseph Chamberlain, the distinguished Liberal statesman, thinking no\\ndoubt of the continental situation, said in a political address at the\\nvery opening of the war that the next duty of Englishmen \"is to\\nestablish and maintain bonds of permanent unity with our kinsmen across\\nthe Atlantic.... I even go so far as to say that, terrible as war may\\nbe, even war would be cheaply purchased if, in a great and noble cause,\\nthe Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack should wave together over an\\nAnglo-Saxon alliance.\" To the American ambassador he added\\nsignificantly that he did not \"care a hang what they say about it on the\\ncontinent,\" which was another way of expressing the hope that the\\nwarning to Germany and France was sufficient. This friendly English\\nopinion, so useful to the United States when a combination of powers to\\nsupport Spain was more than possible, removed all fears as to the\\nconsequences of the war. Henry Adams, recalling days of humiliation in\\nLondon during the Civil War, when his father was the American\\nambassador, coolly remarked that it was \"the sudden appearance of\\nGermany as the grizzly terror\" that \"frightened England into America\\'s\\narms\"; but the net result in keeping the field free for an easy triumph\\nof American arms was none the less appreciated in Washington where,\\ndespite outward calm, fears of European complications were never absent.\\n\\n\\nAMERICAN POLICIES IN THE PHILIPPINES AND THE ORIENT\\n\\n=The Filipino Revolt against American Rule.=--In the sphere of domestic\\npolitics, as well as in the field of foreign relations, the outcome of\\nthe Spanish war exercised a marked influence. It introduced at once\\nproblems of colonial administration and difficulties in adjusting trade\\nrelations with the outlying dominions. These were furthermore\\ncomplicated in the very beginning by the outbreak of an insurrection\\nagainst American sovereignty in the Philippines. The leader of the\\nrevolt, Aguinaldo, had been invited to join the American forces in\\noverthrowing Spanish dominion, and he had assumed, apparently without\\nwarrant, that independence would be the result of the joint operations.\\nWhen the news reached him that the American flag had been substituted\\nfor the Spanish flag, his resentment was keen. In February, 1899, there\\noccurred a slight collision between his men and some American soldiers.\\nThe conflict thus begun was followed by serious fighting which finally\\ndwindled into a vexatious guerrilla warfare lasting three years and\\ncosting heavily in men and money. Atrocities were committed by the\\nnative insurrectionists and, sad to relate, they were repaid in kind;\\nit was argued in defense of the army that the ordinary rules of warfare\\nwere without terror to men accustomed to fighting like savages. In vain\\ndid McKinley assure the Filipinos that the institutions and laws\\nestablished in the islands would be designed \"not for our satisfaction\\nor for the expression of our theoretical views, but for the happiness,\\npeace, and prosperity of the people of the Philippine Islands.\" Nothing\\nshort of military pressure could bring the warring revolutionists to\\nterms.\\n\\n=Attacks on Republican \"Imperialism.\"=--The Filipino insurrection,\\nfollowing so quickly upon the ratification of the treaty with Spain,\\nmoved the American opponents of McKinley\\'s colonial policies to redouble\\ntheir denunciation of what they were pleased to call \"imperialism.\"\\nSenator Hoar was more than usually caustic in his indictment of the new\\ncourse. The revolt against American rule did but convince him of the\\nfolly hidden in the first fateful measures. Everywhere he saw a\\nconspiracy of silence and injustice. \"I have failed to discover in the\\nspeeches, public or private, of the advocates of this war,\" he contended\\nin the Senate, \"or in the press which supports it and them, a single\\nexpression anywhere of a desire to do justice to the people of the\\nPhilippine Islands, or of a desire to make known to the people of the\\nUnited States the truth of the case.... The catchwords, the cries, the\\npithy and pregnant phrases of which their speech is full, all mean\\ndominion. They mean perpetual dominion.... There is not one of these\\ngentlemen who will rise in his place and affirm that if he were a\\nFilipino he would not do exactly as the Filipinos are doing; that he\\nwould not despise them if they were to do otherwise. So much at least\\nthey owe of respect to the dead and buried history--the dead and buried\\nhistory so far as they can slay and bury it--of their country.\" In the\\nway of practical suggestions, the Senator offered as a solution of the\\nproblem: the recognition of independence, assistance in establishing\\nself-government, and an invitation to all powers to join in a guarantee\\nof freedom to the islands.\\n\\n=The Republican Answer.=--To McKinley and his supporters, engaged in a\\nsanguinary struggle to maintain American supremacy, such talk was more\\nthan quixotic; it was scarcely short of treasonable. They pointed out\\nthe practical obstacles in the way of uniform self-government for a\\ncollection of seven million people ranging in civilization from the most\\nignorant hill men to the highly cultivated inhabitants of Manila. The\\nincidents of the revolt and its repression, they admitted, were painful\\nenough; but still nothing as compared with the chaos that would follow\\nthe attempt of a people who had never had experience in such matters to\\nset up and sustain democratic institutions. They preferred rather the\\ngradual process of fitting the inhabitants of the islands for\\nself-government. This course, in their eyes, though less poetic, was\\nmore in harmony with the ideals of humanity. Having set out upon it,\\nthey pursued it steadfastly to the end. First, they applied force\\nwithout stint to the suppression of the revolt. Then they devoted such\\ngenius for colonial administration as they could command to the\\ndevelopment of civil government, commerce, and industry.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nA PHILIPPINE HOME]\\n\\n=The Boxer Rebellion in China.=--For a nation with a world-wide trade,\\nsteadily growing, as the progress of home industries redoubled the zeal\\nfor new markets, isolation was obviously impossible. Never was this\\nclearer than in 1900 when a native revolt against foreigners in China,\\nknown as the Boxer uprising, compelled the United States to join with\\nthe powers of Europe in a military expedition and a diplomatic\\nsettlement. The Boxers, a Chinese association, had for some time carried\\non a campaign of hatred against all aliens in the Celestial empire,\\ncalling upon the natives to rise in patriotic wrath and drive out the\\nforeigners who, they said, \"were lacerating China like tigers.\" In the\\nsummer of 1900 the revolt flamed up in deeds of cruelty. Missionaries\\nand traders were murdered in the provinces; foreign legations were\\nstoned; the German ambassador, one of the most cordially despised\\nforeigners, was killed in the streets of Peking; and to all appearances\\na frightful war of extermination had begun. In the month of June nearly\\nfive hundred men, women, and children, representing all nations, were\\nbesieged in the British quarters in Peking under constant fire of\\nChinese guns and in peril of a terrible death.\\n\\n=Intervention in China.=--Nothing but the arrival of armed forces, made\\nup of Japanese, Russian, British, American, French, and German soldiers\\nand marines, prevented the destruction of the beleaguered aliens. When\\nonce the foreign troops were in possession of the Chinese capital,\\ndiplomatic questions of the most delicate character arose. For more than\\nhalf a century, the imperial powers of Europe had been carving up the\\nChinese empire, taking to themselves territory, railway concessions,\\nmining rights, ports, and commercial privileges at the expense of the\\nhuge but helpless victim. The United States alone among the great\\nnations, while as zealous as any in the pursuit of peaceful trade, had\\nrefrained from seizing Chinese territory or ports. Moreover, the\\nDepartment of State had been urging European countries to treat China\\nwith fairness, to respect her territorial integrity, and to give her\\nequal trading privileges with all nations.\\n\\n=The American Policy of the \"Open Door.\"=--In the autumn of 1899,\\nSecretary Hay had addressed to London, Berlin, Rome, Paris, Tokyo, and\\nSt. Petersburg his famous note on the \"open door\" policy in China. In\\nthis document he proposed that existing treaty ports and vested\\ninterests of the several foreign countries should be respected; that\\nthe Chinese government should be permitted to extend its tariffs to all\\nports held by alien powers except the few free ports; and that there\\nshould be no discrimination in railway and port charges among the\\ncitizens of foreign countries operating in the empire. To these\\nprinciples the governments addressed by Mr. Hay, finally acceded with\\nevident reluctance.\\n\\n[Illustration: AMERICAN DOMINIONS IN THE PACIFIC]\\n\\nOn this basis he then proposed the settlement that had to follow the\\nBoxer uprising. \"The policy of the Government of the United States,\" he\\nsaid to the great powers, in the summer of 1900, \"is to seek a solution\\nwhich may bring about permanent safety and peace to China, preserve\\nChinese territorial and administrative entity, protect all rights\\nguaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and international law, and\\nsafeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with\\nall parts of the Chinese empire.\" This was a friendly warning to the\\nworld that the United States would not join in a scramble to punish the\\nChinese by carving out more territory. \"The moment we acted,\" said Mr.\\nHay, \"the rest of the world paused and finally came over to our ground;\\nand the German government, which is generally brutal but seldom silly,\\nrecovered its senses, and climbed down off its perch.\"\\n\\nIn taking this position, the Secretary of State did but reflect the\\ncommon sense of America. \"We are, of course,\" he explained, \"opposed to\\nthe dismemberment of that empire and we do not think that the public\\nopinion of the United States would justify this government in taking\\npart in the great game of spoliation now going on.\" Heavy damages were\\ncollected by the European powers from China for the injuries inflicted\\nupon their citizens by the Boxers; but the United States, finding the\\nsum awarded in excess of the legitimate claims, returned the balance in\\nthe form of a fund to be applied to the education of Chinese students in\\nAmerican universities. \"I would rather be, I think,\" said Mr. Hay, \"the\\ndupe of China than the chum of the Kaiser.\" By pursuing a liberal\\npolicy, he strengthened the hold of the United States upon the\\naffections of the Chinese people and, in the long run, as he remarked\\nhimself, safeguarded \"our great commercial interests in that Empire.\"\\n\\n=Imperialism in the Presidential Campaign of 1900.=--It is not strange\\nthat the policy pursued by the Republican administration in disposing of\\nthe questions raised by the Spanish War became one of the first issues\\nin the presidential campaign of 1900. Anticipating attacks from every\\nquarter, the Republicans, in renominating McKinley, set forth their\\nposition in clear and ringing phrases: \"In accepting by the treaty of\\nParis the just responsibility of our victories in the Spanish War the\\nPresident and Senate won the undoubted approval of the American people.\\nNo other course was possible than to destroy Spain\\'s sovereignty\\nthroughout the West Indies and in the Philippine Islands. That course\\ncreated our responsibility, before the world and with the unorganized\\npopulation whom our intervention had freed from Spain, to provide for\\nthe maintenance of law and order, and for the establishment of good\\ngovernment and for the performance of international obligations. Our\\nauthority could not be less than our responsibility, and wherever\\nsovereign rights were extended it became the high duty of the government\\nto maintain its authority, to put down armed insurrection, and to confer\\nthe blessings of liberty and civilization upon all the rescued peoples.\\nThe largest measure of self-government consistent with their welfare and\\nour duties shall be secured to them by law.\" To give more strength to\\ntheir ticket, the Republican convention, in a whirlwind of enthusiasm,\\nnominated for the vice presidency, against his protest, Theodore\\nRoosevelt, the governor of New York and the hero of the Rough Riders, so\\npopular on account of their Cuban campaign.\\n\\nThe Democrats, as expected, picked up the gauntlet thrown down with such\\ndefiance by the Republicans. Mr. Bryan, whom they selected as their\\ncandidate, still clung to the currency issue; but the main emphasis,\\nboth of the platform and the appeal for votes, was on the \"imperialistic\\nprogram\" of the Republican administration. The Democrats denounced the\\ntreatment of Cuba and Porto Rico and condemned the Philippine policy in\\nsharp and vigorous terms. \"As we are not willing,\" ran the platform, \"to\\nsurrender our civilization or to convert the Republic into an empire, we\\nfavor an immediate declaration of the Nation\\'s purpose to give to the\\nFilipinos, first, a stable form of government; second, independence;\\nthird, protection from outside interference.... The greedy commercialism\\nwhich dictated the Philippine policy of the Republican administration\\nattempts to justify it with the plea that it will pay, but even this\\nsordid and unworthy plea fails when brought to the test of facts. The\\nwar of \\'criminal aggression\\' against the Filipinos entailing an annual\\nexpense of many millions has already cost more than any possible profit\\nthat could accrue from the entire Philippine trade for years to come....\\nWe oppose militarism. It means conquest abroad and intimidation and\\noppression at home. It means the strong arm which has ever been fatal to\\nfree institutions. It is what millions of our citizens have fled from in\\nEurope. It will impose upon our peace-loving people a large standing\\narmy, an unnecessary burden of taxation, and would be a constant menace\\nto their liberties.\" Such was the tenor of their appeal to the voters.\\n\\nWith the issues clearly joined, the country rejected the Democratic\\ncandidate even more positively than four years before. The popular vote\\ncast for McKinley was larger and that cast for Bryan smaller than in the\\nsilver election. Thus vindicated at the polls, McKinley turned with\\nrenewed confidence to the development of the policies he had so far\\nadvanced. But fate cut short his designs. In the September following his\\nsecond inauguration, he was shot by an anarchist while attending the\\nBuffalo exposition. \"What a strange and tragic fate it has been of\\nmine,\" wrote the Secretary of State, John Hay, on the day of the\\nPresident\\'s death, \"to stand by the bier of three of my dearest friends,\\nLincoln, Garfield, and McKinley, three of the gentlest of men, all risen\\nto the head of the state and all done to death by assassins.\" On\\nSeptember 14, 1901, the Vice President, Theodore Roosevelt, took up the\\nlines of power that had fallen from the hands of his distinguished\\nchief, promising to continue \"absolutely unbroken\" the policies he had\\ninherited.\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY OF NATIONAL GROWTH AND WORLD POLITICS\\n\\nThe economic aspects of the period between 1865 and 1900 may be readily\\nsummed up: the recovery of the South from the ruin of the Civil War, the\\nextension of the railways, the development of the Great West, and the\\ntriumph of industry and business enterprise. In the South many of the\\ngreat plantations were broken up and sold in small farms, crops were\\ndiversified, the small farming class was raised in the scale of social\\nimportance, the cotton industry was launched, and the coal, iron,\\ntimber, and other resources were brought into use. In the West the free\\narable land was practically exhausted by 1890 under the terms of the\\nHomestead Act; gold, silver, copper, coal and other minerals were\\ndiscovered in abundance; numerous rail connections were formed with the\\nAtlantic seaboard; the cowboy and the Indian were swept away before a\\nstandardized civilization of electric lights and bathtubs. By the end of\\nthe century the American frontier had disappeared. The wild, primitive\\nlife so long associated with America was gone. The unity of the nation\\nwas established.\\n\\nIn the field of business enterprise, progress was most marked. The\\nindustrial system, which had risen and flourished before the Civil War,\\ngrew into immense proportions and the industrial area was extended from\\nthe Northeast into all parts of the country. Small business concerns\\nwere transformed into huge corporations. Individual plants were merged\\nunder the management of gigantic trusts. Short railway lines were\\nconsolidated into national systems. The industrial population of\\nwage-earners rose into the tens of millions. The immigration of aliens\\nincreased by leaps and bounds. The cities overshadowed the country. The\\nnation that had once depended upon Europe for most of its manufactured\\ngoods became a competitor of Europe in the markets of the earth.\\n\\nIn the sphere of politics, the period witnessed the recovery of white\\nsupremacy in the South; the continued discussion of the old questions,\\nsuch as the currency, the tariff, and national banking; and the\\ninjection of new issues like the trusts and labor problems. As of old,\\nforeign affairs were kept well at the front. Alaska was purchased from\\nRussia; attempts were made to extend American influence in the Caribbean\\nregion; a Samoan island was brought under the flag; and the Hawaiian\\nislands were annexed. The Monroe Doctrine was applied with vigor in the\\ndispute between Venezuela and Great Britain.\\n\\nAssistance was given to the Cubans in their revolutionary struggle\\nagainst Spain and thus there was precipitated a war which ended in the\\nannexation of Porto Rico and the Philippines. American influence in the\\nPacific and the Orient was so enlarged as to be a factor of great weight\\nin world affairs. Thus questions connected with foreign and \"imperial\"\\npolicies were united with domestic issues to make up the warp and woof\\nof politics. In the direction of affairs, the Republicans took the\\nleadership, for they held the presidency during all the years, except\\neight, between 1865 and 1900.\\n\\n\\n=References=\\n\\nJ.W.

PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRACY AND THE WORLD WAR\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI\\n\\nTHE EVOLUTION OF REPUBLICAN POLICIES (1901-13)\\n\\n\\n=The Personality and Early Career of Roosevelt.=--On September 14, 1901,\\nwhen Theodore Roosevelt took the oath of office, the presidency passed\\nto a new generation and a leader of a new type recalling, if comparisons\\nmust be made, Andrew Jackson rather than any Republican predecessor.\\nRoosevelt was brusque, hearty, restless, and fond of action--\"a young\\nfellow of infinite dash and originality,\" as John Hay remarked of him;\\ncombining the spirit of his old college, Harvard, with the breezy\\nfreedom of the plains; interested in everything--a new species of game,\\na new book, a diplomatic riddle, or a novel theory of history or\\nbiology. Though only forty-three years old he was well versed in the art\\nof practical politics. Coming upon the political scene in the early\\neighties, he had associated himself with the reformers in the Republican\\nparty; but he was no Mugwump. From the first he vehemently preached the\\ndoctrine of party loyalty; if beaten in the convention, he voted the\\nstraight ticket in the election. For twenty years he adhered to this\\nrule and during a considerable portion of that period he held office as\\na spokesman of his party. He served in the New York legislature, as head\\nof the metropolitan police force, as federal civil service commissioner\\nunder President Harrison, as assistant secretary of the navy under\\nPresident McKinley, and as governor of the Empire state. Political\\nmanagers of the old school spoke of him as \"brilliant but erratic\"; they\\nsoon found him equal to the shrewdest in negotiation and action.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nROOSEVELT TALKING TO THE ENGINEER OF A RAILROAD TRAIN]\\n\\n\\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS\\n\\n=The Panama Canal.=--The most important foreign question confronting\\nPresident Roosevelt on the day of his inauguration, that of the Panama\\nCanal, was a heritage from his predecessor. The idea of a water route\\nacross the isthmus, long a dream of navigators, had become a living\\nissue after the historic voyage of the battleship _Oregon_ around South\\nAmerica during the Spanish War. But before the United States could act\\nit had to undo the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, made with Great Britain in\\n1850, providing for the construction of the canal under joint\\nsupervision. This was finally effected by the Hay-Pauncefote treaty of\\n1901 authorizing the United States to proceed alone, on condition that\\nthere should be no discriminations against other nations in the matter\\nof rates and charges.\\n\\nThis accomplished, it was necessary to decide just where the canal\\nshould be built. One group in Congress favored the route through\\nNicaragua; in fact, two official commissions had already approved that\\nlocation. Another group favored cutting the way through Panama after\\npurchasing the rights of the old French company which, under the\\ndirection of De Lesseps, the hero of the Suez Canal, had made a costly\\nfailure some twenty years before. After a heated argument over the\\nmerits of the two plans, preference was given to the Panama route. As\\nthe isthmus was then a part of Colombia, President Roosevelt proceeded\\nto negotiate with the government at Bogota a treaty authorizing the\\nUnited States to cut a canal through its territory. The treaty was\\neasily framed, but it was rejected by the Colombian senate, much to the\\nPresident\\'s exasperation. \"You could no more make an agreement with the\\nColombian rulers,\" he exclaimed, \"than you could nail jelly to a wall.\"\\nHe was spared the necessity by a timely revolution. On November 3, 1903,\\nPanama renounced its allegiance to Colombia and three days later the\\nUnited States recognized its independence.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Courtesy of Panama Canal, Washington, D.C._\\n\\nDEEPEST EXCAVATED PORTION OF PANAMA CANAL, SHOWING GOLD HILL ON\\nRIGHT AND CONTRACTOR\\'S HILL ON LEFT. JUNE, 1913]\\n\\nThis amazing incident was followed shortly by the signature of a treaty\\nbetween Panama and the United States in which the latter secured the\\nright to construct the long-discussed canal, in return for a guarantee\\nof independence and certain cash payments. The rights and property of\\nthe French concern were then bought, and the final details settled. A\\nlock rather than a sea-level canal was agreed upon. Construction by the\\ngovernment directly instead of by private contractors was adopted.\\nScientific medicine was summoned to stamp out the tropical diseases\\nthat had made Panama a plague spot. Finally, in 1904, as the President\\nsaid, \"the dirt began to fly.\" After surmounting formidable\\ndifficulties--engineering, labor, and sanitary--the American forces in\\n1913 joined the waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific. Nearly eight\\nthousand miles were cut off the sea voyage from New York to San\\nFrancisco. If any were inclined to criticize President Roosevelt for\\nthe way in which he snapped off negotiations with Colombia and\\nrecognized the Panama revolutionists, their attention was drawn to the\\nmagnificent outcome of the affair. Notwithstanding the treaty with Great\\nBritain, Congress passed a tolls bill discriminating in rates in favor\\nof American ships. It was only on the urgent insistence of President\\nWilson that the measure was later repealed.\\n\\n=The Conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War.=--The applause which greeted\\nthe President\\'s next diplomatic stroke was unmarred by censure of any\\nkind. In the winter of 1904 there broke out between Japan and Russia a\\nterrible conflict over the division of spoils in Manchuria. The fortunes\\nof war were with the agile forces of Nippon. In this struggle, it seems,\\nPresident Roosevelt\\'s sympathies were mainly with the Japanese, although\\nhe observed the proprieties of neutrality. At all events, Secretary Hay\\nwrote in his diary on New Year\\'s Day, 1905, that the President was\\n\"quite firm in his view that we cannot permit Japan to be robbed a\\nsecond time of her victory,\" referring to the fact that Japan, ten years\\nbefore, after defeating China on the field of battle, had been forced by\\nRussia, Germany, and France to forego the fruits of conquest.\\n\\nWhatever the President\\'s personal feelings may have been, he was aware\\nthat Japan, despite her triumphs over Russia, was staggering under a\\nheavy burden of debt. At a suggestion from Tokyo, he invited both\\nbelligerents in the summer of 1905 to join in a peace conference. The\\ncelerity of their reply was aided by the pressure of European bankers,\\nwho had already come to a substantial agreement that the war must stop.\\nAfter some delay, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, was chosen as the meeting\\nplace for the spokesmen of the two warring powers. Roosevelt presided\\nover the opening ceremonies with fine urbanity, thoroughly enjoying the\\njustly earned honor of being for the moment at the center of the world\\'s\\ninterest. He had the satisfaction of seeing the conference end in a\\ntreaty of peace and amity.\\n\\n=The Monroe Doctrine Applied to Germany.=--Less spectacular than the\\nRusso-Japanese settlement but not less important was a diplomatic\\npassage-at-arms with Germany over the Monroe Doctrine. This clash grew\\nout of the inability or unwillingness of the Venezuelan government to\\npay debts due foreign creditors. Having exhausted their patience in\\nnegotiations, England and Germany, in December 1901, sent battleships to\\nestablish what they characterized as \"a peaceful blockade\" of Venezuelan\\nports. Their action was followed by the rupture of diplomatic relations;\\nthere was a possibility that war and the occupation of Venezuelan\\nterritory might result.\\n\\nWhile unwilling to stand between a Latin-American country and its\\ncreditors, President Roosevelt was determined that debt collecting\\nshould not be made an excuse for European countries to seize territory.\\nHe therefore urged arbitration of the dispute, winning the assent of\\nEngland and Italy. Germany, with a somewhat haughty air, refused to take\\nthe milder course. The President, learning of this refusal, called the\\nGerman ambassador to the White House and informed him in very precise\\nterms that, unless the Imperial German Government consented to\\narbitrate, Admiral Dewey would be ordered to the scene with instructions\\nto prevent Germany from seizing any Venezuelan territory. A week passed\\nand no answer came from Berlin. Not baffled, the President again took\\nthe matter up with the ambassador, this time with even more firmness; he\\nstated in language admitting of but one meaning that, unless within\\nforty-eight hours the Emperor consented to arbitration, American\\nbattleships, already coaled and cleared, would sail for Venezuelan\\nwaters. The hint was sufficient. The Kaiser accepted the proposal and\\nthe President, with the fine irony of diplomacy, complimented him\\npublicly on \"being so stanch an advocate of arbitration.\" In terms of\\nthe Monroe Doctrine this action meant that the United States, while not\\ndenying the obligations of debtors, would not permit any move on the\\npart of European powers that might easily lead to the temporary or\\npermanent occupation of Latin-American territory.\\n\\n=The Santo Domingo Affair.=--The same issue was involved in a\\ncontroversy over Santo Domingo which arose in 1904. The Dominican\\nrepublic, like Venezuela, was heavily in debt, and certain European\\ncountries declared that, unless the United States undertook to look\\nafter the finances of the embarrassed debtor, they would resort to armed\\ncoercion. What was the United States to do? The danger of having some\\nEuropean power strongly intrenched in Santo Domingo was too imminent to\\nbe denied. President Roosevelt acted with characteristic speed, and\\nnotwithstanding strong opposition in the Senate was able, in 1907, to\\neffect a treaty arrangement which placed Dominican finances under\\nAmerican supervision.\\n\\nIn the course of the debate over this settlement, a number of\\ninteresting questions arose. It was pertinently asked whether the\\nAmerican navy should be used to help creditors collect their debts\\nanywhere in Latin-America. It was suggested also that no sanction should\\nbe given to the practice among European governments of using armed force\\nto collect private claims. Opponents of President Roosevelt\\'s policy,\\nand they were neither few nor insignificant, urged that such matters\\nshould be referred to the Hague Court or to special international\\ncommissions for arbitration. To this the answer was made that the United\\nStates could not surrender any question coming under the terms of the\\nMonroe Doctrine to the decision of an international tribunal. The\\nposition of the administration was very clearly stated by President\\nRoosevelt himself. \"The country,\" he said, \"would certainly decline to\\ngo to war to prevent a foreign government from collecting a just debt;\\non the other hand, it is very inadvisable to permit any foreign power to\\ntake possession, even temporarily, of the customs houses of an American\\nrepublic in order to enforce the payment of its obligations; for such a\\ntemporary occupation might turn into a permanent occupation. The only\\nescape from these alternatives may at any time be that we must\\nourselves undertake to bring about some arrangement by which so much as\\npossible of a just obligation shall be paid.\" The Monroe Doctrine was\\nnegative. It denied to European powers a certain liberty of operation in\\nthis hemisphere. The positive obligations resulting from its application\\nby the United States were points now emphasized and developed.\\n\\n=The Hague Conference.=--The controversies over Latin-American relations\\nand his part in bringing the Russo-Japanese War to a close naturally\\nmade a deep impression upon Roosevelt, turning his mind in the direction\\nof the peaceful settlement of international disputes. The subject was\\nmoreover in the air. As if conscious of impending calamity, the\\nstatesmen of the Old World, to all outward signs at least, seemed\\nsearching for a way to reduce armaments and avoid the bloody and costly\\ntrial of international causes by the ancient process of battle. It was\\nthe Czar, Nicholas II, fated to die in one of the terrible holocausts\\nwhich he helped to bring upon mankind, who summoned the delegates of the\\nnations in the first Hague Peace Conference in 1899. The conference did\\nnothing to reduce military burdens or avoid wars but it did recognize\\nthe right of friendly nations to offer the services of mediation to\\ncountries at war and did establish a Court at the Hague for the\\narbitration of international disputes.\\n\\nEncouraged by this experiment, feeble as it was, President Roosevelt in\\n1904 proposed a second conference, yielding to the Czar the honor of\\nissuing the call. At this great international assembly, held at the\\nHague in 1907, the representatives of the United States proposed a plan\\nfor the compulsory arbitration of certain matters of international\\ndispute. This was rejected with contempt by Germany. Reduction of\\narmaments, likewise proposed in the conference, was again deferred. In\\nfact, nothing was accomplished beyond agreement upon certain rules for\\nthe conduct of \"civilized warfare,\" casting a somewhat lurid light upon\\nthe \"pacific\" intentions of most of the powers assembled.\\n\\n=The World Tour of the Fleet.=--As if to assure the world then that the\\nUnited States placed little reliance upon the frail reed of peace\\nconferences, Roosevelt the following year (1908) made an imposing\\ndisplay of American naval power by sending a fleet of sixteen\\nbattleships on a tour around the globe. On his own authority, he ordered\\nthe ships to sail out of Hampton Roads and circle the earth by way of\\nthe Straits of Magellan, San Francisco, Australia, the Philippines,\\nChina, Japan, and the Suez Canal. This enterprise was not, as some\\ncritics claimed, a \"mere boyish flourish.\" President Roosevelt knew how\\ndeep was the influence of sea power on the fate of nations. He was aware\\nthat no country could have a wide empire of trade and dominion without\\nforce adequate to sustain it. The voyage around the world therefore\\nserved a double purpose. It interested his own country in the naval\\nprogram of the government, and it reminded other powers that the\\nAmerican giant, though quiet, was not sleeping in the midst of\\ninternational rivalries.\\n\\n\\nCOLONIAL ADMINISTRATION\\n\\n=A Constitutional Question Settled.=--In colonial administration, as in\\nforeign policy, President Roosevelt advanced with firm step in a path\\nalready marked out. President McKinley had defined the principles that\\nwere to control the development of Porto Rico and the Philippines. The\\nRepublican party had announced a program of pacification, gradual\\nself-government, and commercial improvement. The only remaining question\\nof importance, to use the popular phrase,--\"Does the Constitution follow\\nthe flag?\"--had been answered by the Supreme Court of the United States.\\nAlthough it was well known that the Constitution did not contemplate the\\ngovernment of dependencies, such as the Philippines and Porto Rico, the\\nCourt, by generous and ingenious interpretations, found a way for\\nCongress to apply any reasonable rules required by the occasion.\\n\\n=Porto Rico.=--The government of Porto Rico was a relatively simple\\nmatter. It was a single island with a fairly homogeneous population\\napart from the Spanish upper class. For a time after military occupation\\nin 1898, it was administered under military rule. This was succeeded by\\nthe establishment of civil government under the \"organic act\" passed by\\nCongress in 1900. The law assured to the Porto Ricans American\\nprotection but withheld American citizenship--a boon finally granted in\\n1917. It provided for a governor and six executive secretaries appointed\\nby the President with the approval of the Senate; and for a legislature\\nof two houses--one elected by popular native vote, and an upper chamber\\ncomposed of the executive secretaries and five other persons appointed\\nin the same manner. Thus the United States turned back to the provincial\\nsystem maintained by England in Virginia or New York in old colonial\\ndays. The natives were given a voice in their government and the power\\nof initiating laws; but the final word both in law-making and\\nadministration was vested in officers appointed in Washington. Such was\\nthe plan under which the affairs of Porto Rico were conducted by\\nPresident Roosevelt. It lasted until the new organic act of 1917.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Photograph from Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nA SUGAR MILL, PORTO RICO]\\n\\n=The Philippines.=--The administration of the Philippines presented far\\nmore difficult questions. The number of islands, the variety of\\nlanguages and races, the differences in civilization all combined to\\nchallenge the skill of the government. Moreover, there was raging in\\n1901 a stubborn revolt against American authority, which had to be\\nfaced. Following the lines laid down by President McKinley, the\\nevolution of American policy fell into three stages. At first the\\nislands were governed directly by the President under his supreme\\nmilitary power. In 1901 a civilian commission, headed by William Howard\\nTaft, was selected by the President and charged with the government of\\nthe provinces in which order had been restored. Six years later, under\\nthe terms of an organic act, passed by Congress in 1902, the third stage\\nwas reached. The local government passed into the hands of a governor\\nand commission, appointed by the President and Senate, and a\\nlegislature--one house elected by popular vote and an upper chamber\\n\\ncomposed of the commission. This scheme, like that obtaining in Porto\\nRico, remained intact until a Democratic Congress under President\\nWilson\\'s leadership carried the colonial administration into its fourth\\nphase by making both houses elective. Thus, by the steady pursuit of a\\nliberal policy, self-government was extended to the dependencies; but it\\nencouraged rather than extinguished the vigorous movement among the\\nPhilippine natives for independence.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nMR TAFT IN THE PHILIPPINES]\\n\\n=Cuban Relations.=--Within the sphere of colonial affairs, Cuba, though\\nnominally independent, also presented problems to the government at\\nWashington. In the fine enthusiasm that accompanied the declaration of\\nwar on Spain, Congress, unmindful of practical considerations,\\nrecognized the independence of Cuba and disclaimed \"any disposition or\\nintention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said\\nisland except for the pacification thereof.\" In the settlement that\\nfollowed the war, however, it was deemed undesirable to set the young\\nrepublic adrift upon the stormy sea of international politics without a\\nguiding hand. Before withdrawing American troops from the island,\\nCongress, in March, 1901, enacted, and required Cuba to approve, a\\nseries of restrictions known as the Platt amendment, limiting her power\\nto incur indebtedness, securing the right of the United States to\\nintervene whenever necessary to protect life and property, and reserving\\nto the United States coaling stations at certain points to be agreed\\nupon. The Cubans made strong protests against what they deemed\\n\"infringements of their sovereignty\"; but finally with good grace\\naccepted their fate. Even when in 1906 President Roosevelt landed\\nAmerican troops in the island to quell a domestic dissension, they\\nacquiesced in the action, evidently regarding it as a distinct warning\\nthat they should learn to manage their elections in an orderly manner.\\n\\n\\nTHE ROOSEVELT DOMESTIC POLICIES\\n\\n=Social Questions to the Front.=--From the day of his inauguration to\\nthe close of his service in 1909, President Roosevelt, in messages,\\nspeeches, and interviews, kept up a lively and interesting discussion of\\ntrusts, capital, labor, poverty, riches, lawbreaking, good citizenship,\\nand kindred themes. Many a subject previously touched upon only by\\nrepresentatives of the minor and dissenting parties, he dignified by a\\ncareful examination. That he did this with any fixed design or policy in\\nmind does not seem to be the case. He admitted himself that when he\\nbecame President he did not have in hand any settled or far-reaching\\nplan of social betterment. He did have, however, serious convictions on\\ngeneral principles. \"I was bent upon making the government,\" he wrote,\\n\"the most efficient possible instrument in helping the people of the\\nUnited States to better themselves in every way, politically, socially,\\nand industrially. I believed with all my heart in real and\\nthorough-going democracy and I wished to make the democracy industrial\\nas well as political, although I had only partially formulated the\\nmethod I believed we should follow.\" It is thus evident at least that he\\nhad departed a long way from the old idea of the government as nothing\\nbut a great policeman keeping order among the people in a struggle over\\nthe distribution of the nation\\'s wealth and resources.\\n\\n=Roosevelt\\'s View of the Constitution.=--Equally significant was\\nRoosevelt\\'s attitude toward the Constitution and the office of\\nPresident. He utterly repudiated the narrow construction of our national\\ncharter. He held that the Constitution \"should be treated as the\\ngreatest document ever devised by the wit of man to aid a people in\\nexercising every power necessary for its own betterment, not as a\\nstrait-jacket cunningly fashioned to strangle growth.\" He viewed the\\npresidency as he did the Constitution. Strict constructionists of the\\nJeffersonian school, of whom there were many on occasion even in the\\nRepublican party, had taken a view that the President could do nothing\\nthat he was not specifically authorized by the Constitution to do.\\nRoosevelt took exactly the opposite position. It was his opinion that it\\nwas not only the President\\'s right but his duty \"to do anything that the\\nneeds of the nation demanded unless such action was forbidden by the\\nConstitution or the laws.\" He went on to say that he acted \"for the\\ncommon well-being of all our people whenever and in whatever manner was\\nnecessary, unless prevented by direct constitutional or legislative\\nprohibition.\"\\n\\n=The Trusts and Railways.=--To the trust question, Roosevelt devoted\\nespecial attention. This was unavoidable. By far the larger part of the\\nbusiness of the country was done by corporations as distinguished from\\npartnerships and individual owners. The growth of these gigantic\\naggregations of capital had been the leading feature in American\\nindustrial development during the last two decades of the nineteenth\\ncentury. In the conquest of business by trusts and \"the resulting\\nprivate fortunes of great magnitude,\" the Populists and the Democrats\\nhad seen a grievous danger to the republic. \"Plutocracy has taken the\\nplace of democracy; the tariff breeds trusts; let us destroy therefore\\nthe tariff and the trusts\"--such was the battle cry which had been taken\\nup by Bryan and his followers.\\n\\nPresident Roosevelt countered vigorously. He rejected the idea that the\\ntrusts were the product of the tariff or of governmental action of any\\nkind. He insisted that they were the outcome of \"natural economic\\nforces\": (1) destructive competition among business men compelling them\\nto avoid ruin by cooperation in fixing prices; (2) the growth of markets\\non a national scale and even international scale calling for vast\\naccumulations of capital to carry on such business; (3) the possibility\\nof immense savings by the union of many plants under one management. In\\nthe corporation he saw a new stage in the development of American\\nindustry. Unregulated competition he regarded as \"the source of evils\\nwhich all men concede must be remedied if this civilization of ours is\\nto survive.\" The notion, therefore, that these immense business concerns\\nshould be or could be broken up by a decree of law, Roosevelt considered\\nabsurd.\\n\\nAt the same time he proposed that \"evil trusts\" should be prevented from\\n\"wrong-doing of any kind\"; that is, punished for plain swindling, for\\nmaking agreements to limit output, for refusing to sell to customers who\\ndealt with rival firms, and for conspiracies with railways to ruin\\ncompetitors by charging high freight rates and for similar abuses.\\nAccordingly, he proposed, not the destruction of the trusts, but their\\nregulation by the government. This, he contended, would preserve the\\nadvantages of business on a national scale while preventing the evils\\nthat accompanied it. The railway company he declared to be a public\\nservant. \"Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike.\"\\nSo he answered those who thought that trusts and railway combinations\\nwere private concerns to be managed solely by their owners without let\\nor hindrance and also those who thought trusts and railway combinations\\ncould be abolished by tariff reduction or criminal prosecution.\\n\\n=The Labor Question.=--On the labor question, then pressing to the front\\nin public interest, President Roosevelt took advanced ground for his\\ntime. He declared that the working-man, single-handed and empty-handed,\\nthreatened with starvation if unemployed, was no match for the employer\\nwho was able to bargain and wait. This led him, accordingly, to accept\\nthe principle of the trade union; namely, that only by collective\\nbargaining can labor be put on a footing to measure its strength equally\\nwith capital. While he severely arraigned labor leaders who advocated\\nviolence and destructive doctrines, he held that \"the organization of\\nlabor into trade unions and federations is necessary, is beneficent, and\\nis one of the greatest possible agencies in the attainment of a true\\nindustrial, as well as a true political, democracy in the United\\nStates.\" The last resort of trade unions in labor disputes, the strike,\\nhe approved in case negotiations failed to secure \"a fair deal.\"\\n\\nHe thought, however, that labor organizations, even if wisely managed,\\ncould not solve all the pressing social questions of the time. The aid\\nof the government at many points he believed to be necessary to\\neliminate undeserved poverty, industrial diseases, unemployment, and the\\nunfortunate consequences of industrial accidents. In his first message\\nof 1901, for instance, he urged that workers injured in industry should\\nhave certain and ample compensation. From time to time he advocated\\nother legislation to obtain what he called \"a larger measure of social\\nand industrial justice.\"\\n\\n=Great Riches and Taxation.=--Even the challenge of the radicals, such\\nas the Populists, who alleged that \"the toil of millions is boldly\\nstolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few\"--challenges which his\\npredecessors did not consider worthy of notice--President Roosevelt\\nrefused to let pass without an answer. In his first message he denied\\nthe truth of the common saying that the rich were growing richer and the\\npoor were growing poorer. He asserted that, on the contrary, the average\\nman, wage worker, farmer, and small business man, was better off than\\never before in the history of our country. That there had been abuses in\\nthe accumulation of wealth he did not pretend to ignore, but he believed\\nthat even immense fortunes, on the whole, represented positive benefits\\nconferred upon the country. Nevertheless he felt that grave dangers to\\nthe safety and the happiness of the people lurked in great inequalities\\nof wealth. In 1906 he wrote that he wished it were in his power to\\nprevent the heaping up of enormous fortunes. The next year, to the\\nastonishment of many leaders in his own party, he boldly announced in a\\nmessage to Congress that he approved both income and inheritance taxes,\\nthen generally viewed as Populist or Democratic measures. He even took\\nthe stand that such taxes should be laid in order to bring about a more\\nequitable distribution of wealth and greater equality of opportunity\\namong citizens.\\n\\n\\nLEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE ACTIVITIES\\n\\n=Economic Legislation.=--When President Roosevelt turned from the field\\nof opinion he found himself in a different sphere. Many of his views\\nwere too advanced for the members of his party in Congress, and where\\nresults depended upon the making of new laws, his progress was slow.\\nNevertheless, in his administrations several measures were enacted that\\nbore the stamp of his theories, though it could hardly be said that he\\ndominated Congress to the same degree as did some other Presidents. The\\nHepburn Railway Act of 1906 enlarged the interstate commerce commission;\\nit extended the commission\\'s power over oil pipe lines, express\\ncompanies, and other interstate carriers; it gave the commission the\\nright to reduce rates found to be unreasonable and discriminatory; it\\nforbade \"midnight tariffs,\" that is, sudden changes in rates favoring\\ncertain shippers; and it prohibited common carriers from transporting\\ngoods owned by themselves, especially coal, except for their own proper\\nuse. Two important pure food and drug laws, enacted during the same\\nyear, were designed to protect the public against diseased meats and\\ndeleterious foods and drugs. A significant piece of labor legislation\\nwas an act of the same Congress making interstate railways liable to\\ndamages for injuries sustained by their employees. When this measure was\\ndeclared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court it was reenacted with the\\nobjectionable clauses removed. A second installment of labor legislation\\nwas offered in the law of 1908 limiting the hours of railway employees\\nengaged as trainmen or telegraph operators.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Courtesy United States Reclamation Service._\\n\\nTHE ROOSEVELT DAM, PHOENIX, ARIZONA]\\n\\n=Reclamation and Conservation.=--The open country--the deserts, the\\nforests, waterways, and the public lands--interested President Roosevelt\\nno less than railway and industrial questions. Indeed, in his first\\nmessage to Congress he placed the conservation of natural resources\\namong \"the most vital internal problems\" of the age, and forcibly\\nemphasized an issue that had been discussed in a casual way since\\nCleveland\\'s first administration. The suggestion evoked an immediate\\nresponse in Congress. Under the leadership of Senator Newlands, of\\nNevada, the Reclamation Act of 1902 was passed, providing for the\\nredemption of the desert areas of the West. The proceeds from the sale\\nof public lands were dedicated to the construction of storage dams and\\nsluiceways to hold water and divert it as needed to the thirsty sands.\\nFurthermore it was stipulated that the rents paid by water users should\\ngo into a reclamation fund to continue the good work forever.\\nConstruction was started immediately under the terms of the law. Within\\nseventeen years about 1,600,000 acres had been reclaimed and more than a\\nmillion were actually irrigated. In the single year 1918, the crops of\\nthe irrigated districts were valued at approximately $100,000,000.\\n\\nIn his first message, also, President Roosevelt urged the transfer of\\nall control over national forests to trained men in the Bureau of\\nForestry--a recommendation carried out in 1907 when the Forestry Service\\nwas created. In every direction noteworthy advances were made in the\\nadministration of the national domain. The science of forestry was\\nimproved and knowledge of the subject spread among the people. Lands in\\nthe national forest available for agriculture were opened to settlers.\\nWater power sites on the public domain were leased for a term of years\\nto private companies instead of being sold outright. The area of the\\nnational forests was enlarged from 43 million acres to 194 million acres\\nby presidential proclamation--more than 43 million acres being added in\\none year, 1907. The men who turned sheep and cattle to graze on the\\npublic lands were compelled to pay a fair rental, much to their\\ndissatisfaction. Fire prevention work was undertaken in the forests on a\\nlarge scale, reducing the appalling, annual destruction of timber.\\nMillions of acres of coal land, such as the government had been\\ncarelessly selling to mining companies at low figures, were withdrawn\\nfrom sale and held until Congress was prepared to enact laws for the\\ndisposition of them in the public interest. Prosecutions were\\ninstituted against men who had obtained public lands by fraud and vast\\ntracts were recovered for the national domain. An agitation was begun\\nwhich bore fruit under the administrations of Taft and Wilson in laws\\nreserving to the federal government the ownership of coal, water power,\\nphosphates, and other natural resources while authorizing corporations\\nto develop them under leases for a period of years.\\n\\n=The Prosecution of the Trusts.=--As an executive, President Roosevelt\\nwas also a distinct \"personality.\" His discrimination between \"good\" and\\n\"bad\" trusts led him to prosecute some of them with vigor. On his\\ninitiative, the Northern Securities Company, formed to obtain control of\\ncertain great western railways, was dissolved by order of the Supreme\\nCourt. Proceedings were instituted against the American Tobacco Company\\nand the Standard Oil Company as monopolies in violation of the Sherman\\nAnti-Trust law. The Sugar Trust was found guilty of cheating the New\\nYork customs house and some of the minor officers were sent to prison.\\nFrauds in the Post-office Department were uncovered and the offenders\\nbrought to book. In fact hardly a week passed without stirring news of\\n\"wrong doers\" and \"malefactors\" haled into federal courts.\\n\\n=The Great Coal Strike.=--The Roosevelt theory that the President could\\ndo anything for public welfare not forbidden by the Constitution and the\\nlaws was put to a severe test in 1902. A strike of the anthracite coal\\nminers, which started in the summer, ran late into the autumn.\\nIndustries were paralyzed for the want of coal; cities were threatened\\nwith the appalling menace of a winter without heat. Governors and mayors\\nwere powerless and appealed for aid. The mine owners rejected the\\ndemands of the men and refused to permit the arbitration of the points\\nin dispute, although John Mitchell, the leader of the miners, repeatedly\\nurged it. After observing closely the course affairs, President\\nRoosevelt made up his mind that the situation was intolerable. He\\narranged to have the federal troops, if necessary, take possession of\\nthe mines and operate them until the strike could be settled. He then\\ninvited the contestants to the White House and by dint of hard labor\\ninduced them to accept, as a substitute or compromise, arbitration by a\\ncommission which he appointed. Thus, by stepping outside the\\nConstitution and acting as the first citizen of the land, President\\nRoosevelt averted a crisis of great magnitude.\\n\\n=The Election of 1904.=--The views and measures which he advocated with\\nsuch vigor aroused deep hostility within as well as without his party.\\nThere were rumors of a Republican movement to defeat his nomination in\\n1904 and it was said that the \"financial and corporation interests\" were\\nin arms against him. A prominent Republican paper in New York City\\naccused him of having \"stolen Mr. Bryan\\'s thunder,\" by harrying the\\ntrusts and favoring labor unions. When the Republican convention\\nassembled in Chicago, however, the opposition disappeared and Roosevelt\\nwas nominated by acclamation.\\n\\nThis was the signal for a change on the part of Democratic leaders. They\\ndenounced the President as erratic, dangerous, and radical and decided\\nto assume the moderate role themselves. They put aside Mr. Bryan and\\nselected as their candidate, Judge Alton B. Parker, of New York, a man\\n\\nwho repudiated free silver and made a direct appeal for the conservative\\nvote. The outcome of the reversal was astounding. Judge Parker\\'s vote\\nfell more than a million below that cast for Bryan in 1900; of the 476\\nelectoral votes he received only 140. Roosevelt, in addition to sweeping\\nthe Republican sections, even invaded Democratic territory, carrying the\\nstate of Missouri. Thus vindicated at the polls, he became more\\noutspoken than ever. His leadership in the party was so widely\\nrecognized that he virtually selected his own successor.\\n\\n\\nTHE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT TAFT\\n\\n=The Campaign of 1908.=--Long before the end of his elective term,\\nPresident Roosevelt let it be known that he favored as his successor,\\nWilliam Howard Taft, of Ohio, his Secretary of War. To attain this end\\nhe used every shred of his powerful influence. When the Republican\\nconvention assembled, Mr. Taft easily won the nomination. Though the\\nparty platform was conservative in tone, he gave it a progressive tinge\\nby expressing his personal belief in the popular election of United\\nStates Senators, an income tax, and other liberal measures. President\\nRoosevelt announced his faith in the Republican candidate and appealed\\nto the country for his election.\\n\\nThe turn in Republican affairs now convinced Mr. Bryan that the signs\\nwere propitious for a third attempt to win the presidency. The disaster\\nto Judge Parker had taught the party that victory did not lie in a\\nconservative policy. With little difficulty, therefore, the veteran\\nleader from Nebraska once more rallied the Democrats around his\\nstandard, won the nomination, and wrote a platform vigorously attacking\\nthe tariff, trusts, and monopolies. Supported by a loyal following, he\\nentered the lists, only to meet another defeat. Though he polled almost\\na million and a half more votes than did Judge Parker in 1904, the palm\\nwent to Mr. Taft.\\n\\n=The Tariff Revision and Party Dissensions.=--At the very beginning of\\nhis term, President Taft had to face the tariff issue. He had met it in\\nthe campaign. Moved by the Democratic demand for a drastic reduction, he\\nhad expressed opinions which were thought to imply a \"downward\\nrevision.\" The Democrats made much of the implication and the\\nRepublicans from the Middle West rejoiced in it. Pressure was coming\\nfrom all sides. More than ten years had elapsed since the enactment of\\nthe Dingley bill and the position of many industries had been altered\\nwith the course of time. Evidently the day for revision--at best a\\nthankless task--had arrived. Taft accepted the inevitable and called\\nCongress in a special session. Until the midsummer of 1909, Republican\\nSenators and Representatives wrangled over tariff schedules, the\\nPresident making little effort to influence their decisions. When on\\nAugust 5 the Payne-Aldrich bill became a law, a breach had been made in\\nRepublican ranks. Powerful Senators from the Middle West had spoken\\nangrily against many of the high rates imposed by the bill. They had\\neven broken with their party colleagues to vote against the entire\\nscheme of tariff revision.\\n\\n=The Income Tax Amendment.=--The rift in party harmony was widened by\\nanother serious difference of opinion. During the debate on the tariff\\nbill, there was a concerted movement to include in it an income tax\\nprovision--this in spite of the decision of the Supreme Court in 1895\\ndeclaring it unconstitutional. Conservative men were alarmed by the\\nevident willingness of some members to flout a solemn decree of that\\neminent tribunal. At the same time they saw a powerful combination of\\nRepublicans and Democrats determined upon shifting some of the burden of\\ntaxation to large incomes. In the press of circumstances, a compromise\\nwas reached. The income tax bill was dropped for the present; but\\nCongress passed the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution, authorizing\\ntaxes upon incomes from whatever source they might be derived, without\\nreference to any apportionment among the states on the basis of\\npopulation. The states ratified the amendment and early in 1913 it was\\nproclaimed.\\n\\n=President Taft\\'s Policies.=--After the enactment of the tariff bill,\\nTaft continued to push forward with his legislative program. He\\nrecommended, and Congress created, a special court of commerce with\\njurisdiction, among other things, over appeals from the interstate\\ncommerce commission, thus facilitating judicial review of the railway\\nrates fixed and the orders issued by that body. This measure was quickly\\nfollowed by an act establishing a system of postal savings banks in\\nconnection with the post office--a scheme which had long been opposed by\\nprivate banks. Two years later, Congress defied the lobby of the express\\ncompanies and supplemented the savings banks with a parcels post system,\\nthus enabling the American postal service to catch up with that of other\\nprogressive nations. With a view to improving the business\\nadministration of the federal government, the President obtained from\\nCongress a large appropriation for an economy and efficiency commission\\ncharged with the duty of inquiring into wasteful and obsolete methods\\nand recommending improved devices and practices. The chief result of\\nthis investigation was a vigorous report in favor of a national budget\\nsystem, which soon found public backing.\\n\\nPresident Taft negotiated with England and France general treaties\\nproviding for the arbitration of disputes which were \"justiciable\" in\\ncharacter even though they might involve questions of \"vital interest\\nand national honor.\" They were coldly received in the Senate and so\\namended that Taft abandoned them altogether. A tariff reciprocity\\nagreement with Canada, however, he forced through Congress in the face\\nof strong opposition from his own party. After making a serious breach\\nin Republican ranks, he was chagrined to see the whole scheme come to\\nnaught by the overthrow of the Liberals in the Canadian elections of\\n1911.\\n\\n=Prosecution of the Trusts.=--The party schism was even enlarged by what\\nappeared to be the successful prosecution of several great combinations.\\nIn two important cases, the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of the\\nStandard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company on the ground that\\nthey violated the Sherman Anti-Trust law. In taking this step Chief\\nJustice White was at some pains to state that the law did not apply to\\ncombinations which did not \"unduly\" restrain trade. His remark,\\nconstrued to mean that the Court would not interfere with corporations\\nas such, became the subject of a popular outcry against the President\\nand the judges.\\n\\n\\nPROGRESSIVE INSURGENCY AND THE ELECTION OF 1912\\n\\n=Growing Dissensions.=--All in all, Taft\\'s administration from the first\\nday had been disturbed by party discord. High words had passed over the\\ntariff bill and disgruntled members of Congress could not forget them.\\nTo differences over issues were added quarrels between youth and old\\nage. In the House of Representatives there developed a group of young\\n\"insurgent\" Republicans who resented the dominance of the Speaker,\\nJoseph G. Cannon, and other members of the \"old guard,\" as they named\\nthe men of long service and conservative minds. In 1910, the insurgents\\nwent so far as to join with the Democrats in a movement to break the\\nSpeaker\\'s sway by ousting him from the rules committee and depriving him\\nof the power to appoint its members. The storm was brewing. In the\\nautumn of that year the Democrats won a clear majority in the House of\\nRepresentatives and began an open battle with President Taft by\\ndemanding an immediate downward revision of the tariff.\\n\\n=The Rise of the Progressive Republicans.=--Preparatory to the campaign\\nof 1912, the dissenters within the Republican party added the prefix\\n\"Progressive\" to their old title and began to organize a movement to\\nprevent the renomination of Mr. Taft. As early as January 21, 1911, they\\nformed a Progressive Republican League at the home of Senator La\\nFollette of Wisconsin and launched an attack on the Taft measures and\\npolicies. In October they indorsed Mr. La Follette as \"the logical\\nRepublican candidate\" and appealed to the party for support. The\\ncontroversy over the tariff had grown into a formidable revolt against\\nthe occupant of the White House.\\n\\n=Roosevelt in the Field.=--After looking on for a while, ex-President\\nRoosevelt took a hand in the fray. Soon after his return in 1910 from a\\nhunting trip in Africa and a tour in Europe, he made a series of\\naddresses in which he formulated a progressive program. In a speech in\\nKansas, he favored regulation of the trusts, a graduated income tax\\nbearing heavily on great fortunes, tariff revision schedule by schedule,\\nconservation of natural resources, labor legislation, the direct\\nprimary, and the recall of elective officials. In an address before the\\nOhio state constitutional convention in February, 1912, he indorsed the\\ninitiative and referendum and announced a doctrine known as the \"recall\\nof judicial decisions.\" This was a new and radical note in American\\npolitics. An ex-President of the United States proposed that the people\\nat the polls should have the right to reverse the decision of a judge\\nwho set aside any act of a state legislature passed in the interests of\\nsocial welfare. The Progressive Republicans, impressed by these\\naddresses, turned from La Follette to Roosevelt and on February 24,\\ninduced him to come out openly as a candidate against Taft for the\\nRepublican nomination.\\n\\n=The Split in the Republican Party.=--The country then witnessed the\\nstrange spectacle of two men who had once been close companions engaged\\nin a bitter rivalry to secure a majority of the delegates to the\\nRepublican convention to be held at Chicago. When the convention\\nassembled, about one-fourth of the seats were contested, the delegates\\nfor both candidates loudly proclaiming the regularity of their election.\\nIn deciding between the contestants the national committee, after the\\nusual hearings, settled the disputes in such a way that Taft received a\\nsafe majority. After a week of negotiation, Roosevelt and his followers\\nleft the Republican party. Most of his supporters withdrew from the\\nconvention and the few who remained behind refused to answer the roll\\ncall. Undisturbed by this formidable bolt, the regular Republicans went\\non with their work. They renominated Mr. Taft and put forth a platform\\nroundly condemning such Progressive doctrines as the recall of judges.\\n\\n=The Formation of the Progressive Party.=--The action of the Republicans\\nin seating the Taft delegates was vigorously denounced by Roosevelt. He\\ndeclared that the convention had no claim to represent the voters of the\\nRepublican party; that any candidate named by it would be \"the\\nbeneficiary of a successful fraud\"; and that it would be deeply\\ndiscreditable to any man to accept the convention\\'s approval under such\\ncircumstances. The bitterness of his followers was extreme. On July 8, a\\ncall went forth for a \"Progressive\" convention to be held in Chicago on\\nAugust 5. The assembly which duly met on that day was a unique political\\nconference. Prominence was given to women delegates, and \"politicians\"\\nwere notably absent. Roosevelt himself, who was cheered as a conquering\\nhero, made an impassioned speech setting forth his \"confession of\\nfaith.\" He was nominated by acclamation; Governor Hiram Johnson of\\nCalifornia was selected as his companion candidate for Vice President.\\nThe platform endorsed such political reforms as woman suffrage, direct\\nprimaries, the initiative, referendum, and recall, popular election of\\nUnited States Senators, and the short ballot. It favored a program of\\nsocial legislation, including the prohibition of child labor and minimum\\nwages for women. It approved the regulation, rather than the\\ndissolution, of the trusts. Like apostles in a new and lofty cause, the\\nProgressives entered a vigorous campaign for the election of their\\ndistinguished leader.\\n\\n=Woodrow Wilson and the Election of 1912.=--With the Republicans\\ndivided, victory loomed up before the Democrats. Naturally, a terrific\\ncontest over the nomination occurred at their convention in Baltimore.\\nChamp Clark, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Governor\\nWoodrow Wilson, of New Jersey, were the chief contestants. After tossing\\nto and fro for seven long, hot days, and taking forty-six ballots, the\\ndelegates, powerfully influenced by Mr. Bryan, finally decided in favor\\nof the governor. As a professor, a writer on historical and political\\nsubjects, and the president of Princeton University, Mr. Wilson had\\nbecome widely known in public life. As the governor of New Jersey he had\\nattracted the support of the progressives in both parties. With grim\\ndetermination he had \"waged war on the bosses,\" and pushed through the\\nlegislature measures establishing direct primaries, regulating public\\nutilities, and creating a system of workmen\\'s compensation in\\nindustries. During the presidential campaign that followed Governor\\nWilson toured the country and aroused great enthusiasm by a series of\\naddresses later published under the title of _The New Freedom_. He\\ndeclared that \"the government of the United States is at present the\\nfoster child of the special interests.\" He proposed to free the country\\nby breaking the dominance of \"the big bankers, the big manufacturers,\\nthe big masters of commerce, the heads of railroad corporations and of\\nsteamship corporations.\"\\n\\nIn the election Governor Wilson easily secured a majority of the\\nelectoral votes, and his party, while retaining possession of the House\\nof Representatives, captured the Senate as well. The popular verdict,\\nhowever, indicated a state of confusion in the country. The combined\\nProgressive and Republican vote exceeded that of the Democrats by\\n1,300,000. The Socialists, with Eugene V. Debs as their candidate again,\\npolled about 900,000 votes, more than double the number received four\\nyears before. Thus, as the result of an extraordinary upheaval the\\nRepublicans, after holding the office of President for sixteen years,\\npassed out of power, and the government of the country was intrusted to\\nthe Democrats under the leadership of a man destined to be one of the\\noutstanding figures of the modern age, Woodrow Wilson.\\n\\n\\n=General References=\\n\\nJ.B.

It had been\\nlong in preparation. The revolt against corruption in politics which\\nproduced the Liberal Republican outbreak in the seventies and the\\nMugwump movement of the eighties was followed by continuous criticism of\\nAmerican political and economic development. From 1880 until his death\\nin 1892, George William Curtis, as president of the Civil Service Reform\\nAssociation, kept up a running fire upon the abuses of the spoils\\nsystem. James Bryce, an observant English scholar and man of affairs, in\\nhis great work, _The American Commonwealth_, published in 1888, by\\npicturing fearlessly the political rings and machines which dominated\\nthe cities, gave the whole country a fresh shock. Six years later Henry\\nD. Lloyd, in a powerful book entitled _Wealth against Commonwealth_,\\nattacked in scathing language certain trusts which had destroyed their\\nrivals and bribed public officials. In 1903 Miss Ida Tarbell, an author\\nof established reputation in the historical field, gave to the public an\\naccount of the Standard Oil Company, revealing the ruthless methods of\\nthat corporation in crushing competition. About the same time Lincoln\\nSteffens exposed the sordid character of politics in several\\nmunicipalities in a series of articles bearing the painful heading: _The\\nShame of the Cities_. The critical spirit appeared in almost every form;\\nin weekly and monthly magazines, in essays and pamphlets, in editorials\\nand news stories, in novels like Churchill\\'s _Coniston_ and Sinclair\\'s\\n_The Jungle_. It became so savage and so wanton that the opening years\\nof the twentieth century were well named \"the age of the muckrakers.\"\\n\\n=The Subjects of the Criticism.=--In this outburst of invective, nothing\\nwas spared. It was charged that each of the political parties had fallen\\ninto the hands of professional politicians who devoted their time to\\nmanaging conventions, making platforms, nominating candidates, and\\ndictating to officials; in return for their \"services\" they sold offices\\nand privileges. It was alleged that mayors and councils had bargained\\naway for private benefit street railway and other franchises. It was\\nasserted that many powerful labor unions were dominated by men who\\nblackmailed employers. Some critics specialized in descriptions of the\\npoverty, slums, and misery of great cities. Others took up \"frenzied\\nfinance\" and accused financiers of selling worthless stocks and bonds to\\nan innocent public. Still others professed to see in the accumulations\\nof millionaires the downfall of our republic.\\n\\n=The Attack on \"Invisible Government.\"=--Some even maintained that the\\ncontrol of public affairs had passed from the people to a sinister\\nminority called \"the invisible government.\" So eminent and conservative\\na statesman as the Hon. Elihu Root lent the weight of his great name to\\nsuch an imputation. Speaking of his native state, New York, he said:\\n\"What is the government of this state? What has it been during the forty\\nyears of my acquaintance with it? The government of the Constitution?\\nOh, no; not half the time or half way.... From the days of Fenton and\\nConkling and Arthur and Cornell and Platt, from the days of David B.\\nHill down to the present time, the government of the state has presented\\ntwo different lines of activity: one, of the constitutional and\\nstatutory officers of the state and the other of the party leaders; they\\ncall them party bosses. They call the system--I don\\'t coin the\\nphrase--the system they call \\'invisible government.\\' For I don\\'t know\\nhow many years Mr. Conkling was the supreme ruler in this state. The\\ngovernor did not count, the legislature did not count, comptrollers and\\nsecretaries of state and what not did not count. It was what Mr.\\nConkling said, and in a great outburst of public rage he was pulled\\ndown. Then Mr. Platt ruled the state; for nigh upon twenty years he\\nruled it. It was not the governor; it was not the legislature; it was\\nMr. Platt. And the capital was not here [in Albany]; it was at 49\\nBroadway; Mr. Platt and his lieutenants. It makes no difference what\\nname you give, whether you call it Fenton or Conkling or Cornell or\\nArthur or Platt or by the names of men now living. The ruler of the\\nstate during the greater part of the forty years of my acquaintance with\\nthe state government has not been any man authorized by the constitution\\nor by law.... The party leader is elected by no one, accountable to no\\none, bound by no oath of office, removable by no one.\"\\n\\n=The Nation Aroused.=--With the spirit of criticism came also the spirit\\nof reform. The charges were usually exaggerated; often wholly false; but\\nthere was enough truth in them to warrant renewed vigilance on the part\\nof American democracy. President Roosevelt doubtless summed up the\\nsentiment of the great majority of citizens when he demanded the\\npunishment of wrong-doers in 1907, saying: \"It makes not a particle of\\ndifference whether these crimes are committed by a capitalist or by a\\nlaborer, by a leading banker or manufacturer or railroad man or by a\\nleading representative of a labor union. Swindling in stocks, corrupting\\nlegislatures, making fortunes by the inflation of securities, by\\nwrecking railroads, by destroying competitors through rebates--these\\nforms of wrong-doing in the capitalist are far more infamous than any\\nordinary form of embezzlement or forgery.\" The time had come, he added,\\nto stop \"muckraking\" and proceed to the constructive work of removing\\nthe abuses that had grown up.\\n\\n\\nPOLITICAL REFORMS\\n\\n=The Public Service.=--It was a wise comprehension of the needs of\\nAmerican democracy that led the friends of reform to launch and to\\nsustain for more than half a century a movement to improve the public\\nservice. On the one side they struck at the spoils system; at the right\\nof the politicians to use public offices as mere rewards for partisan\\nwork. The federal civil service act of 1883 opened the way to reform by\\nestablishing five vital principles in law: (1) admission to office, not\\non the recommendation of party workers, but on the basis of competitive\\nexaminations; (2) promotion for meritorious service of the government\\nrather than of parties; (3) no assessment of office holders for campaign\\nfunds; (4) permanent tenure during good behavior; and (5) no dismissals\\nfor political reasons. The act itself at first applied to only 14,000\\nfederal offices, but under the constant pressure from the reformers it\\nwas extended until in 1916 it covered nearly 300,000 employees out of an\\nexecutive force of approximately 414,000. While gaining steadily at\\nWashington, civil service reformers carried their agitation into the\\nstates and cities. By 1920 they were able to report ten states with\\ncivil service commissions and the merit system well intrenched in more\\nthan three hundred municipalities.\\n\\nIn excluding spoilsmen from public office, the reformers were, in a\\nsense, engaged in a negative work: that of \"keeping the rascals out.\"\\nBut there was a second and larger phase to their movement, one\\nconstructive in character: that of getting skilled, loyal, and efficient\\nservants into the places of responsibility. Everywhere on land and sea,\\nin town and country, new burdens were laid upon public officers. They\\nwere called upon to supervise the ships sailing to and from our ports;\\nto inspect the water and milk supplies of our cities; to construct and\\noperate great public works, such as the Panama and Erie canals; to\\nregulate the complicated rates of railway companies; to safeguard health\\nand safety in a thousand ways; to climb the mountains to fight forest\\nfires; and to descend into the deeps of the earth to combat the deadly\\ncoal gases that assail the miners. In a word, those who labored to\\nmaster the secrets and the powers of nature were summoned to the aid of\\nthe government: chemists, engineers, architects, nurses, surgeons,\\nforesters--the skilled in all the sciences, arts, and crafts.\\n\\nKeeping rascals out was no task at all compared with the problem of\\nfinding competent people for all the technical offices. \"Now,\" said the\\nreformers, \"we must make attractive careers in the government work for\\nthe best American talent; we must train those applying for admission and\\nincrease the skill of those already in positions of trust; we must see\\nto it that those entering at the bottom have a chance to rise to the\\ntop; in short, we must work for a government as skilled and efficient as\\nit is strong, one commanding all the wisdom and talent of America that\\npublic welfare requires.\"\\n\\n=The Australian Ballot.=--A second line of attack on the political\\nmachines was made in connection with the ballot. In the early days\\nelections were frequently held in the open air and the poll was taken by\\na show of hands or by the enrollment of the voters under names of their\\nfavorite candidates. When this ancient practice was abandoned in favor\\nof the printed ballot, there was still no secrecy about elections. Each\\nparty prepared its own ballot, often of a distinctive color, containing\\nthe names of its candidates. On election day, these papers were handed\\nout to the voters by party workers. Any one could tell from the color of\\nthe ballot dropped into the box, or from some mark on the outside of the\\nfolded ballot, just how each man voted. Those who bought votes were sure\\nthat their purchases were \"delivered.\" Those who intimidated voters\\ncould know when their intimidation was effective. In this way the party\\nballot strengthened the party machine.\\n\\nAs a remedy for such abuses, reformers, learning from the experience of\\nAustralia, urged the adoption of the \"Australian ballot.\" That ballot,\\nthough it appeared in many forms, had certain constant features. It was\\nofficial, that is, furnished by the government, not by party workers; it\\ncontained the names of all candidates of all parties; it was given out\\nonly in the polling places; and it was marked in secret. The first state\\nto introduce it was Massachusetts. The year was 1888. Before the end of\\nthe century it had been adopted by nearly all the states in the union.\\nThe salutary effect of the reform in reducing the amount of cheating\\nand bribery in elections was beyond all question.\\n\\n=The Direct Primary.=--In connection with the uprising against machine\\npolitics, came a call for the abolition of the old method of nominating\\ncandidates by conventions. These time-honored party assemblies, which\\nhad come down from the days of Andrew Jackson, were, it was said, merely\\nconclaves of party workers, sustained by the spoils system, and\\ndominated by an inner circle of bosses. The remedy offered in this case\\nwas again \"more democracy,\" namely, the abolition of the party\\nconvention and the adoption of the direct primary. Candidates were no\\nlonger to be chosen by secret conferences. Any member of a party was to\\nbe allowed to run for any office, to present his name to his party by\\nsecuring signatures to a petition, and to submit his candidacy to his\\nfellow partisans at a direct primary--an election within the party. In\\nthis movement Governor La Follette of Wisconsin took the lead and his\\nstate was the first in the union to adopt the direct primary for\\nstate-wide purposes. The idea spread, rapidly in the West, more slowly\\nin the East. The public, already angered against \"the bosses,\" grasped\\neagerly at it. Governor Hughes in New York pressed it upon the unwilling\\nlegislature. State after state accepted it until by 1918 Rhode Island,\\nDelaware, Connecticut, and New Mexico were the only states that had not\\nbowed to the storm. Still the results were disappointing and at that\\nvery time the pendulum was beginning to swing backward.\\n\\n=Popular Election of Federal Senators.=--While the movement for direct\\nprimaries was still advancing everywhere, a demand for the popular\\nelection of Senators, usually associated with it, swept forward to\\nvictory. Under the original Constitution, it had been expressly provided\\nthat Senators should be chosen by the legislatures of the states. In\\npractice this rule transferred the selection of Senators to secret\\ncaucuses of party members in the state legislatures. In connection with\\nthese caucuses there had been many scandals, some direct proofs of\\nbrazen bribery and corruption, and dark hints besides. The Senate was\\ncalled by its detractors \"a millionaires\\' club\" and it was looked upon\\nas the \"citadel of conservatism.\" The prescription in this case was\\nlikewise \"more democracy\"--direct election of Senators by popular vote.\\n\\nThis reform was not a new idea. It had been proposed in Congress as\\nearly as 1826. President Johnson, an ardent advocate, made it the\\nsubject of a special message in 1868 Not long afterward it appeared in\\nCongress. At last in 1893, the year after the great Populist upheaval,\\nthe House of Representatives by the requisite two-thirds vote\\nincorporated it in an amendment to the federal Constitution. Again and\\nagain it passed the House; but the Senate itself was obdurate. Able\\nSenators leveled their batteries against it. Mr. Hoar of Massachusetts\\ndeclared that it would transfer the seat of power to the \"great cities\\nand masses of population\"; that it would \"overthrow the whole scheme of\\nthe Senate and in the end the whole scheme of the national Constitution\\nas designed and established by the framers of the Constitution and the\\npeople who adopted it.\"\\n\\nFailing in the Senate, advocates of popular election made a rear assault\\nthrough the states. They induced state legislatures to enact laws\\nrequiring the nomination of candidates for the Senate by the direct\\nprimary, and then they bound the legislatures to abide by the popular\\nchoice. Nevada took the lead in 1899. Shortly afterward Oregon, by the\\nuse of the initiative and referendum, practically bound legislators to\\naccept the popular nominee and the country witnessed the spectacle of a\\nRepublican legislature \"electing\" a Democrat to represent the state in\\nthe Senate at Washington. By 1910 three-fourths of the states had\\napplied the direct primary in some form to the choice of Senators. Men\\nselected by that method began to pour in upon the floors of Congress;\\nfinally in 1912 the two-thirds majority was secured for an amendment to\\nthe federal Constitution providing for the popular election of Senators.\\nIt was quickly ratified by the states. The following year it was\\nproclaimed in effect.\\n\\n=The Initiative and Referendum.=--As a corrective for the evils which\\nhad grown up in state legislatures there arose a demand for the\\nintroduction of a Swiss device known as the initiative and referendum.\\nThe initiative permits any one to draw up a proposed bill; and, on\\nsecuring a certain number of signatures among the voters, to require the\\nsubmission of the measure to the people at an election. If the bill thus\\ninitiated receives a sufficient majority, it becomes a law. The\\nreferendum allows citizens who disapprove any act passed by the\\nlegislature to get up a petition against it and thus bring about a\\nreference of the measure to the voters at the polls for approval or\\nrejection. These two practices constitute a form of \"direct government.\"\\n\\nThese devices were prescribed \"to restore the government to the people.\"\\nThe Populists favored them in their platform of 1896. Mr. Bryan, two\\nyears later, made them a part of his program, and in the same year South\\nDakota adopted them. In 1902 Oregon, after a strenuous campaign, added a\\ndirect legislation amendment to the state constitution. Within ten years\\nall the Southwestern, Mountain, and Pacific states, except Texas and\\nWyoming, had followed this example. To the east of the Mississippi,\\nhowever, direct legislation met a chilly reception. By 1920 only five\\nstates in this section had accepted it: Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio,\\nMichigan, and Maryland, the last approving the referendum only.\\n\\n=The Recall.=--Executive officers and judges, as well as legislatures,\\nhad come in for their share of criticism, and it was proposed that they\\nshould likewise be subjected to a closer scrutiny by the public. For\\nthis purpose there was advanced a scheme known as the recall--which\\npermitted a certain percentage of the voters to compel any officer, at\\nany time during his term, to go before the people at a new election.\\nThis feature of direct government, tried out first in the city of Los\\nAngeles, was extended to state-wide uses in Oregon in 1908. It failed,\\nhowever, to capture popular imagination to the same degree as the\\ninitiative and referendum. At the end of ten years\\' agitation, only ten\\nstates, mainly in the West, had adopted it for general purposes, and\\nfour of them did not apply it to the judges of the courts. Still it was\\nextensively acclaimed in cities and incorporated into hundreds of\\nmunicipal laws and charters.\\n\\nAs a general proposition, direct government in all its forms was\\nbitterly opposed by men of a conservative cast of mind. It was denounced\\nby Senator Henry Cabot Lodge as \"nothing less than a complete revolution\\nin the fabric of our government and in the fundamental principles upon\\nwhich that government rests.\" In his opinion, it promised to break down\\nthe representative principle and \"undermine and overthrow the bulwarks\\nof ordered liberty and individual freedom.\" Mr. Taft shared Mr. Lodge\\'s\\nviews and spoke of direct government with scorn. \"Votes,\" he exclaimed,\\n\"are not bread ... referendums do not pay rent or furnish houses,\\nrecalls do not furnish clothes, initiatives do not supply employment or\\nrelieve inequalities of condition or of opportunity.\"\\n\\n=Commission Government for Cities.=--In the restless searching out of\\nevils, the management of cities early came under critical scrutiny. City\\ngovernment, Mr. Bryce had remarked, was the one conspicuous failure in\\nAmerica. This sharp thrust, though resented by some, was accepted as a\\nwarning by others. Many prescriptions were offered by doctors of the\\nbody politic. Chief among them was the idea of simplifying the city\\ngovernment so that the light of public scrutiny could shine through it.\\n\"Let us elect only a few men and make them clearly responsible for the\\ncity government!\" was the new cry in municipal reform. So, many city\\ncouncils were reduced in size; one of the two houses, which several\\ncities had adopted in imitation of the federal government, was\\nabolished; and in order that the mayor could be held to account, he was\\ngiven the power to appoint all the chief officials. This made the mayor,\\nin some cases, the only elective city official and gave the voters a\\n\"short ballot\" containing only a few names--an idea which some proposed\\nto apply also to the state government.\\n\\nA further step in the concentration of authority was taken in Galveston,\\nTexas, where the people, looking upon the ruin of their city wrought by\\nthe devastating storm of 1901, and confronted by the difficult problems\\nof reconstruction, felt the necessity for a more businesslike management\\nof city affairs and instituted a new form of local administration. They\\nabolished the old scheme of mayor and council and vested all power in\\nfive commissioners, one of whom, without any special prerogatives, was\\nassigned to the office of \"mayor president.\" In 1908, the commission\\nform of government, as it was soon characterized, was adopted by Des\\nMoines, Iowa. The attention of all municipal reformers was drawn to it\\nand it was hailed as the guarantee of a better day. By 1920, more than\\nfour hundred cities, including Memphis, Spokane, Birmingham, Newark, and\\nBuffalo, had adopted it. Still the larger cities like New York and\\nChicago kept their boards of aldermen.\\n\\n=The City Manager Plan.=--A few years\\' experience with commission\\ngovernment revealed certain patent defects. The division of the work\\namong five men was frequently found to introduce dissensions and\\nirresponsibility. Commissioners were often lacking in the technical\\nability required to manage such difficult matters as fire and police\\nprotection, public health, public works, and public utilities. Some one\\nthen proposed to carry over into city government an idea from the\\nbusiness world. In that sphere the stockholders of each corporation\\nelect the directors and the directors, in turn, choose a business\\nmanager to conduct the affairs of the company. It was suggested that the\\ncity commissioners, instead of attempting to supervise the details of\\nthe city administration, should select a manager to do this. The scheme\\nwas put into effect in Sumter, South Carolina, in 1912. Like the\\ncommission plan, it became popular. Within eight years more than one\\nhundred and fifty towns and cities had adopted it. Among the larger\\nmunicipalities were Dayton, Springfield (Ohio), Akron, Kalamazoo, and\\nPhoenix. It promised to create a new public service profession, that of\\ncity manager.\\n\\n\\nMEASURES OF ECONOMIC REFORM\\n\\n=The Spirit of American Reform.=--The purification of the ballot, the\\nrestriction of the spoils system, the enlargement of direct popular\\ncontrol over the organs of government were not the sole answers made by\\nthe reformers to the critics of American institutions. Nor were they the\\nmost important. In fact, they were regarded not as ends in themselves,\\nbut as means to serve a wider purpose. That purpose was the promotion of\\nthe \"general welfare.\" The concrete objects covered by that broad term\\nwere many and varied; but they included the prevention of extortion by\\nrailway and other corporations, the protection of public health, the\\nextension of education, the improvement of living conditions in the\\ncities, the elimination of undeserved poverty, the removal of gross\\ninequalities in wealth, and more equality of opportunity.\\n\\nAll these things involved the use of the powers of government. Although\\na few clung to the ancient doctrine that the government should not\\ninterfere with private business at all, the American people at large\\nrejected that theory as vigorously as they rejected the doctrines of an\\nextreme socialism which exalts the state above the individual. Leaders\\nrepresenting every shade of opinion proclaimed the government an\\ninstrument of common welfare to be used in the public interest. \"We must\\nabandon definitely,\" said Roosevelt, \"the _laissez-faire_ theory of\\npolitical economy and fearlessly champion a system of increased\\ngovernmental control, paying no attention to the cries of worthy people\\nwho denounce this as socialistic.\" This view was shared by Mr. Taft, who\\nobserved: \"Undoubtedly the government can wisely do much more ... to\\nrelieve the oppressed, to create greater equality of opportunity, to\\nmake reasonable terms for labor in employment, and to furnish vocational\\neducation.\" He was quick to add his caution that \"there is a line beyond\\nwhich the government cannot go with any good practical results in\\nseeking to make men and society better.\"\\n\\n=The Regulation of Railways.=--The first attempts to use the government\\nin a large way to control private enterprise in the public interest were\\nmade by the Northwestern states in the decade between 1870 and 1880.\\nCharges were advanced by the farmers, particularly those organized into\\nGranges, that the railways extorted the highest possible rates for\\nfreight and passengers, that favoritism was shown to large shippers,\\nthat fraudulent stocks and bonds were sold to the innocent public. It\\nwas claimed that railways were not like other enterprises, but were\\n\"quasi-public\" concerns, like the roads and ferries, and thus subject to\\ngovernment control. Accordingly laws were enacted bringing the railroads\\nunder state supervision. In some cases the state legislature fixed the\\nmaximum rates to be charged by common carriers, and in other cases\\ncommissions were created with the power to establish the rates after an\\ninvestigation. This legislation was at first denounced in the East as\\nnothing less than the \"confiscation\" of the railways in the interest of\\nthe farmers. Attempts to have the Supreme Court of the United States\\ndeclare it unconstitutional were made without avail; still a principle\\nwas finally laid down to the effect that in fixing rates state\\nlegislatures and commissions must permit railway companies to earn a\\n\"fair\" return on the capital invested.\\n\\nIn a few years the Granger spirit appeared in Congress. An investigation\\nrevealed a long list of abuses committed by the railways against\\nshippers and travelers. The result was the interstate commerce act of\\n1887, which created the Interstate Commerce Commission, forbade\\ndiscriminations in rates, and prohibited other objectionable practices\\non the part of railways. This measure was loosely enforced and the\\nabuses against which it was directed continued almost unabated. A demand\\nfor stricter control grew louder and louder. Congress was forced to\\nheed. In 1903 it enacted the Elkins law, forbidding railways to charge\\nrates other than those published, and laid penalties upon the officers\\nand agents of companies, who granted secret favors to shippers, and upon\\nshippers who accepted them. Three years later a still more drastic step\\nwas taken by the passage of the Hepburn act. The Interstate Commerce\\nCommission was authorized, upon complaint of some party aggrieved, and\\nafter a public hearing, to determine whether just and reasonable rates\\nhad been charged by the companies. In effect, the right to fix freight\\nand passenger rates was taken out of the hands of the owners of the\\nrailways engaged in interstate commerce and vested in the hands of the\\nInterstate Commerce Commission. Thus private property to the value of\\n$20,000,000,000 or more was declared to be a matter of public concern\\nand subject to government regulation in the common interest.\\n\\n=Municipal Utilities.=--Similar problems arose in connection with the\\nstreet railways, electric light plants, and other utilities in the great\\ncities. In the beginning the right to construct such undertakings was\\nfreely, and often corruptly, granted to private companies by city\\ncouncils. Distressing abuses arose in connection with such practices.\\nMany grants or franchises were made perpetual, or perhaps for a term of\\n999 years. The rates charged and services rendered were left largely to\\nthe will of the companies holding the franchises. Mergers or unions of\\ncompanies were common and the public was deluged with stocks and bonds\\nof doubtful value; bankruptcies were frequent. The connection between\\nthe utility companies and the politicians was, to say the least, not\\nalways in the public interest.\\n\\nAmerican ingenuity was quick to devise methods for eliminating such\\nevils. Three lines of progress were laid out by the reformers. One group\\nproposed that such utilities should be subject to municipal or state\\nregulation, that the formation of utility companies should be under\\npublic control, and that the issue of stocks and bonds must be approved\\nby public authority. In some cases state, and in other cases municipal,\\ncommissions were created to exercise this great power over \"quasi-public\\ncorporations.\" Wisconsin, by laws enacted in 1907, put all heat, light,\\nwater works, telephone, and street railway companies under the\\nsupervision of a single railway commission. Other states followed this\\nexample rapidly. By 1920 the principle of public control over municipal\\nutilities was accepted in nearly every section of the union.\\n\\nA second line of reform appeared in the \"model franchise\" for utility\\ncorporations. An illustration of this tendency was afforded by the\\nChicago street railway settlement of 1906. The total capital of the\\ncompany was fixed at a definite sum, its earnings were agreed upon, and\\nthe city was given the right to buy and operate the system if it desired\\nto do so. In many states, about the same time, it was provided that no\\nfranchises to utility companies could run more than twenty-five years.\\n\\nA third group of reformers were satisfied with nothing short of\\nmunicipal ownership. They proposed to drive private companies entirely\\nout of the field and vest the ownership and management of municipal\\nplants in the city itself. This idea was extensively applied to electric\\nlight and water works plants, but to street railways in only a few\\ncities, including San Francisco and Seattle. In New York the subways are\\nowned by the city but leased for operation.\\n\\n=Tenement House Control.=--Among the other pressing problems of the\\ncities was the overcrowding in houses unfit for habitation. An inquiry\\nin New York City made under the authority of the state in 1902 revealed\\npoverty, misery, slums, dirt, and disease almost beyond imagination. The\\nimmediate answer was the enactment of a tenement house law prescribing\\nin great detail the size of the rooms, the air space, the light and the\\nsanitary arrangement for all new buildings. An immense improvement\\nfollowed and the idea was quickly taken up in other states having large\\nindustrial centers. In 1920 New York made a further invasion of the\\nrights of landlords by assuring to the public \"reasonable rents\" for\\nflats and apartments.\\n\\n=Workmen\\'s Compensation.=--No small part of the poverty in cities was\\ndue to the injury of wage-earners while at their trade. Every year the\\nnumber of men and women killed or wounded in industry mounted higher.\\nUnder the old law, the workman or his family had to bear the loss unless\\nthe employer had been guilty of some extraordinary negligence. Even in\\nthat case an expensive lawsuit was usually necessary to recover\\n\"damages.\" In short, although employers insured their buildings and\\nmachinery against necessary risks from fire and storm, they allowed\\ntheir employees to assume the heavy losses due to accidents. The\\ninjustice of this, though apparent enough now, was once not generally\\nrecognized. It was said to be unfair to make the employer pay for\\ninjuries for which he was not personally responsible; but the argument\\nwas overborne.\\n\\n[Illustration: AN EAST SIDE STREET IN NEW YORK]\\n\\nAbout 1910 there set in a decided movement in the direction of lifting\\nthe burden of accidents from the unfortunate victims. In the first\\nplace, laws were enacted requiring employers to pay damages in certain\\namounts according to the nature of the case, no matter how the accident\\noccurred, as long as the injured person was not guilty of willful\\nnegligence. By 1914 more than one-half the states had such laws. In the\\nsecond place, there developed schemes of industrial insurance in the\\nform of automatic grants made by state commissions to persons injured in\\nindustries, the funds to be provided by the employers or the state or by\\nboth. By 1917 thirty-six states had legislation of this type.\\n\\n=Minimum Wages and Mothers\\' Pensions.=--Another source of poverty,\\nespecially among women and children, was found to be the low wages paid\\nfor their labor. Report after report showed this. In 1912 Massachusetts\\ntook a significant step in the direction of declaring the minimum wages\\nwhich might be paid to women and children. Oregon, the following year,\\ncreated a commission with power to prescribe minimum wages in certain\\nindustries, based on the cost of living, and to enforce the rates fixed.\\nWithin a short time one-third of the states had legislation of this\\ncharacter. To cut away some of the evils of poverty and enable widows to\\nkeep their homes intact and bring up their children, a device known as\\nmothers\\' pensions became popular during the second decade of the\\ntwentieth century. At the opening of 1913 two states, Colorado and\\nIllinois, had laws authorizing the payment from public funds of definite\\nsums to widows with children. Within four years, thirty-five states had\\nsimilar legislation.\\n\\n=Taxation and Great Fortunes.=--As a part of the campaign waged against\\npoverty by reformers there came a demand for heavy taxes upon great\\nfortunes, particularly taxes upon inheritances or estates passing to\\nheirs on the decease of the owners. Roosevelt was an ardent champion of\\nthis type of taxation and dwelt upon it at length in his message to\\nCongress in 1907. \"Such a tax,\" he said, \"would help to preserve a\\nmeasurable equality of opportunity for the people of the generations\\ngrowing to manhood.... Our aim is to recognize what Lincoln pointed out:\\nthe fact that there are some respects in which men are obviously not\\nequal; but also to insist that there should be equality of self-respect\\nand of mutual respect, an equality of rights before the law, and at\\nleast an approximate equality in the conditions under which each man\\nobtains the chance to show the stuff that is in him when compared with\\nhis fellows.\"\\n\\nThe spirit of the new age was, therefore, one of reform, not of\\nrevolution. It called for no evolutionary or utopian experiments, but\\nfor the steady and progressive enactment of measures aimed at admitted\\nabuses and designed to accomplish tangible results in the name of public\\nwelfare.\\n\\n\\n=General References=\\n\\nJ.

Where they did not\\nlead, they were affiliated with movements for social improvement. No\\ncause escaped their attention; no year passed without widening the range\\nof their interests. They served on committees that inquired into the\\nproblems of the day; they appeared before legislative assemblies to\\nadvocate remedies for the evils they discovered. By 1912 they were a\\nforce to be reckoned with in national politics. In nine states complete\\nand equal suffrage had been established, and a widespread campaign for a\\nnational suffrage amendment was in full swing. On every hand lay\\nevidences that their sphere had been broadened to include public\\naffairs. This was the culmination of forces that had long been\\noperating.\\n\\n=A New Emphasis in History.=--A movement so deeply affecting important\\ninterests could not fail to find a place in time in the written record\\nof human progress. History often began as a chronicle of kings and\\nqueens, knights and ladies, written partly to amuse and partly to\\ninstruct the classes that appeared in its pages. With the growth of\\ncommerce, parliaments, and international relations, politics and\\ndiplomacy were added to such chronicles of royal and princely doings.\\nAfter the rise of democracy, industry, and organized labor, the\\ntransactions of everyday life were deemed worthy of a place in the pages\\nof history. In each case history was rewritten and the past rediscovered\\nin the light of the new age. So it will be with the rise and growth of\\nwomen\\'s political power. The history of their labor, their education,\\ntheir status in society, their influence on the course of events will be\\nexplored and given its place in the general record.\\n\\nIt will be a history of change. The superior position which women enjoy\\nin America to-day is the result of a slow evolution from an almost\\nrightless condition in colonial times. The founders of America brought\\nwith them the English common law. Under that law, a married woman\\'s\\npersonal property--jewels, money, furniture, and the like--became her\\nhusband\\'s property; the management of her lands passed into his control.\\nEven the wages she earned, if she worked for some one else, belonged to\\nhim. Custom, if not law, prescribed that women should not take part in\\ntown meetings or enter into public discussions of religious questions.\\nIndeed it is a far cry from the banishment of Anne Hutchinson from\\nMassachusetts in 1637, for daring to dispute with the church fathers, to\\nthe political conventions of 1920 in which women sat as delegates, made\\nnominating speeches, and served on committees. In the contrast between\\nthese two scenes may be measured the change in the privileges of women\\nsince the landing of the Pilgrims. The account of this progress is a\\nnarrative of individual effort on the part of women, of organizations\\namong them, of generous aid from sympathetic men in the long agitation\\nfor the removal of civil and political disabilities. It is in part also\\na narrative of irresistible economic change which drew women into\\nindustry, created a leisure class, gave women wages and incomes, and\\ntherewith economic independence.\\n\\n\\nTHE RISE OF THE WOMAN MOVEMENT\\n\\n=Protests of Colonial Women.=--The republican spirit which produced\\nAmerican independence was of slow and steady growth. It did not spring\\nup full-armed in a single night. It was, on the contrary, nourished\\nduring a long period of time by fireside discussions as well as by\\ndebates in the public forum. Women shared that fireside sifting of\\npolitical principles and passed on the findings of that scrutiny in\\nletters to their friends, newspaper articles, and every form of written\\nword. How widespread was this potent, though not spectacular force, is\\nrevealed in the collections of women\\'s letters, articles, songs, dramas,\\nand satirical \"skits\" on English rule that have come down to us. In this\\nsearch into the reasons of government, some women began to take thought\\nabout laws that excluded them from the ballot. Two women at least left\\ntheir protests on record. Abigail, the ingenious and witty wife of John\\nAdams, wrote to her husband, in March, 1776, that women objected \"to all\\narbitrary power whether of state or males\" and demanded political\\nprivileges in the new order then being created. Hannah Lee Corbin, the\\nsister of \"Lighthorse\" Harry Lee, protested to her brother against the\\ntaxation of women without representation.\\n\\n[Illustration: ABIGAIL ADAMS]\\n\\n=The Stir among European Women.=--Ferment in America, in the case of\\nwomen as of men, was quickened by events in Europe. In 1792, Mary\\nWollstonecraft published in England the _Vindication of the Rights of\\nWomen_--a book that was destined to serve the cause of liberty among\\nwomen as the writings of Locke and Paine had served that of men. The\\nspecific grievances which stirred English women were men\\'s invasion of\\nwomen\\'s industries, such as spinning and weaving; the denial of equal\\neducational opportunities; and political disabilities. In France also\\nthe great Revolution raised questionings about the status of women. The\\nrights of \"citizenesses\" as well as the rights of \"citizens\" were\\nexamined by the boldest thinkers. This in turn reacted upon women in the\\nUnited States.\\n\\n=Leadership in America.=--The origins of the American woman movement are\\nto be found in the writings of a few early intellectual leaders. During\\nthe first decades of the nineteenth century, books, articles, and\\npamphlets about women came in increasing numbers from the press. Lydia\\nMaria Child wrote a history of women; Margaret Fuller made a critical\\nexamination of the status of women in her time; and Mrs. Elizabeth Ellet\\nsupplemented the older histories by showing what an important part women\\nhad played in the American Revolution.\\n\\n=The Struggle for Education.=--Along with criticism, there was carried\\non a constructive struggle for better educational facilities for women\\nwho had been from the beginning excluded from every college in the\\ncountry. In this long battle, Emma Willard and Mary Lyon led the way;\\nthe former founded a seminary at Troy, New York; and the latter made the\\nbeginnings of Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. Oberlin College in\\nOhio, established in 1833, opened its doors to girls and from it were\\ngraduated young students to lead in the woman movement. Sarah J. Hale,\\nwho in 1827 became the editor of a \"Ladies\\' Magazine,\" published in\\nBoston, conducted a campaign for equal educational opportunities which\\nhelped to bear fruit in the founding of Vassar College shortly after the\\nCivil War.\\n\\n=The Desire to Effect Reforms.=--As they came to study their own history\\nand their own part in civilization, women naturally became deeply\\ninterested in all the controversies going on around them. The temperance\\nquestion made a special appeal to them and they organized to demand the\\nright to be heard on it. In 1846 the \"Daughters of Temperance\" formed a\\nsecret society favoring prohibition. They dared to criticize the\\nchurches for their indifference and were so bold as to ask that\\ndrunkenness be made a ground for divorce.\\n\\nThe slavery issue even more than temperance called women into public\\nlife. The Grimke sisters of South Carolina emancipated their bondmen,\\nand one of these sisters, exiled from Charleston for her \"Appeal to the\\nChristian Women of the South,\" went North to work against the slavery\\nsystem. In 1837 the National Women\\'s Anti-Slavery Convention met in New\\nYork; seventy-one women delegates represented eight states. Three years\\nlater eight American women, five of them in Quaker costume, attended the\\nWorld Anti-Slavery Convention in London, much to the horror of the men,\\nwho promptly excluded them from the sessions on the ground that it was\\nnot fitting for women to take part in such meetings.\\n\\nIn other spheres of activity, especially social service, women steadily\\nenlarged their interest. Nothing human did they consider alien to them.\\nThey inveighed against cruel criminal laws and unsanitary prisons. They\\norganized poor relief and led in private philanthropy. Dorothea Dix\\ndirected the movement that induced the New York legislature to establish\\nin 1845 a separate asylum for the criminal insane. In the same year\\nSarah G. Bagley organized the Lowell Female Reform Association for the\\npurpose of reducing the long hours of labor for women, safeguarding \"the\\nconstitutions of future generations.\" Mrs. Eliza Woodson Farnham, matron\\nin Sing Sing penitentiary, was known throughout the nation for her\\nsocial work, especially prison reform. Wherever there were misery and\\nsuffering, women were preparing programs of relief.\\n\\n=Freedom of Speech for Women.=--In the advancement of their causes, of\\nwhatever kind, women of necessity had to make public appeals and take\\npart in open meetings. Here they encountered difficulties. The\\nappearance of women on the platform was new and strange. Naturally it\\nwas widely resented. Antoinette Brown, although she had credentials as a\\ndelegate, was driven off the platform of a temperance convention in New\\nYork City simply because she was a woman. James Russell Lowell, editor\\nof the \"Atlantic Monthly,\" declined a poem from Julia Ward Howe on the\\ntheory that no woman could write a poem; but he added on second thought\\nthat he might consider an article in prose. Nathaniel Hawthorne,\\nanother editor, even objected to something in prose because to him \"all\\nink-stained women were equally detestable.\" To the natural resentment\\nagainst their intrusion into new fields was added that aroused by their\\nideas and methods. As temperance reformers, they criticized in a caustic\\nmanner those who would not accept their opinions. As opponents of\\nslavery they were especially bitter. One of their conventions, held at\\nPhiladelphia in 1833, passed a resolution calling on all women to leave\\nthose churches that would not condemn every form of human bondage. This\\nstirred against them many of the clergy who, accustomed to having women\\nsit silent during services, were in no mood to treat such a revolt\\nleniently. Then came the last straw. Women decided that they would\\npreach--out of the pulpit first, and finally in it.\\n\\n=Women in Industry.=--The period of this ferment was also the age of the\\nindustrial revolution in America, the rise of the factory system, and\\nthe growth of mill towns. The labor of women was transferred from the\\nhomes to the factories. Then arose many questions: the hours of labor,\\nthe sanitary conditions of the mills, the pressure of foreign\\nimmigration on native labor, the wages of women as compared with those\\nof men, and the right of married women to their own earnings. Labor\\norganizations sprang up among working women. The mill girls of Lowell,\\nMassachusetts, mainly the daughters of New England farmers, published a\\nmagazine, \"The Lowell Offering.\" So excellent were their writings that\\nthe French statesman, Thiers, carried a copy of their paper into the\\nChamber of Deputies to show what working women could achieve in a\\nrepublic. As women were now admittedly earning their own way in the\\nworld by their own labor, they began to talk of their \"economic\\nindependence.\"\\n\\n=The World Shaken by Revolution.=--Such was the quickening of women\\'s\\nminds in 1848 when the world was startled once more by a revolution in\\nFrance which spread to Germany, Poland, Austria, Hungary, and Italy.\\nOnce more the people of the earth began to explore the principles of\\ndemocracy and expound human rights. Women, now better educated and more\\n\"advanced\" in their ideas, played a role of still greater importance in\\nthat revolution. They led in agitations and uprisings. They suffered\\nfrom reaction and persecution. From their prison in France, two of them\\nwho had been jailed for too much insistence on women\\'s rights exchanged\\ngreetings with American women who were raising the same issue here. By\\nthis time the women had more supporters among the men. Horace Greeley,\\neditor of the New York _Tribune_, though he afterwards recanted, used\\nhis powerful pen in their behalf. Anti-slavery leaders welcomed their\\naid and repaid them by urging the enfranchisement of women.\\n\\n=The Woman\\'s Rights Convention of 1848.=--The forces, moral and\\nintellectual, which had been stirring among women, crystallized a few\\nmonths after the outbreak of the European revolution in the first\\nWoman\\'s Rights Convention in the history of America. It met at Seneca\\nFalls, New York, in 1848, on the call of Lucretia Mott, Martha Wright,\\nElizabeth Cady Stanton, and Mary Ann McClintock, three of them Quakers.\\nAccustomed to take part in church meetings with men, the Quakers\\nnaturally suggested that men as well as women be invited to attend the\\nconvention. Indeed, a man presided over the conference, for that\\nposition seemed too presumptuous even for such stout advocates of\\nwoman\\'s rights.\\n\\nThe deliberations of the Seneca Falls convention resulted in a\\nDeclaration of Rights modeled after the Declaration of Independence. For\\nexample, the preamble began: \"When in the course of human events it\\nbecomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among\\nthe people of the earth a position different from that which they have\\nhitherto occupied....\" So also it closed: \"Such has been the patient\\nsuffering of women under this government and such is now the necessity\\nwhich constrains them to demand the equal station to which they are\\nentitled.\" Then followed the list of grievances, the same number which\\nhad been exhibited to George III in 1776. Especially did they assail the\\ndisabilities imposed upon them by the English common law imported into\\nAmerica--the law which denied married women their property, their wages,\\nand their legal existence as separate persons. All these grievances they\\nrecited to \"a candid world.\" The remedies for the evils which they\\nendured were then set forth in detail. They demanded \"equal rights\" in\\nthe colleges, trades, and professions; equal suffrage; the right to\\nshare in all political offices, honors, and emoluments; the right to\\ncomplete equality in marriage, including equal guardianship of the\\nchildren; and for married women the right to own property, to keep\\nwages, to make contracts, to transact business, and to testify in the\\ncourts of justice. In short, they declared women to be persons as men\\nare persons and entitled to all the rights and privileges of human\\nbeings. Such was the clarion call which went forth to the world in\\n1848--to an amused and contemptuous world, it must be admitted--but to a\\nworld fated to heed and obey.\\n\\n=The First Gains in Civil Liberty.=--The convention of 1848 did not make\\npolitical enfranchisement the leading issue. Rather did it emphasize the\\ncivil disabilities of women which were most seriously under discussion\\nat the time. Indeed, the New York legislature of that very year, as the\\nresult of a twelve years\\' agitation, passed the Married Woman\\'s Property\\nAct setting aside the general principles of the English common law as\\napplied to women and giving them many of the \"rights of man.\" California\\nand Wisconsin followed in 1850; Massachusetts in 1854; and Kansas in\\n1859. Other states soon fell into line. Women\\'s earnings and\\ninheritances were at last their own in some states at least. In a little\\nwhile laws were passed granting women rights as equal guardians of their\\nchildren and permitting them to divorce their husbands on the grounds of\\ncruelty and drunkenness.\\n\\nBy degrees other steps were taken. The Woman\\'s Medical College of\\nPennsylvania was founded in 1850, and the Philadelphia School of Design\\nfor Women three years later. In 1852 the American Women\\'s Educational\\nAssociation was formed to initiate an agitation for enlarged\\neducational opportunities for women. Other colleges soon emulated the\\nexample of Oberlin: the University of Utah in 1850; Hillsdale College in\\nMichigan in 1855; Baker University in Kansas in 1858; and the University\\nof Iowa in 1860. New trades and professions were opened to women and old\\nprejudices against their activities and demands slowly gave way.\\n\\n\\nTHE NATIONAL STRUGGLE FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE\\n\\n=The Beginnings of Organization.=--As women surmounted one obstacle\\nafter another, the agitation for equal suffrage came to the front. If\\nany year is to be fixed as the date of its beginning, it may very well\\nbe 1850, when the suffragists of Ohio urged the state constitutional\\nconvention to confer the vote upon them. With apparent spontaneity there\\nwere held in the same year state suffrage conferences in Indiana,\\nPennsylvania, and Massachusetts; and connections were formed among the\\nleaders of these meetings. At the same time the first national suffrage\\nconvention was held in Worcester, Massachusetts, on the call of\\neighty-nine leading men and women representing six states. Accounts of\\nthe convention were widely circulated in this country and abroad.\\nEnglish women,--for instance, Harriet Martineau,--sent words of\\nappreciation for the work thus inaugurated. It inspired a leading\\narticle in the \"Westminster Review,\" which deeply interested the\\ndistinguished economist, John Stuart Mill. Soon he was the champion of\\nwoman suffrage in the British Parliament and the author of a powerful\\ntract _The Subjection of Women_, widely read throughout the\\nEnglish-speaking world. Thus do world movements grow. Strange to relate\\nthe women of England were enfranchised before the adoption of the\\nfederal suffrage amendment in America.\\n\\nThe national suffrage convention of 1850 was followed by an\\nextraordinary outburst of agitation. Pamphlets streamed from the press.\\nPetitions to legislative bodies were drafted, signed, and presented.\\nThere were addresses by favorite orators like Garrison, Phillips, and\\nCurtis, and lectures and poems by men like Emerson, Longfellow, and\\nWhittier. In 1853 the first suffrage paper was founded by the wife of a\\nmember of Congress from Rhode Island. By this time the last barrier to\\nwhite manhood suffrage in the North had been swept away and the woman\\'s\\nmovement was gaining momentum every year.\\n\\n=The Suffrage Movement Checked by the Civil War.=--Advocates of woman\\nsuffrage believed themselves on the high road to success when the Civil\\nWar engaged the energies and labors of the nation. Northern women became\\nabsorbed in the struggle to preserve the union. They held no suffrage\\nconventions for five years. They transformed their associations into\\nLoyalty Leagues. They banded together to buy only domestic goods when\\nforeign imports threatened to ruin American markets. They rolled up\\nmonster petitions in favor of the emancipation of slaves. In hospitals,\\nin military prisons, in agriculture, and in industry they bore their\\nfull share of responsibility. Even when the New York legislature took\\nadvantage of their unguarded moments and repealed the law giving the\\nmother equal rights with the father in the guardianship of children,\\nthey refused to lay aside war work for agitation. As in all other wars,\\ntheir devotion was unstinted and their sacrifices equal to the\\nnecessities of the hour.\\n\\n=The Federal Suffrage Amendment.=--Their plans and activities, when the\\nwar closed, were shaped by events beyond their control. The emancipation\\nof the slaves and their proposed enfranchisement made prominent the\\nquestion of a national suffrage for the first time in our history.\\nFriends of the colored man insisted that his civil liberties would not\\nbe safe unless he was granted the right to vote. The woman suffragists\\nvery pertinently asked why the same principle did not apply to women.\\nThe answer which they received was negative. The fourteenth amendment to\\nthe federal Constitution, adopted in 1868, definitely put women aside by\\nlimiting the scope of its application, so far as the suffrage was\\nconcerned, to the male sex. In making manhood suffrage national,\\nhowever, it nationalized the issue.\\n\\nThis was the signal for the advocates of woman suffrage. In March, 1869,\\ntheir proposed amendment was introduced in Congress by George W. Julian\\nof Indiana. It provided that no citizen should be deprived of the vote\\non account of sex, following the language of the fifteenth amendment\\nwhich forbade disfranchisement on account of race. Support for the\\namendment, coming from many directions, led the suffragists to believe\\nthat their case was hopeful. In their platform of 1872, for example, the\\nRepublicans praised the women for their loyal devotion to freedom,\\nwelcomed them to spheres of wider usefulness, and declared that the\\ndemand of any class of citizens for additional rights deserved\\n\"respectful consideration.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nSUSAN B. ANTHONY]\\n\\nExperience soon demonstrated, however, that praise was not the ballot.\\nIndeed the suffragists already had realized that a tedious contest lay\\nbefore them. They had revived in 1866 their regular national convention.\\nThey gave the name of \"The Revolution\" to their paper, edited by\\nElizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. They formed a national\\nsuffrage association and organized annual pilgrimages to Congress to\\npresent their claims. Such activities bore some results. Many eminent\\ncongressmen were converted to their cause and presented it ably to their\\ncolleagues of both chambers. Still the subject was ridiculed by the\\nnewspapers and looked upon as freakish by the masses.\\n\\n=The State Campaigns.=--Discouraged by the outcome of the national\\ncampaign, suffragists turned to the voters of the individual states and\\nsought the ballot at their hands. Gains by this process were painfully\\nslow. Wyoming, it is true, while still a territory, granted suffrage to\\nwomen in 1869 and continued it on becoming a state twenty years later,\\nin spite of strong protests in Congress. In 1893 Colorado established\\ncomplete political equality. In Utah, the third suffrage state, the\\ncause suffered many vicissitudes. Women were enfranchised by the\\nterritorial legislature; they were deprived of the ballot by Congress in\\n1887; finally in 1896 on the admission of Utah to the union they\\nrecovered their former rights. During the same year, 1896, Idaho\\nconferred equal suffrage upon the women. This was the last suffrage\\nvictory for more than a decade.\\n\\n=The Suffrage Cause in Congress.=--In the midst of the meager gains\\namong the states there were occasional flurries of hope for immediate\\naction on the federal amendment. Between 1878 and 1896 the Senate\\ncommittee reported the suffrage resolution by a favorable majority on\\nfive different occasions. During the same period, however, there were\\nnine unfavorable reports and only once did the subject reach the point\\nof a general debate. At no time could anything like the required\\ntwo-thirds vote be obtained.\\n\\n=The Changing Status of Women.=--While the suffrage movement was\\nlagging, the activities of women in other directions were steadily\\nmultiplying. College after college--Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Smith, Wellesley,\\nto mention a few--was founded to give them the advantages of higher\\neducation. Other institutions, especially the state universities of the\\nWest, opened their doors to women, and women were received into the\\nprofessions of law and medicine. By the rapid growth of public high\\nschools in which girls enjoyed the same rights as boys, education was\\nextended still more widely. The number of women teachers increased by\\nleaps and bounds.\\n\\nMeanwhile women were entering nearly every branch of industry and\\nbusiness. How many of them worked at gainful occupations before 1870 we\\ndo not know; but from that year forward we have the records of the\\ncensus. Between 1870 and 1900 the proportion of women in the professions\\nrose from less than two per cent to more than ten per cent; in trade and\\ntransportation from 24.8 per cent to 43.2 per cent; and in manufacturing\\nfrom 13 to 19 per cent. In 1910, there were over 8,000,000 women\\ngainfully employed as compared with 30,000,000 men. When, during the war\\non Germany, the government established the principle of equal pay for\\nequal work and gave official recognition to the value of their services\\nin industry, it was discovered how far women had traveled along the road\\nforecast by the leaders of 1848.\\n\\n=The Club Movement among Women.=--All over the country women\\'s societies\\nand clubs were started to advance this or that reform or merely to study\\nliterature, art, and science. In time these women\\'s organizations of all\\nkinds were federated into city, state, and national associations and\\ndrawn into the consideration of public questions. Under the leadership\\nof Frances Willard they made temperance reform a vital issue. They took\\nan interest in legislation pertaining to prisons, pure food, public\\nhealth, and municipal government, among other things. At their sessions\\nand conferences local, state, and national issues were discussed until\\nfinally, it seems, everything led to the quest of the franchise. By\\nsolemn resolution in 1914 the National Federation of Women\\'s Clubs,\\nrepresenting nearly two million club women, formally endorsed woman\\nsuffrage. In the same year the National Education Association, speaking\\nfor the public school teachers of the land, added its seal of approval.\\n\\n=State and National Action.=--Again the suffrage movement was in full\\nswing in the states. Washington in 1910, California in 1911, Oregon,\\nKansas, and Arizona in 1912, Nevada and Montana in 1914 by popular vote\\nenfranchised their women. Illinois in 1913 conferred upon them the right\\nto vote for President of the United States. The time had arrived for a\\nnew movement. A number of younger suffragists sought to use the votes of\\nwomen in the equal suffrage states to compel one or both of the national\\npolitical parties to endorse and carry through Congress the federal\\nsuffrage amendment. Pressure then came upon Congress from every\\ndirection: from the suffragists who made a straight appeal on the\\ngrounds of justice; and from the suffragists who besought the women of\\nthe West to vote against candidates for President, who would not approve\\nthe federal amendment. In 1916, for the first time, a leading\\npresidential candidate, Mr. Charles E. Hughes, speaking for the\\nRepublicans, endorsed the federal amendment and a distinguished\\nex-President, Roosevelt, exerted a powerful influence to keep it an\\nissue in the campaign.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nCONFERENCE OF MEN AND WOMEN DELEGATES AT A NATIONAL CONVENTION IN\\n1920]\\n\\n=National Enfranchisement.=--After that, events moved rapidly. The great\\nstate of New York adopted equal suffrage in 1917. Oklahoma, South\\nDakota, and Michigan swung into line the following year; several other\\nstates, by legislative action, gave women the right to vote for\\nPresident. In the meantime the suffrage battle at Washington grew\\nintense. Appeals and petitions poured in upon Congress and the\\nPresident. Militant suffragists held daily demonstrations in Washington.\\nOn September 30, 1918, President Wilson, who, two years before, had\\nopposed federal action and endorsed suffrage by state adoption only,\\nwent before Congress and urged the passage of the suffrage amendment to\\nthe Constitution. In June, 1919, the requisite two-thirds vote was\\nsecured; the resolution was carried and transmitted to the states for\\nratification. On August 28, 1920, the thirty-sixth state, Tennessee,\\napproved the amendment, making three-fourths of the states as required\\nby the Constitution. Thus woman suffrage became the law of the land. A\\nnew political democracy had been created. The age of agitation was\\nclosed and the epoch of responsible citizenship opened.\\n\\n\\n=General References=\\n\\nEdith Abbott, _Women in Industry_.\\n\\nC.P.

The nation had\\ndefinitely passed into industrialism. The number of city dwellers\\nemployed for wages as contrasted with the farmers working on their own\\nland was steadily mounting. The free land, once the refuge of restless\\nworkingmen of the East and the immigrants from Europe, was a thing of\\nthe past. As President Roosevelt later said in speaking of the great\\ncoal strike, \"a few generations ago, the American workman could have\\nsaved money, gone West, and taken up a homestead. Now the free lands\\nwere gone. In earlier days, a man who began with a pick and shovel might\\ncome to own a mine. That outlet was now closed as regards the immense\\nmajority.... The majority of men who earned wages in the coal industry,\\nif they wished to progress at all, were compelled to progress not by\\nceasing to be wage-earners but by improving the conditions under which\\nall the wage-earners of the country lived and worked.\"\\n\\nThe disappearance of the free land, President Roosevelt went on to say,\\nalso produced \"a crass inequality in the bargaining relation of the\\nemployer and the individual employee standing alone. The great\\ncoal-mining and coal-carrying companies which employed their tens of\\nthousands could easily dispense with the services of any particular\\nminer. The miner, on the other hand, however expert, could not dispense\\nwith the companies. He needed a job; his wife and children would starve\\nif he did not get one.... Individually the miners were impotent when\\nthey sought to enter a wage contract with the great companies; they\\ncould make fair terms only by uniting into trade unions to bargain\\ncollectively.\" It was of this state of affairs that President Taft spoke\\nwhen he favored the modification of the common law \"so as to put\\nemployees of little power and means on a level with their employers in\\nadjusting and agreeing upon their mutual obligations.\"\\n\\nJohn D. Rockefeller, Jr., on the side of the great captains of industry,\\nrecognized the same facts. He said: \"In the early days of the\\ndevelopment of industry, the employer and capital investor were\\nfrequently one. Daily contact was had between him and his employees, who\\nwere his friends and neighbors.... Because of the proportions which\\nmodern industry has attained, employers and employees are too often\\nstrangers to each other.... Personal relations can be revived only\\nthrough adequate representation of the employees. Representation is a\\nprinciple which is fundamentally just and vital to the successful\\nconduct of industry.... It is not consistent for us as Americans to\\ndemand democracy in government and practice autocracy in industry....\\nWith the developments what they are in industry to-day, there is sure to\\ncome a progressive evolution from aristocratic single control, whether\\nby capital, labor, or the state, to democratic, cooperative control by\\nall three.\"\\n\\n\\nCOOPERATION BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES\\n\\n=Company Unions.=--The changed economic life described by the three\\neminent men just quoted was acknowledged by several great companies and\\nbusiness concerns. All over the country decided efforts were made to\\nbridge the gulf which industry and the corporation had created. Among\\nthe devices adopted was that of the \"company union.\" In one of the\\nWestern lumber mills, for example, all the employees were invited to\\njoin a company organization; they held monthly meetings to discuss\\nmatters of common concern; they elected a \"shop committee\" to confer\\nwith the representatives of the company; and periodically the agents of\\nthe employers attended the conferences of the men to talk over matters\\nof mutual interest. The function of the shop committee was to consider\\nwages, hours, safety rules, sanitation, recreation and other problems.\\nWhenever any employee had a grievance he took it up with the foreman\\nand, if it was not settled to his satisfaction, he brought it before the\\nshop committee. If the members of the shop committee decided in favor of\\nthe man with a grievance, they attempted to settle the matter with the\\ncompany\\'s agents. All these things failing, the dispute was transferred\\nto a grand meeting of all the employees with the employers\\'\\nrepresentatives, in common council. A deadlock, if it ensued from such a\\nconference, was broken by calling in impartial arbitrators selected by\\nboth sides from among citizens outside the mill. Thus the employees were\\ngiven a voice in all decisions affecting their work and welfare; rights\\nand grievances were treated as matters of mutual interest rather than\\nindividual concern. Representatives of trade unions from outside,\\nhowever, were rigidly excluded from all negotiations between employers\\nand the employees.\\n\\n=Profit-sharing.=--Another proposal for drawing capital and labor\\ntogether was to supplement the wage system by other ties. Sometimes lump\\nsums were paid to employees who remained in a company\\'s service for a\\ndefinite period of years. Again they were given a certain percentage of\\nthe annual profits. In other instances, employees were allowed to buy\\nstock on easy terms and thus become part owners in the concern. This\\nlast plan was carried so far by a large soap manufacturing company that\\nthe employees, besides becoming stockholders, secured the right to elect\\nrepresentatives to serve on the board of directors who managed the\\nentire business. So extensive had profit-sharing become by 1914 that the\\nFederal Industrial Relations Committee, appointed by the President,\\ndeemed it worthy of a special study. Though opposed by regular trade\\nunions, it was undoubtedly growing in popularity.\\n\\n=Labor Managers and Welfare Work.=--Another effort of employers to meet\\nthe problems of the new age appeared in the appointment of specialists,\\nknown as employment managers, whose task it was to study the relations\\nexisting between masters and workers and discover practical methods for\\ndealing with each grievance as it arose. By 1918, hundreds of big\\ncompanies had recognized this modern \"profession\" and universities were\\ngiving courses of instruction on the subject to young men and women. In\\nthat year a national conference of employment managers was held at\\nRochester, New York. The discussion revealed a wide range of duties\\nassigned to managers, including questions of wages, hours, sanitation,\\nrest rooms, recreational facilities, and welfare work of every kind\\ndesigned to make the conditions in mills and factories safer and more\\nhumane. Thus it was evident that hundreds of employers had abandoned the\\nold idea that they were dealing merely with individual employees and\\nthat their obligations ended with the payment of any wages they saw fit\\nto fix. In short, they were seeking to develop a spirit of cooperation\\nto take the place of competition and enmity; and to increase the\\nproduction of commodities by promoting the efficiency and happiness of\\nthe producers.\\n\\n\\nTHE RISE AND GROWTH OF ORGANIZED LABOR\\n\\n=The American Federation of Labor.=--Meanwhile a powerful association of\\nworkers representing all the leading trades and crafts, organized into\\nunions of their own, had been built up outside the control of employers.\\nThis was the American Federation of Labor, a nation-wide union of\\nunions, founded in 1886 on the basis of beginnings made five years\\nbefore. At the time of its establishment it had approximately 150,000\\nmembers. Its growth up to the end of the century was slow, for the total\\nenrollment in 1900 was only 300,000. At that point the increase became\\nmarked. The membership reached 1,650,000 in 1904 and more than 3,000,000\\nin 1919. To be counted in the ranks of organized labor were several\\nstrong unions, friendly to the Federation, though not affiliated with\\nit. Such, for example, were the Railway Brotherhoods with more than half\\na million members. By the opening of 1920 the total strength of\\norganized labor was put at about 4,000,000 members, meaning, if we\\ninclude their families, that nearly one-fifth of the people of the\\nUnited States were in some positive way dependent upon the operations of\\ntrade unions.\\n\\n=Historical Background.=--This was the culmination of a long and\\nsignificant history. Before the end of the eighteenth century, the\\nskilled workmen--printers, shoemakers, tailors, and carpenters--had, as\\nwe have seen, formed local unions in the large cities. Between 1830 and\\n1860, several aggressive steps were taken in the American labor\\nmovement. For one thing, the number of local unions increased by leaps\\nand bounds in all the industrial towns. For another, there was\\nestablished in every large manufacturing city a central labor body\\ncomposed of delegates from the unions of the separate trades. In the\\nlocal union the printers or the cordwainers, for example, considered\\nonly their special trade problems. In the central labor union, printers,\\ncordwainers, iron molders, and other craftsmen considered common\\nproblems and learned to cooperate with one another in enforcing the\\ndemands of each craft. A third step was the federation of the unions of\\nthe same craftsmen in different cities. The printers of New York,\\nPhiladelphia, Boston, and other towns, for instance, drew together and\\nformed a national trade union of printers built upon the local unions of\\nthat craft. By the eve of the Civil War there were four or five powerful\\nnational unions of this character. The expansion of the railway made\\ntravel and correspondence easier and national conventions possible even\\nfor workmen of small means. About 1834 an attempt was made to federate\\nthe unions of all the different crafts into a national organization; but\\nthe effort was premature.\\n\\n_The National Labor Union._--The plan which failed in 1834 was tried\\nagain in the sixties. During the war, industries and railways had\\nflourished as never before; prices had risen rapidly; the demand for\\nlabor had increased; wages had mounted slowly, but steadily. Hundreds of\\nnew local unions had been founded and eight or ten national trade unions\\nhad sprung into being. The time was ripe, it seemed, for a national\\nconsolidation of all labor\\'s forces; and in 1866, the year after the\\nsurrender of General Lee at Appomattox, the \"National Labor Union\" was\\nformed at Baltimore under the leadership of an experienced organizer,\\nW.H. Sylvis of the iron molders. The purpose of the National Labor Union\\nwas not merely to secure labor\\'s standard demands touching hours, wages,\\nand conditions of work or to maintain the gains already won. It leaned\\ntoward political action and radical opinions. Above all, it sought to\\neliminate the conflict between capital and labor by making workingmen\\nthe owners of shops through the formation of cooperative industries. For\\nsix years the National Labor Union continued to hold conferences and\\ncarry on its propaganda; but most of the cooperative enterprises failed,\\npolitical dissensions arose, and by 1872 the experiment had come to an\\nend.\\n\\n_The Knights of Labor._--While the National Labor Union was\\nexperimenting, there grew up in the industrial world a more radical\\norganization known as the \"Noble Order of the Knights of Labor.\" It was\\nfounded in Philadelphia in 1869, first as a secret society with rituals,\\nsigns, and pass words; \"so that no spy of the boss can find his way into\\nthe lodge room to betray his fellows,\" as the Knights put it. In form\\nthe new organization was simple. It sought to bring all laborers,\\nskilled and unskilled, men and women, white and colored, into a mighty\\nbody of local and national unions without distinction of trade or craft.\\nBy 1885, ten years after the national organization was established, it\\nboasted a membership of over 700,000. In philosophy, the Knights of\\nLabor were socialistic, for they advocated public ownership of the\\nrailways and other utilities and the formation of cooperative societies\\nto own and manage stores and factories.\\n\\nAs the Knights were radical in spirit and their strikes, numerous and\\nprolonged, were often accompanied by violence, the organization alarmed\\nemployers and the general public, raising up against itself a vigorous\\nopposition. Weaknesses within, as well as foes from without, started the\\nKnights on the path to dissolution. They waged more strikes than they\\ncould carry on successfully; their cooperative experiments failed as\\nthose of other labor groups before them had failed; and the rank and\\nfile could not be kept in line. The majority of the members wanted\\nimmediate gains in wages or the reduction of hours; when their hopes\\nwere not realized they drifted away from the order. The troubles were\\nincreased by the appearance of the American Federation of Labor, a still\\nmightier organization composed mainly of skilled workers who held\\nstrategic positions in industry. When they failed to secure the\\neffective support of the Federation in their efforts to organize the\\nunskilled, the employers closed in upon them; then the Knights declined\\nrapidly in power. By 1890 they were a negligible factor and in a short\\ntime they passed into the limbo of dead experiments.\\n\\n=The Policies of the American Federation.=--Unlike the Knights of Labor,\\nthe American Federation of Labor sought, first of all, to be very\\npractical in its objects and methods. It avoided all kinds of\\nsocialistic theories and attended strictly to the business of organizing\\nunions for the purpose of increasing wages, shortening hours, and\\nimproving working conditions for its members. It did not try to include\\neverybody in one big union but brought together the employees of each\\nparticular craft whose interests were clearly the same. To prepare for\\nstrikes and periods of unemployment, it raised large funds by imposing\\nheavy dues and created a benefit system to hold men loyally to the\\nunion. In order to permit action on a national scale, it gave the\\nsuperior officers extensive powers over local unions.\\n\\nWhile declaring that employers and employees had much in common, the\\nFederation strongly opposed company unions. Employers, it argued, were\\naffiliated with the National Manufacturers\\' Association or with similar\\nemployers\\' organizations; every important industry was now national in\\nscope; and wages and hours, in view of competition with other shops,\\ncould not be determined in a single factory, no matter how amicable\\nmight be the relations of the company and its workers in that particular\\nplant. For these reasons, the Federation declared company unions and\\nlocal shop committees inherently weak; it insisted that hours, wages,\\nand other labor standards should be fixed by general trade agreements\\napplicable to all the plants of a given industry, even if subject to\\nlocal modifications.\\n\\nAt the same time, the Federation, far from deliberately antagonizing\\nemployers, sought to enlist their cooperation and support. It affiliated\\nwith the National Civic Federation, an association of business men,\\nfinanciers, and professional men, founded in 1900 to promote friendly\\nrelations in the industrial world. In brief, the American Federation of\\nLabor accepted the modern industrial system and, by organization within\\nit, endeavored to secure certain definite terms and conditions for trade\\nunionists.\\n\\n\\nTHE WIDER RELATIONS OF ORGANIZED LABOR\\n\\n=The Socialists.=--The trade unionism \"pure and simple,\" espoused by the\\nAmerican Federation of Labor, seemed to involve at first glance nothing\\nbut businesslike negotiations with employers. In practice it did not\\nwork out that way. The Federation was only six years old when a new\\norganization, appealing directly for the labor vote--namely, the\\nSocialist Labor Party--nominated a candidate for President, launched\\ninto a national campaign, and called upon trade unionists to desert the\\nolder parties and enter its fold.\\n\\nThe socialistic idea, introduced into national politics in 1892, had\\nbeen long in germination. Before the Civil War, a number of reformers,\\nincluding Nathaniel Hawthorne, Horace Greeley, and Wendell Phillips,\\ndeeply moved by the poverty of the great industrial cities, had\\nearnestly sought relief in the establishment of cooperative or\\ncommunistic colonies. They believed that people should go into the\\ncountry, secure land and tools, own them in common so that no one could\\nprofit from exclusive ownership, and produce by common labor the food\\nand clothing necessary for their support. For a time this movement\\nattracted wide interest, but it had little vitality. Nearly all the\\ncolonies failed. Selfishness and indolence usually disrupted the best of\\nthem.\\n\\nIn the course of time this \"Utopian\" idea was abandoned, and another set\\nof socialist doctrines, claiming to be more \"scientific,\" appeared\\ninstead. The new school of socialists, adopting the principles of a\\nGerman writer and agitator, Karl Marx, appealed directly to workingmen.\\nIt urged them to unite against the capitalists, to get possession of the\\nmachinery of government, and to introduce collective or public ownership\\nof railways, land, mines, mills, and other means of production. The\\nMarxian socialists, therefore, became political. They sought to organize\\nlabor and to win elections. Like the other parties they put forward\\ncandidates and platforms. The Socialist Labor party in 1892, for\\nexample, declared in favor of government ownership of utilities, free\\nschool books, woman suffrage, heavy income taxes, and the referendum.\\nThe Socialist party, founded in 1900, with Eugene V. Debs, the leader of\\nthe Pullman strike, as its candidate, called for public ownership of all\\ntrusts, monopolies, mines, railways; and the chief means of production.\\nIn the course of time the vote of the latter organization rose to\\nconsiderable proportions, reaching almost a million in 1912. It declined\\nfour years later and then rose in 1920 to about the same figure.\\n\\nIn their appeal for votes, the socialists of every type turned first to\\nlabor. At the annual conventions of the American Federation of Labor\\nthey besought the delegates to endorse socialism. The president of the\\nFederation, Samuel Gompers, on each occasion took the floor against\\nthem. He repudiated socialism and the socialists, on both theoretical\\nand practical grounds. He opposed too much public ownership, declaring\\nthat the government was as likely as any private employer to oppress\\nlabor. The approval of socialism, he maintained, would split the\\nFederation on the rock of politics, weaken it in its fight for higher\\nwages and shorter hours, and prejudice the public against it. At every\\nturn he was able to vanquish the socialists in the Federation, although\\nhe could not prevent it from endorsing public ownership of the railways\\nat the convention of 1920.\\n\\n=The Extreme Radicals.=--Some of the socialists, defeated in their\\nefforts to capture organized labor and seeing that the gains in\\nelections were very meager, broke away from both trade unionism and\\npolitics. One faction, the Industrial Workers of the World, founded in\\n1905, declared themselves opposed to all capitalists, the wages system,\\nand craft unions. They asserted that the \"working class and the\\nemploying class have nothing in common\" and that trade unions only\\npitted one set of workers against another set. They repudiated all\\ngovernment ownership and the government itself, boldly proclaiming their\\nintention to unite all employees into one big union and seize the\\nrailways, mines, and mills of the country. This doctrine, so\\nrevolutionary in tone, called down upon the extremists the condemnation\\nof the American Federation of Labor as well as of the general public. At\\nits convention in 1919, the Federation went on record as \"opposed to\\nBolshevism, I.W.W.-ism, and the irresponsible leadership that encourages\\nsuch a policy.\" It announced its \"firm adherence to American ideals.\"\\n\\n=The Federation and Political Issues.=--The hostility of the Federation\\nto the socialists did not mean, however, that it was indifferent to\\npolitical issues or political parties. On the contrary, from time to\\ntime, at its annual conventions, it endorsed political and social\\nreforms, such as the initiative, referendum, and recall, the abolition\\nof child labor, the exclusion of Oriental labor, old-age pensions, and\\ngovernment ownership. Moreover it adopted the policy of \"rewarding\\nfriends and punishing enemies\" by advising members to vote for or\\nagainst candidates according to their stand on the demands of organized\\nlabor.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nSAMUEL GOMPERS AND OTHER LABOR LEADERS]\\n\\nThis policy was pursued with especial zeal in connection with disputes\\nover the use of injunctions in labor controversies. An injunction is a\\nbill or writ issued by a judge ordering some person or corporation to do\\nor to refrain from doing something. For example, a judge may order a\\ntrade union to refrain from interfering with non-union men or to\\ncontinue at work handling goods made by non-union labor; and he may fine\\nor imprison those who disobey his injunction, the penalty being\\ninflicted for \"contempt of court.\" This ancient legal device came into\\nprominence in connection with nation-wide railway strikes in 1877. It\\nwas applied with increasing frequency after its effective use against\\nEugene V. Debs in the Pullman strike of 1894.\\n\\nAroused by the extensive use of the writ, organized labor demanded that\\nthe power of judges to issue injunctions in labor disputes be limited by\\nlaw. Representatives of the unions sought support from the Democrats and\\nthe Republicans; they received from the former very specific and cordial\\nendorsement. In 1896 the Democratic platform denounced \"government by\\ninjunction as a new and highly dangerous form of oppression.\" Mr.\\nGompers, while refusing to commit the Federation to Democratic politics,\\nprivately supported Mr. Bryan. In 1908, he came out openly and boasted\\nthat eighty per cent of the votes of the Federation had been cast for\\nthe Democratic candidate. Again in 1912 the same policy was pursued. The\\nreward was the enactment in 1914 of a federal law exempting trade unions\\nfrom prosecution as combinations in restraint of trade, limiting the use\\nof the injunction in labor disputes, and prescribing trial by jury in\\ncase of contempt of court. This measure was hailed by Mr. Gompers as the\\n\"Magna Carta of Labor\" and a vindication of his policy. As a matter of\\nfact, however, it did not prevent the continued use of injunctions\\nagainst trade unions. Nevertheless Mr. Gompers was unshaken in his\\nconviction that organized labor should not attempt to form an\\nindependent political party or endorse socialist or other radical\\neconomic theories.\\n\\n=Organized Labor and the Public.=--Besides its relations to employers,\\nradicals within its own ranks, and political questions, the Federation\\nhad to face responsibilities to the general public. With the passing of\\ntime these became heavy and grave. While industries were small and\\nconflicts were local in character, a strike seldom affected anybody but\\nthe employer and the employees immediately involved in it. When,\\nhowever, industries and trade unions became organized on a national\\nscale and a strike could paralyze a basic enterprise like coal mining or\\nrailways, the vital interests of all citizens were put in jeopardy.\\nMoreover, as increases in wages and reductions in hours often added\\ndirectly to the cost of living, the action of the unions affected the\\nwell-being of all--the food, clothing, and shelter of the whole people.\\n\\nFor the purpose of meeting the issue raised by this state of affairs, it\\nwas suggested that employers and employees should lay their disputes\\nbefore commissions of arbitration for decision and settlement. President\\nCleveland, in a message of April 2, 1886, proposed such a method for\\ndisposing of industrial controversies, and two years later Congress\\nenacted a voluntary arbitration law applicable to the railways. The\\nprinciple was extended in 1898 and again in 1913, and under the\\nauthority of the federal government many contentions in the railway\\nworld were settled by arbitration.\\n\\nThe success of such legislation induced some students of industrial\\nquestions to urge that unions and employers should be compelled to\\nsubmit all disputes to official tribunals of arbitration. Kansas\\nactually passed such a law in 1920. Congress in the Esch-Cummins railway\\nbill of the same year created a federal board of nine members to which\\nall railway controversies, not settled by negotiation, must be\\nsubmitted. Strikes, however, were not absolutely forbidden. Generally\\nspeaking, both employers and employees opposed compulsory adjustments\\nwithout offering any substitute in case voluntary arbitration should not\\nbe accepted by both parties to a dispute.\\n\\n\\nIMMIGRATION AND AMERICANIZATION\\n\\n=The Problems of Immigration.=--From its very inception, the American\\nFederation of Labor, like the Knights of Labor before it, was confronted\\nby numerous questions raised by the ever swelling tide of aliens coming\\nto our shores. In its effort to make each trade union all-inclusive, it\\nhad to wrestle with a score or more languages. When it succeeded in\\nthoroughly organizing a craft, it often found its purposes defeated by\\nan influx of foreigners ready to work for lower wages and thus undermine\\nthe foundations of the union.\\n\\nAt the same time, persons outside the labor movement began to be\\napprehensive as they contemplated the undoubted evil, as well as the\\ngood, that seemed to be associated with the \"alien invasion.\" They saw\\nwhole sections of great cities occupied by people speaking foreign\\ntongues, reading only foreign newspapers, and looking to the Old World\\nalone for their ideas and their customs. They witnessed an expanding\\narmy of total illiterates, men and women who could read and write no\\nlanguage at all; while among those aliens who could read few there were\\nwho knew anything of American history, traditions, and ideals. Official\\nreports revealed that over twenty per cent of the men of the draft army\\nduring the World War could not read a newspaper or write a letter home.\\nPerhaps most alarming of all was the discovery that thousands of alien\\nmen are in the United States only on a temporary sojourn, solely to make\\nmoney and return home with their savings. These men, willing to work for\\nlow wages and live in places unfit for human beings, have no stake in\\nthis country and do not care what becomes of it.\\n\\n=The Restriction of Immigration.=--In all this there was, strictly\\nspeaking, no cause for surprise. Since the foundation of our republic\\nthe policy of the government had been to encourage the coming of the\\nalien. For nearly one hundred years no restraining act was passed by\\nCongress, while two important laws positively encouraged it; namely, the\\nhomestead act of 1862 and the contract immigration law of 1864. Not\\nuntil American workingmen came into open collision with cheap Chinese\\nlabor on the Pacific Coast did the federal government spread the first\\nmeasure of limitation on the statute books. After the discovery of gold,\\nand particularly after the opening of the railway construction era, a\\nhorde of laborers from China descended upon California. Accustomed to\\nstarvation wages and indifferent to the conditions of living, they\\nthreatened to cut the American standard to the point of subsistence. By\\n1876 the protest of American labor was loud and long and both the\\nRepublicans and the Democrats gave heed to it. In 1882 Congress enacted\\na law prohibiting the admission of Chinese laborers to the United States\\nfor a term of ten years--later extended by legislation. In a little\\nwhile the demand arose for the exclusion of the Japanese as well. In\\nthis case no exclusion law was passed; but an understanding was reached\\nby which Japan agreed not to issue passports to her laborers authorizing\\nthem to come to the United States. By act of Congress in 1907 the\\nPresident was empowered to exclude any laborers who, having passports to\\nCanada, Hawaii, or Mexico, attempted to enter our country.\\n\\nThese laws and agreements, however, did not remove all grounds for the\\nagitation of the subject. They were difficult to enforce and it was\\nclaimed by residents of the Coast that in spite of federal authority\\nOriental laborers were finding their way into American ports. Moreover,\\nseveral Western states, anxious to preserve the soil for American\\nownership, enacted laws making it impossible for Chinese and Japanese to\\nbuy land outright; and in other ways they discriminated against\\nOrientals. Such proceedings placed the federal government in an\\nembarrassing position. By treaty it had guaranteed specific rights to\\nJapanese citizens in the United States, and the government at Tokyo\\ncontended that the state laws just cited violated the terms of the\\ninternational agreement. The Western states were fixed in their\\ndetermination to control Oriental residents; Japan was equally\\npersistent in asking that no badge of inferiority be attached to her\\ncitizens. Subjected to pressure on both sides, the federal government\\nsought a way out of the deadlock.\\n\\nHaving embarked upon the policy of restriction in 1882, Congress readily\\nextended it. In that same year it barred paupers, criminals, convicts,\\nand the insane. Three years later, mainly owing to the pressure of the\\nKnights of Labor, it forbade any person, company, or association to\\nimport aliens under contract. By an act of 1887, the contract labor\\nrestriction was made even more severe. In 1903, anarchists were excluded\\nand the bureau of immigration was transferred from the Treasury\\nDepartment to the Department of Commerce and Labor, in order to provide\\nfor a more rigid execution of the law. In 1907 the classes of persons\\ndenied admission were widened to embrace those suffering from physical\\nand mental defects and otherwise unfit for effective citizenship. When\\nthe Department of Labor was established in 1913 the enforcement of the\\nlaw was placed in the hands of the Secretary of Labor, W.B. Wilson, who\\nwas a former leader in the American Federation of Labor.\\n\\n=The Literacy Test.=--Still the advocates of restriction were not\\nsatisfied. Still organized labor protested and demanded more protection\\nagainst the competition of immigrants. In 1917 it won a thirty-year\\nbattle in the passage of a bill excluding \"all aliens over sixteen years\\nof age, physically capable of reading, who cannot read the English\\nlanguage or some other language or dialect, including Hebrew or\\nYiddish.\" Even President Wilson could not block it, for a two-thirds\\nvote to overcome his veto was mustered in Congress.\\n\\nThis act, while it served to exclude illiterates, made no drastic cut in\\nthe volume of immigration. Indeed a material reduction was resolutely\\nopposed in many quarters. People of certain nationalities already in the\\nUnited States objected to every barrier that shut out their own kinsmen.\\nSome Americans of the old stock still held to the idea that the United\\nStates should continue to be an asylum for \"the oppressed of the earth.\"\\nMany employers looked upon an increased labor supply as the means of\\nescaping what they called \"the domination of trade unions.\" In the babel\\nof countless voices, the discussion of these vital matters went on in\\ntown and country.\\n\\n=Americanization.=--Intimately connected with the subject of immigration\\nwas a call for the \"Americanization\" of the alien already within our\\ngates. The revelation of the illiteracy in the army raised the cry and\\nthe demand was intensified when it was found that many of the leaders\\namong the extreme radicals were foreign in birth and citizenship.\\nInnumerable programs for assimilating the alien to American life were\\ndrawn up, and in 1919 a national conference on the subject was held in\\nWashington under the auspices of the Department of the Interior. All\\nwere agreed that the foreigner should be taught to speak and write the\\nlanguage and understand the government of our country. Congress was\\nurged to lend aid in this vast undertaking. America, as ex-President\\nRoosevelt had said, was to find out \"whether it was a nation or a\\nboarding-house.\"\\n\\n\\n=General References=\\n\\nJ.R.

In this spirit, as President,\\nhe gave the signal for work by summoning Congress in a special session\\non April 7, 1913. He invited the cooperation of all \"forward-looking\\nmen\" and indicated that he would assume the role of leadership. As an\\nevidence of his resolve, he appeared before Congress in person to read\\nhis first message, reviving the old custom of Washington and Adams. Then\\nhe let it be known that he would not give his party any rest until it\\nfulfilled its pledges to the country. When Democratic Senators balked at\\ntariff reductions, they were sharply informed that the party had\\nplighted its word and that no excuses or delays would be tolerated.\\n\\n\\nDOMESTIC LEGISLATION\\n\\n=Financial Measures.=--Under this spirited leadership Congress went to\\nwork, passing first the Underwood tariff act of 1913, which made a\\ndownward revision in the rates of duty, fixing them on the average about\\ntwenty-six per cent lower than the figures of 1907. The protective\\nprinciple was retained, but an effort was made to permit a moderate\\nelement of foreign competition. As a part of the revenue act Congress\\nlevied a tax on incomes as authorized by the sixteenth amendment to the\\nConstitution. The tax which roused such party passions twenty years\\nbefore was now accepted as a matter of course.\\n\\nHaving disposed of the tariff, Congress took up the old and vexatious\\ncurrency question and offered a new solution in the form of the federal\\nreserve law of December, 1913. This measure, one of the most interesting\\nin the history of federal finance, embraced four leading features. In\\nthe first place, it continued the prohibition on the issuance of notes\\nby state banks and provided for a national currency. In the second\\nplace, it put the new banking system under the control of a federal\\nreserve board composed entirely of government officials. To prevent the\\ngrowth of a \"central money power,\" it provided, in the third place, for\\nthe creation of twelve federal reserve banks, one in each of twelve\\ngreat districts into which the country is divided. All local national\\nbanks were required and certain other banks permitted to become members\\nof the new system and share in its control. Finally, with a view to\\nexpanding the currency, a step which the Democrats had long urged upon\\nthe country, the issuance of paper money, under definite safeguards, was\\nauthorized.\\n\\nMindful of the agricultural interest, ever dear to the heart of\\nJefferson\\'s followers, the Democrats supplemented the reserve law by the\\nFarm Loan Act of 1916, creating federal agencies to lend money on farm\\nmortgages at moderate rates of interest. Within a year $20,000,000 had\\nbeen lent to farmers, the heaviest borrowing being in nine Western and\\nSouthern states, with Texas in the lead.\\n\\n=Anti-trust Legislation.=--The tariff and currency laws were followed by\\nthree significant measures relative to trusts. Rejecting utterly the\\nProgressive doctrine of government regulation, President Wilson\\nannounced that it was the purpose of the Democrats \"to destroy monopoly\\nand maintain competition as the only effective instrument of business\\nliberty.\" The first step in this direction, the Clayton Anti-trust Act,\\ncarried into great detail the Sherman law of 1890 forbidding and\\npenalizing combinations in restraint of interstate and foreign trade. In\\nevery line it revealed a determined effort to tear apart the great\\ntrusts and to put all business on a competitive basis. Its terms were\\nreinforced in the same year by a law creating a Federal Trade Commission\\nempowered to inquire into the methods of corporations and lodge\\ncomplaints against concerns \"using any unfair method of competition.\" In\\nonly one respect was the severity of the Democratic policy relaxed. An\\nact of 1918 provided that the Sherman law should not apply to companies\\nengaged in export trade, the purpose being to encourage large\\ncorporations to enter foreign commerce.\\n\\nThe effect of this whole body of anti-trust legislation, in spite of\\nmuch labor on it, remained problematical. Very few combinations were\\ndissolved as a result of it. Startling investigations were made into\\nalleged abuses on the part of trusts; but it could hardly be said that\\nhuge business concerns had lost any of their predominance in American\\nindustry.\\n\\n=Labor Legislation.=--By no mere coincidence, the Clayton Anti-trust law\\nof 1914 made many concessions to organized labor. It declared that \"the\\nlabor of a human being is not a commodity or an article of commerce,\"\\nand it exempted unions from prosecution as \"combinations in restraint of\\ntrade.\" It likewise defined and limited the uses which the federal\\ncourts might make of injunctions in labor disputes and guaranteed trial\\nby jury to those guilty of disobedience (see p. 581).\\n\\nThe Clayton law was followed the next year by the Seamen\\'s Act giving\\ngreater liberty of contract to American sailors and requiring an\\nimprovement of living conditions on shipboard. This was such a drastic\\nlaw that shipowners declared themselves unable to meet foreign\\ncompetition under its terms, owing to the low labor standards of other\\ncountries.\\n\\nStill more extraordinary than the Seamen\\'s Act was the Adamson law of\\n1916 fixing a standard eight-hour work-day for trainmen on railroads--a\\nmeasure wrung from Congress under a threat of a great strike by the four\\nRailway Brotherhoods. This act, viewed by union leaders as a triumph,\\ncalled forth a bitter denunciation of \"trade union domination,\" but it\\nwas easier to criticize than to find another solution of the problem.\\n\\nThree other laws enacted during President Wilson\\'s administration were\\npopular in the labor world. One of them provided compensation for\\nfederal employees injured in the discharge of their duties. Another\\nprohibited the labor of children under a certain age in the industries\\nof the nation. A third prescribed for coal miners in Alaska an\\neight-hour day and modern safeguards for life and health. There were\\npositive proofs that organized labor had obtained a large share of power\\nin the councils of the country.\\n\\n=Federal and State Relations.=--If the interference of the government\\nwith business and labor represented a departure from the old idea of\\n\"the less government the better,\" what can be said of a large body of\\nlaws affecting the rights of states? The prohibition of child labor\\neverywhere was one indication of the new tendency. Mr. Wilson had once\\ndeclared such legislation unconstitutional; the Supreme Court declared\\nit unconstitutional; but Congress, undaunted, carried it into effect\\nunder the guise of a tax on goods made by children below the age limit.\\nThere were other indications of the drift. Large sums of money were\\nappropriated by Congress in 1916 to assist the states in building and\\nmaintaining highways. The same year the Farm Loan Act projected the\\nfederal government into the sphere of local money lending. In 1917\\nmillions of dollars were granted to states in aid of vocational\\neducation, incidentally imposing uniform standards throughout the\\ncountry. Evidently the government was no longer limited to the duties of\\nthe policeman.\\n\\n=The Prohibition Amendment.=--A still more significant form of\\nintervention in state affairs was the passage, in December, 1917, of an\\namendment to the federal Constitution establishing national prohibition\\nof the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors as beverages. This\\nwas the climax of a historical movement extending over half a century.\\nIn 1872, a National Prohibition party, launched three years before,\\nnominated its first presidential candidate and inaugurated a campaign of\\nagitation. Though its vote was never large, the cause for which it\\nstood found increasing favor among the people. State after state by\\npopular referendum abolished the liquor traffic within its borders. By\\n1917 at least thirty-two of the forty-eight were \"dry.\" When the federal\\namendment was submitted for approval, the ratification was surprisingly\\nswift. In a little more than a year, namely, on January 16, 1919, it was\\nproclaimed. Twelve months later the amendment went into effect.\\n\\n\\nCOLONIAL AND FOREIGN POLICIES\\n\\n=The Philippines and Porto Rico.=--Independence for the Philippines and\\nlarger self-government for Porto Rico had been among the policies of the\\nDemocratic party since the campaign of 1900. President Wilson in his\\nannual messages urged upon Congress more autonomy for the Filipinos and\\na definite promise of final independence. The result was the Jones\\nOrganic Act for the Philippines passed in 1916. This measure provided\\nthat the upper as well as the lower house of the Philippine legislature\\nshould be elected by popular vote, and declared it to be the intention\\nof the United States to grant independence \"as soon as a stable\\ngovernment can be established.\" This, said President Wilson on signing\\nthe bill, is \"a very satisfactory advance in our policy of extending to\\nthem self-government and control of their own affairs.\" The following\\nyear Congress, yielding to President Wilson\\'s insistence, passed a new\\n\\norganic act for Porto Rico, making both houses of the legislature\\nelective and conferring American citizenship upon the inhabitants of the\\nisland.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE CARIBBEAN REGION]\\n\\n=American Power in the Caribbean.=--While extending more self-government\\nto its dominions, the United States enlarged its sphere of influence in\\nthe Caribbean. The supervision of finances in Santo Domingo, inaugurated\\nin Roosevelt\\'s administration, was transformed into a protectorate under\\nWilson. In 1914 dissensions in the republic led to the landing of\\nAmerican marines to \"supervise\" the elections. Two years later, an\\nofficer in the American navy, with authority from Washington, placed\\nthe entire republic \"in a state of military occupation.\" He proceeded to\\nsuspend the government and laws of the country, exile the president,\\nsuppress the congress, and substitute American military authority. In\\n1919 a consulting board of four prominent Dominicans was appointed to\\naid the American military governor; but it resigned the next year after\\nmaking a plea for the restoration of independence to the republic. For\\nall practical purposes, it seemed, the sovereignty of Santo Domingo had\\nbeen transferred to the United States.\\n\\nIn the neighboring republic of Haiti, a similar state of affairs\\nexisted. In the summer of 1915 a revolution broke out there--one of a\\nlong series beginning in 1804--and our marines were landed to restore\\norder. Elections were held under the supervision of American officers,\\nand a treaty was drawn up placing the management of Haitian finances and\\nthe local constabulary under American authority. In taking this action,\\nour Secretary of State was careful to announce: \"The United States\\ngovernment has no purpose of aggression and is entirely disinterested in\\npromoting this protectorate.\" Still it must be said that there were\\nvigorous protests on the part of natives and American citizens against\\nthe conduct of our agents in the island. In 1921 President Wilson was\\nconsidering withdrawal.\\n\\nIn line with American policy in the West Indian waters was the purchase\\nin 1917 of the Danish Islands just off the coast of Porto Rico. The\\nstrategic position of the islands, especially in relation to Haiti and\\nPorto Rico, made them an object of American concern as early as 1867,\\nwhen a treaty of purchase was negotiated only to be rejected by the\\nSenate of the United States. In 1902 a second arrangement was made, but\\nthis time it was defeated by the upper house of the Danish parliament.\\nThe third treaty brought an end to fifty years of bargaining and the\\nStars and Stripes were raised over St. Croix, St. Thomas, St. John, and\\nnumerous minor islands scattered about in the neighborhood. \"It would be\\nsuicidal,\" commented a New York newspaper, \"for America, on the\\nthreshold of a great commercial expansion in South America, to suffer a\\nHeligoland, or a Gibraltar, or an Aden to be erected by her rivals at\\nthe mouth of her Suez.\" On the mainland American power was strengthened\\nby the establishment of a protectorate over Nicaragua in 1916.\\n\\n=Mexican Relations.=--The extension of American enterprise southward\\ninto Latin America, of which the operations in the Caribbean regions\\nwere merely one phase, naturally carried Americans into Mexico to\\ndevelop the natural resources of that country. Under the iron rule of\\nGeneral Porfirio Diaz, established in 1876 and maintained with only a\\nshort break until 1911, Mexico had become increasingly attractive to our\\nbusiness men. On the invitation of President Diaz, they had invested\\nhuge sums in Mexican lands, oil fields, and mines, and had laid the\\nfoundations of a new industrial order. The severe regime instituted by\\nDiaz, however, stirred popular discontent. The peons, or serfs, demanded\\nthe break-up of the great estates, some of which had come down from the\\ndays of Cortez. Their clamor for \"the restoration of the land to the\\npeople could not be silenced.\" In 1911 Diaz was forced to resign and\\nleft the country.\\n\\nMexico now slid down the path to disorder. Revolutions and civil\\ncommotions followed in swift succession. A liberal president, Madero,\\ninstalled as the successor to Diaz, was deposed in 1913 and brutally\\nmurdered. Huerta, a military adventurer, hailed for a time as another\\n\"strong man,\" succeeded Madero whose murder he was accused of\\ninstigating. Although Great Britain and nearly all the powers of Europe\\naccepted the new government as lawful, the United States steadily\\nwithheld recognition. In the meantime Mexico was torn by insurrections\\nunder the leadership of Carranza, a friend of Madero, Villa, a bandit of\\ngenerous pretensions, and Zapata, a radical leader of the peons. Without\\nthe support of the United States, Huerta was doomed.\\n\\nIn the summer of 1914, the dictator resigned and fled from the capital,\\nleaving the field to Carranza. For six years the new president,\\nrecognized by the United States, held a precarious position which he\\nvigorously strove to strengthen against various revolutionary movements.\\nAt length in 1920, he too was deposed and murdered, and another military\\nchieftain, Obregon, installed in power.\\n\\nThese events right at our door could not fail to involve the government\\nof the United States. In the disorders many American citizens lost their\\nlives. American property was destroyed and land owned by Americans was\\nconfiscated. A new Mexican constitution, in effect nationalizing the\\nnatural resources of the country, struck at the rights of foreign\\ninvestors. Moreover the Mexican border was in constant turmoil. Even in\\nthe last days of his administration, Mr. Taft felt compelled to issue a\\nsolemn warning to the Mexican government protesting against the\\nviolation of American rights.\\n\\nPresident Wilson, soon after his inauguration, sent a commissioner to\\nMexico to inquire into the situation. Although he declared a general\\npolicy of \"watchful waiting,\" he twice came to blows with Mexican\\nforces. In 1914 some American sailors at Tampico were arrested by a\\nMexican officer; the Mexican government, although it immediately\\nreleased the men, refused to make the required apology for the incident.\\nAs a result President Wilson ordered the landing of American forces at\\nVera Cruz and the occupation of the city. A clash of arms followed in\\nwhich several Americans were killed. War seemed inevitable, but at this\\njuncture the governments of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile tendered their\\ngood offices as mediators. After a few weeks of negotiation, during\\nwhich Huerta was forced out of power, American forces were withdrawn\\nfrom Vera Cruz and the incident closed.\\n\\nIn 1916 a second break in amicable relations occurred. In the spring of\\nthat year a band of Villa\\'s men raided the town of Columbus, New Mexico,\\nkilling several citizens and committing robberies. A punitive expedition\\nunder the command of General Pershing was quickly sent out to capture\\nthe offenders. Against the protests of President Carranza, American\\nforces penetrated deeply into Mexico without effecting the object of\\nthe undertaking. This operation lasted until January, 1917, when the\\nimminence of war with Germany led to the withdrawal of the American\\nsoldiers. Friendly relations were resumed with the Mexican government\\nand the policy of \"watchful waiting\" was continued.\\n\\n\\nTHE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN WAR\\n\\n=The Outbreak of the War.=--In the opening days of August, 1914, the\\nage-long jealousies of European nations, sharpened by new imperial\\nambitions, broke out in another general conflict such as had shaken the\\nworld in the days of Napoleon. On June 28, the heir to the\\nAustro-Hungarian throne was assassinated at Serajevo, the capital of\\nBosnia, an Austrian province occupied mainly by Serbs. With a view to\\nstopping Serbian agitation for independence, Austria-Hungary laid the\\nblame for this incident on the government of Serbia and made humiliating\\ndemands on that country. Germany at once proposed that the issue should\\nbe regarded as \"an affair which should be settled solely between\\nAustria-Hungary and Serbia\"; meaning that the small nation should be\\nleft to the tender mercies of a great power. Russia refused to take this\\nview. Great Britain proposed a settlement by mediation. Germany backed\\nup Austria to the limit. To use the language of the German authorities:\\n\"We were perfectly aware that a possible warlike attitude of\\nAustria-Hungary against Serbia might bring Russia upon the field and\\nthat it might therefore involve us in a war, in accordance with our\\nduties as allies. We could not, however, in these vital interests of\\nAustria-Hungary which were at stake, advise our ally to take a yielding\\nattitude not compatible with his dignity nor deny him our assistance.\"\\nThat made the war inevitable.\\n\\nEvery day of the fateful August, 1914, was crowded with momentous\\nevents. On the 1st, Germany declared war on Russia. On the 2d, the\\nGermans invaded the little duchy of Luxemburg and notified the King of\\nBelgium that they were preparing to violate the neutrality of his realm\\non their way to Paris. On the same day, Great Britain, anxiously\\nbesought by the French government, promised the aid of the British navy\\nif German warships made hostile demonstrations in the Channel. August\\n3d, the German government declared war on France. The following day,\\nGreat Britain demanded of Germany respect for Belgian neutrality and,\\nfailing to receive the guarantee, broke off diplomatic relations. On the\\n5th, the British prime minister announced that war had opened between\\nEngland and Germany. The storm now broke in all its pitiless fury.\\n\\n=The State of American Opinion.=--Although President Wilson promptly\\nproclaimed the neutrality of the United States, the sympathies of a\\nlarge majority of the American people were without doubt on the side of\\nGreat Britain and France. To them the invasion of the little kingdom of\\nBelgium and the horrors that accompanied German occupation were odious\\nin the extreme. Moreover, they regarded the German imperial government\\nas an autocratic power wielded in the interest of an ambitious military\\nparty. The Kaiser, William II, and the Crown Prince were the symbols of\\nroyal arrogance. On the other hand, many Americans of German descent, in\\nmemory of their ties with the Fatherland, openly sympathized with the\\nCentral Powers; and many Americans of Irish descent, recalling their\\nlong and bitter struggle for home rule in Ireland, would have regarded\\nBritish defeat as a merited redress of ancient grievances.\\n\\nExtremely sensitive to American opinion, but ill informed about it, the\\nGerman government soon began systematic efforts to present its cause to\\nthe people of the United States in the most favorable light possible.\\nDr. Bernhard Dernburg, the former colonial secretary of the German\\nempire, was sent to America as a special agent. For months he filled the\\nnewspapers, magazines, and periodicals with interviews, articles, and\\nnotes on the justice of the Teutonic cause. From a press bureau in New\\nYork flowed a stream of pamphlets, leaflets, and cartoons. A magazine,\\n\"The Fatherland,\" was founded to secure \"fair play for Germany and\\nAustria.\" Several professors in American universities, who had received\\ntheir training in Germany, took up the pen in defense of the Central\\nEmpires. The German language press, without exception it seems, the\\nNational German Alliance, minor German societies, and Lutheran churches\\ncame to the support of the German cause. Even the English language\\npapers, though generally favorable to the Entente Allies, opened their\\ncolumns in the interest of equal justice to the spokesmen for all the\\ncontending powers of Europe.\\n\\nBefore two weeks had elapsed the controversy had become so intense that\\nPresident Wilson (August 18, 1914) was moved to caution his countrymen\\nagainst falling into angry disputes. \"Every man,\" he said, \"who really\\nloves America will act and speak in the true spirit of neutrality which\\nis the spirit of impartiality and fairness and friendliness to all\\nconcerned.... We must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must\\nput a curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that\\nmight be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle before\\nanother.\"\\n\\n=The Clash over American Trade.=--As in the time of the Napoleonic wars,\\nthe conflict in Europe raised fundamental questions respecting rights of\\nAmericans trading with countries at peace as well as those at war. On\\nthis point there existed on August 1, 1914, a fairly definite body of\\nprinciples by which nations were bound. Among them the following were of\\nvital significance. In the first place, it was recognized that an enemy\\nmerchant ship caught on the high seas was a legitimate prize of war\\nwhich might be seized and confiscated. In the second place, it was\\nagreed that \"contraband of war\" found on an enemy or neutral ship was a\\nlawful prize; any ship suspected of carrying it was liable to search and\\nif caught with forbidden goods was subject to seizure. In the third\\nplace, international law prescribed that a peaceful merchant ship,\\nwhether belonging to an enemy or to a neutral country, should not be\\ndestroyed or sunk without provision for the safety of crew and\\npassengers. In the fourth place, it was understood that a belligerent\\nhad the right, if it could, to blockade the ports of an enemy and\\nprevent the ingress and egress of all ships; but such a blockade, to be\\nlawful, had to be effective.\\n\\nThese general principles left undetermined two important matters: \"What\\nis an effective blockade?\" and \"What is contraband of war?\" The task of\\nanswering these questions fell to Great Britain as mistress of the seas.\\nAlthough the German submarines made it impossible for her battleships to\\nmaintain a continuous patrol of the waters in front of blockaded ports,\\n\\nshe declared the blockade to be none the less \"effective\" because her\\nnavy was supreme. As to contraband of war Great Britain put such a broad\\ninterpretation upon the term as to include nearly every important\\narticle of commerce. Early in 1915 she declared even cargoes of grain\\nand flour to be contraband, defending the action on the ground that the\\nGerman government had recently taken possession of all domestic stocks\\nof corn, wheat, and flour.\\n\\nA new question arose in connection with American trade with the neutral\\ncountries surrounding Germany. Great Britain early began to intercept\\nships carrying oil, gasoline, and copper--all war materials of prime\\nimportance--on the ground that they either were destined ultimately to\\nGermany or would release goods for sale to Germans. On November 2, 1914,\\nthe English government announced that the Germans wore sowing mines in\\nopen waters and that therefore the whole of the North Sea was a military\\nzone. Ships bound for Denmark, Norway, and Sweden were ordered to come\\nby the English Channel for inspection and sailing directions. In effect,\\nAmericans were now licensed by Great Britain to trade in certain\\ncommodities and in certain amounts with neutral countries.\\n\\nAgainst these extraordinary measures, the State Department at Washington\\nlodged pointed objections, saying: \"This government is reluctantly\\nforced to the conclusion that the present policy of His Majesty\\'s\\ngovernment toward neutral ships and cargoes exceeds the manifest\\nnecessity of a belligerent and constitutes restrictions upon the rights\\nof American citizens on the high seas, which are not justified by the\\nrules of international law or required under the principle of\\nself-preservation.\"\\n\\n=Germany Begins the Submarine Campaign.=--Germany now announced that, on\\nand after February 18, 1915, the whole of the English Channel and the\\nwaters around Great Britain would be deemed a war zone and that every\\nenemy ship found therein would be destroyed. The German decree added\\nthat, as the British admiralty had ordered the use of neutral flags by\\nEnglish ships in time of distress, neutral vessels would be in danger of\\ndestruction if found in the forbidden area. It was clear that Germany\\nintended to employ submarines to destroy shipping. A new factor was thus\\nintroduced into naval warfare, one not provided for in the accepted laws\\nof war. A warship overhauling a merchant vessel could easily take its\\ncrew and passengers on board for safe keeping as prescribed by\\ninternational law; but a submarine ordinarily could do nothing of the\\nsort. Of necessity the lives and the ships of neutrals, as well as of\\nbelligerents, were put in mortal peril. This amazing conduct Germany\\njustified on the ground that it was mere retaliation against Great\\nBritain for her violations of international law.\\n\\nThe response of the United States to the ominous German order was swift\\nand direct. On February 10, 1915, it warned Germany that if her\\ncommanders destroyed American lives and ships in obedience to that\\ndecree, the action would \"be very hard indeed to reconcile with the\\nfriendly relations happily subsisting between the two governments.\" The\\nAmerican note added that the German imperial government would be held to\\n\"strict accountability\" and all necessary steps would be taken to\\nsafeguard American lives and American rights. This was firm and clear\\nlanguage, but the only response which it evoked from Germany was a\\nsuggestion that, if Great Britain would allow food supplies to pass\\nthrough the blockade, the submarine campaign would be dropped.\\n\\n=Violations of American Rights.=--Meanwhile Germany continued to ravage\\nshipping on the high seas. On January 28, a German raider sank the\\nAmerican ship, _William P. Frye_, in the South Atlantic; on March 28, a\\nBritish ship, the _Falaba_, was sunk by a submarine and many on board,\\nincluding an American citizen, were killed; and on April 28, a German\\nairplane dropped bombs on the American steamer _Cushing_. On the morning\\nof May 1, 1915, Americans were astounded to see in the newspapers an\\nadvertisement, signed by the German Imperial Embassy, warning travelers\\nof the dangers in the war zone and notifying them that any who ventured\\non British ships into that area did so at their own risk. On that day,\\nthe _Lusitania_, a British steamer, sailed from New York for Liverpool.\\nOn May 7, without warning, the ship was struck by two torpedoes and in a\\nfew minutes went down by the bow, carrying to death 1153 persons\\nincluding 114 American men, women, and children. A cry of horror ran\\nthrough the country. The German papers in America and a few American\\npeople argued that American citizens had been duly warned of the danger\\nand had deliberately taken their lives into their own hands; but the\\nterrible deed was almost universally condemned by public opinion.\\n\\n=The _Lusitania_ Notes.=--On May 14, the Department of State at\\nWashington made public the first of three famous notes on the\\n_Lusitania_ case. It solemnly informed the German government that \"no\\nwarning that an unlawful and inhumane act will be committed can possibly\\nbe accepted as an excuse or palliation for that act or as an abatement\\nof the responsibility for its commission.\" It called upon the German\\ngovernment to disavow the act, make reparation as far as possible, and\\ntake steps to prevent \"the recurrence of anything so obviously\\nsubversive of the principles of warfare.\" The note closed with a clear\\ncaution to Germany that the government of the United States would not\\n\"omit any word or any act necessary to the performance of its sacred\\nduty of maintaining the rights of the United States and its citizens and\\nof safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment.\" The die was cast;\\nbut Germany in reply merely temporized.\\n\\nIn a second note, made public on June 11, the position of the United\\nStates was again affirmed. William Jennings Bryan, the Secretary of\\nState, had resigned because the drift of President Wilson\\'s policy was\\nnot toward mediation but the strict maintenance of American rights, if\\nneed be, by force of arms. The German reply was still evasive and German\\nnaval commanders continued their course of sinking merchant ships. In a\\nthird and final note of July 21, 1915, President Wilson made it clear to\\nGermany that he meant what he said when he wrote that he would maintain\\nthe rights of American citizens. Finally after much discussion and\\nshifting about, the German ambassador on September 1, 1915, sent a brief\\nnote to the Secretary of State: \"Liners will not be sunk by our\\nsubmarines without warning and without safety of the lives of\\nnon-combatants, provided the liners do not try to escape or offer\\nresistance.\" Editorially, the New York _Times_ declared: \"It is a\\ntriumph not only of diplomacy but of reason, of humanity, of justice,\\nand of truth.\" The Secretary of State saw in it \"a recognition of the\\nfundamental principles for which we have contended.\"\\n\\n=The Presidential Election of 1916.=--In the midst of this crisis came\\nthe presidential campaign. On the Republican side everything seemed to\\ndepend upon the action of the Progressives. If the breach created in\\n1912 could be closed, victory was possible; if not, defeat was certain.\\nA promise of unity lay in the fact that the conventions of the\\nRepublicans and Progressives were held simultaneously in Chicago. The\\nfriends of Roosevelt hoped that both parties would select him as their\\ncandidate; but this hope was not realized. The Republicans chose, and\\nthe Progressives accepted, Charles E. Hughes, an associate justice of\\nthe federal Supreme Court who, as governor of New York, had won a\\nnational reputation by waging war on \"machine politicians.\"\\n\\nIn the face of the clamor for expressions of sympathy with one or the\\nother of the contending powers of Europe, the Republicans chose a middle\\ncourse, declaring that they would uphold all American rights \"at home\\nand abroad, by land and by sea.\" This sentiment Mr. Hughes echoed in his\\nacceptance speech. By some it was interpreted to mean a firmer policy in\\ndealing with Great Britain; by others, a more vigorous handling of the\\nsubmarine menace. The Democrats, on their side, renominated President\\nWilson by acclamation, reviewed with pride the legislative achievements\\nof the party, and commended \"the splendid diplomatic victories of our\\ngreat President who has preserved the vital interests of our government\\nand its citizens and kept us out of war.\"\\n\\nIn the election which ensued President Wilson\\'s popular vote exceeded\\nthat cast for Mr. Hughes by more than half a million, while his\\nelectoral vote stood 277 to 254. The result was regarded, and not\\nwithout warrant, as a great personal triumph for the President. He had\\nreceived the largest vote yet cast for a presidential candidate. The\\nProgressive party practically disappeared, and the Socialists suffered a\\nsevere set-back, falling far behind the vote of 1912.\\n\\n=President Wilson Urges Peace upon the Warring Nations.=--Apparently\\nconvinced that his pacific policies had been profoundly approved by his\\ncountrymen, President Wilson, soon after the election, addressed \"peace\\nnotes\" to the European belligerents. On December 16, the German Emperor\\nproposed to the Allied Powers that they enter into peace negotiations, a\\nsuggestion that was treated as a mere political maneuver by the opposing\\ngovernments. Two days later President Wilson sent a note to the warring\\nnations asking them to avow \"the terms upon which war might be\\nconcluded.\" To these notes the Central Powers replied that they were\\nready to meet their antagonists in a peace conference; and Allied Powers\\nanswered by presenting certain conditions precedent to a satisfactory\\nsettlement. On January 22, 1917, President Wilson in an address before\\nthe Senate, declared it to be a duty of the United States to take part\\nin the establishment of a stable peace on the basis of certain\\nprinciples. These were, in short: \"peace without victory\"; the right of\\nnationalities to freedom and self-government; the independence of\\nPoland; freedom of the seas; the reduction of armaments; and the\\nabolition of entangling alliances. The whole world was discussing the\\nPresident\\'s remarkable message, when it was dumbfounded to hear, on\\nJanuary 31, that the German ambassador at Washington had announced the\\nofficial renewal of ruthless submarine warfare.\\n\\n\\nTHE UNITED STATES AT WAR\\n\\n=Steps toward War.=--Three days after the receipt of the news that the\\nGerman government intended to return to its former submarine policy,\\nPresident Wilson severed diplomatic relations with the German empire. At\\nthe same time he explained to Congress that he desired no conflict with\\nGermany and would await an \"overt act\" before taking further steps to\\npreserve American rights. \"God grant,\" he concluded, \"that we may not be\\nchallenged to defend them by acts of willful injustice on the part of\\nthe government of Germany.\" Yet the challenge came. Between February 26\\nand April 2, six American merchant vessels were torpedoed, in most cases\\nwithout any warning and without regard to the loss of American lives.\\nPresident Wilson therefore called upon Congress to answer the German\\nmenace. The reply of Congress on April 6 was a resolution, passed with\\nonly a few dissenting votes, declaring the existence of a state of war\\nwith Germany. Austria-Hungary at once severed diplomatic relations with\\nthe United States; but it was not until December 7 that Congress, acting\\non the President\\'s advice, declared war also on that \"vassal of the\\nGerman government.\"\\n\\n=American War Aims.=--In many addresses at the beginning and during the\\ncourse of the war, President Wilson stated the purposes which actuated\\nour government in taking up arms. He first made it clear that it was a\\nwar of self-defense. \"The military masters of Germany,\" he exclaimed,\\n\"denied us the right to be neutral.\" Proof of that lay on every hand.\\nAgents of the German imperial government had destroyed American lives\\nand American property on the high seas. They had filled our communities\\nwith spies. They had planted bombs in ships and munition works. They had\\nfomented divisions among American citizens.\\n\\nThough assailed in many ways and compelled to resort to war, the United\\nStates sought no material rewards. \"The world must be made safe for\\ndemocracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of\\npolitical liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no\\nconquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves.\"\\n\\nIn a very remarkable message read to Congress on January 8, 1918,\\nPresident Wilson laid down his famous \"fourteen points\" summarizing the\\nideals for which we were fighting. They included open treaties of peace,\\nopenly arrived at; absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas; the\\nremoval, as far as possible, of trade barriers among nations; reduction\\nof armaments; adjustment of colonial claims in the interest of the\\npopulations concerned; fair and friendly treatment of Russia; the\\nrestoration of Belgium; righting the wrong done to France in 1871 in the\\nmatter of Alsace-Lorraine; adjustment of Italian frontiers along the\\nlines of nationality; more liberty for the peoples of Austria-Hungary;\\nthe restoration of Serbia and Rumania; the readjustment of the Turkish\\nEmpire; an independent Poland; and an association of nations to afford\\nmutual guarantees to all states great and small. On a later occasion\\nPresident Wilson elaborated the last point, namely, the formation of a\\nleague of nations to guarantee peace and establish justice among the\\npowers of the world. Democracy, the right of nations to determine their\\nown fate, a covenant of enduring peace--these were the ideals for which\\nthe American people were to pour out their blood and treasure.\\n\\n=The Selective Draft.=--The World War became a war of nations. The\\npowers against which we were arrayed had every able-bodied man in\\nservice and all their resources, human and material, thrown into the\\nscale. For this reason, President Wilson summoned the whole people of\\nthe United States to make every sacrifice necessary for victory.\\nCongress by law decreed that the national army should be chosen from all\\nmale citizens and males not enemy aliens who had declared their\\nintention of becoming citizens. By the first act of May 18, 1917, it\\nfixed the age limits at twenty-one to thirty-one inclusive. Later, in\\nAugust, 1918, it extended them to eighteen and forty-five. From the men\\nof the first group so enrolled were chosen by lot the soldiers for the\\nWorld War who, with the regular army and the national guard, formed the\\nAmerican Expeditionary Force upholding the American cause on the\\nbattlefields of Europe. \"The whole nation,\" said the President, \"must be\\na team in which each man shall play the part for which he is best\\nfitted.\"\\n\\n=Liberty Loans and Taxes.=--In order that the military and naval forces\\nshould be stinted in no respect, the nation was called upon to place its\\nfinancial resources at the service of the government. Some urged the\\n\"conscription of wealth as well as men,\" meaning the support of the war\\nout of taxes upon great fortunes; but more conservative counsels\\nprevailed. Four great Liberty Loans were floated, all the agencies of\\nmodern publicity being employed to enlist popular interest. The first\\nloan had four and a half million subscribers; the fourth more than\\ntwenty million. Combined with loans were heavy taxes. A progressive tax\\nwas laid upon incomes beginning with four per cent on incomes in the\\nlower ranges and rising to sixty-three per cent of that part of any\\nincome above $2,000,000. A progressive tax was levied upon inheritances.\\nAn excess profits tax was laid upon all corporations and partnerships,\\nrising in amount to sixty per cent of the net income in excess of\\nthirty-three per cent on the invested capital. \"This,\" said a\\ndistinguished economist, \"is the high-water mark in the history of\\ntaxation. Never before in the annals of civilization has an attempt been\\nmade to take as much as two-thirds of a man\\'s income by taxation.\"\\n\\n=Mobilizing Material Resources.=--No stone was left unturned to provide\\nthe arms, munitions, supplies, and transportation required in the\\ngigantic undertaking. Between the declaration of war and the armistice,\\nCongress enacted law after law relative to food supplies, raw materials,\\nrailways, mines, ships, forests, and industrial enterprises. No power\\nover the lives and property of citizens, deemed necessary to the\\nprosecution of the armed conflict, was withheld from the government. The\\nfarmer\\'s wheat, the housewife\\'s sugar, coal at the mines, labor in the\\nfactories, ships at the wharves, trade with friendly countries, the\\nrailways, banks, stores, private fortunes--all were mobilized and laid\\nunder whatever obligations the government deemed imperative. Never was a\\nnation more completely devoted to a single cause.\\n\\nA law of August 10, 1917, gave the President power to fix the prices of\\nwheat and coal and to take almost any steps necessary to prevent\\nmonopoly and excessive prices. By a series of measures, enlarging the\\nprinciples of the shipping act of 1916, ships and shipyards were brought\\nunder public control and the government was empowered to embark upon a\\ngreat ship-building program. In December, 1917, the government assumed\\nfor the period of the war the operation of the railways under a\\npresidential proclamation which was elaborated in March, 1918, by act of\\nCongress. In the summer of 1918 the express, telephone, and telegraph\\nbusiness of the entire country passed under government control. By war\\nrisk insurance acts allowances were made for the families of enlisted\\nmen, compensation for injuries was provided, death benefits were\\ninstituted, and a system of national insurance was established in the\\ninterest of the men in service. Never before in the history of the\\ncountry had the government taken such a wise and humane view of its\\nobligations to those who served on the field of battle or on the seas.\\n\\n=The Espionage and Sedition Acts.=--By the Espionage law of June 15,\\n1917, and the amending law, known as the Sedition act, passed in May of\\nthe following year, the government was given a drastic power over the\\nexpression of opinion. The first measure penalized those who conveyed\\ninformation to a foreign country to be used to the injury of the United\\nStates; those who made false statements designed to interfere with the\\nmilitary or naval forces of the United States; those who attempted to\\nstir up insubordination or disloyalty in the army and navy; and those\\nwho willfully obstructed enlistment. The Sedition act was still more\\nsevere and sweeping in its terms. It imposed heavy penalties upon any\\nperson who used \"abusive language about the government or institutions\\nof the country.\" It authorized the dismissal of any officer of the\\ngovernment who committed \"disloyal acts\" or uttered \"disloyal language,\"\\nand empowered the Postmaster General to close the mails to persons\\nviolating the law. This measure, prepared by the Department of Justice,\\nencountered vigorous opposition in the Senate, where twenty-four\\nRepublicans and two Democrats voted against it. Senator Johnson of\\nCalifornia denounced it as a law \"to suppress the freedom of the press\\nin the United States and to prevent any man, no matter who he is, from\\nexpressing legitimate criticism concerning the present government.\" The\\nconstitutionality of the acts was attacked; but they were sustained by\\nthe Supreme Court and stringently enforced.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nTHE LAUNCHING OF A SHIP AT THE GREAT NAVAL YARDS, NEWARK, N.J.]\\n\\n=Labor and the War.=--In view of the restlessness of European labor\\nduring the war and especially the proletarian revolution in Russia in\\nNovember, 1917, some anxiety was early expressed as to the stand which\\norganized labor might take in the United States. It was, however, soon\\ndispelled. Samuel Gompers, speaking for the American Federation of\\nLabor, declared that \"this is labor\\'s war,\" and pledged the united\\nsupport of all the unions. There was some dissent. The Socialist party\\ndenounced the war as a capitalist quarrel; but all the protests combined\\nwere too slight to have much effect. American labor leaders were sent to\\nEurope to strengthen the wavering ranks of trade unionists in war-worn\\nEngland, France, and Italy. Labor was given representation on the\\nimportant boards and commissions dealing with industrial questions.\\nTrade union standards were accepted by the government and generally\\napplied in industry. The Department of Labor became one of the powerful\\nwar centers of the nation. In a memorable address to the American\\nFederation of Labor, President Wilson assured the trade unionists that\\nlabor conditions should not be made unduly onerous by the war and\\nreceived in return a pledge of loyalty from the Federation. Recognition\\nof labor\\'s contribution to winning the war was embodied in the treaty of\\npeace, which provided for a permanent international organization to\\npromote the world-wide effort of labor to improve social conditions.\\n\"The league of nations has for its object the establishment of universal\\npeace,\" runs the preamble to the labor section of the treaty, \"and such\\na peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice....\\nThe failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labor is an\\nobstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the\\nconditions in their own countries.\"\\n\\n=The American Navy in the War.=--As soon as Congress declared war the\\nfleet was mobilized, American ports were thrown open to the warships of\\nthe Allies, immediate provision was made for increasing the number of\\nmen and ships, and a contingent of war vessels was sent to cooperate\\nwith the British and French in their life-and-death contest with\\nsubmarines. Special effort was made to stimulate the production of\\n\"submarine chasers\" and \"scout cruisers\" to be sent to the danger zone.\\nConvoys were provided to accompany the transports conveying soldiers to\\nFrance. Before the end of the war more than three hundred American\\nvessels and 75,000 officers and men were operating in European waters.\\nThough the German fleet failed to come out and challenge the sea power\\nof the Allies, the battleships of the United States were always ready to\\ndo their full duty in such an event. As things turned out, the service\\nof the American navy was limited mainly to helping in the campaign that\\nwore down the submarine menace to Allied shipping.\\n\\n=The War in France.=--Owing to the peculiar character of the warfare in\\nFrance, it required a longer time for American military forces to get\\ninto action; but there was no unnecessary delay. Soon after the\\ndeclaration of war, steps were taken to give military assistance to the\\nAllies. The regular army was enlarged and the troops of the national\\nguard were brought into national service. On June 13, General John J.\\nPershing, chosen head of the American Expeditionary Forces, reached\\nParis and began preparations for the arrival of our troops. In June, the\\nvanguard of the army reached France. A slow and steady stream followed.\\nAs soon as the men enrolled under the draft were ready, it became a\\nflood. During the period of the war the army was enlarged from about\\n190,000 men to 3,665,000, of whom more than 2,000,000 were in France\\nwhen the armistice was signed.\\n\\nAlthough American troops did not take part on a large scale until the\\nlast phase of the war in 1918, several battalions of infantry were in\\nthe trenches by October, 1917, and had their first severe encounter with\\nthe Germans early in November. In January, 1918, they took over a part\\nof the front line as an American sector. In March, General Pershing\\nplaced our forces at the disposal of General Foch, commander-in-chief of\\nthe Allied armies. The first division, which entered the Montdidier\\nsalient in April, soon was engaged with the enemy, \"taking with splendid\\ndash the town of Cantigny and all other objectives, which were organized\\nand held steadfastly against vicious counter attacks and galling\\nartillery fire.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\\n\\nTROOPS RETURNING FROM FRANCE]\\n\\nWhen the Germans launched their grand drives toward the Marne and Paris,\\nin June and July, 1918, every available man was placed at General Foch\\'s\\ncommand. At Belleau Wood, at Chateau-Thierry, and other points along the\\ndeep salient made by the Germans into the French lines, American\\nsoldiers distinguished themselves by heroic action. They also played an\\nimportant role in the counter attack that \"smashed\" the salient and\\ndrove the Germans back.\\n\\nIn September, American troops, with French aid, \"wiped out\" the German\\nsalient at St. Mihiel. By this time General Pershing was ready for the\\ngreat American drive to the northeast in the Argonne forest, while he\\nalso cooperated with the British in the assault on the Hindenburg line.\\nIn the Meuse-Argonne battle, our soldiers encountered some of the most\\nsevere fighting of the war and pressed forward steadily against the most\\nstubborn resistance from the enemy. On the 6th of November, reported\\nGeneral Pershing, \"a division of the first corps reached a point on the\\nMeuse opposite Sedan, twenty-five miles from our line of departure. The\\nstrategical goal which was our highest hope was gained. We had cut the\\nenemy\\'s main line of communications and nothing but a surrender or an\\narmistice could save his army from complete disaster.\" Five days later\\nthe end came. On the morning of November 11, the order to cease firing\\nwent into effect. The German army was in rapid retreat and\\ndemoralization had begun. The Kaiser had abdicated and fled into\\nHolland. The Hohenzollern dreams of empire were shattered. In the\\nfifty-second month, the World War, involving nearly every civilized\\nnation on the globe, was brought to a close. More than 75,000 American\\nsoldiers and sailors had given their lives. More than 250,000 had been\\nwounded or were missing or in German prison camps.\\n\\n[Illustration: WESTERN BATTLE LINES OF THE VARIOUS YEARS OF THE\\nWORLD WAR]\\n\\n\\nTHE SETTLEMENT AT PARIS\\n\\n=The Peace Conference.=--On January 18, 1919, a conference of the Allied\\nand Associated Powers assembled to pronounce judgment upon the German\\nempire and its defeated satellites: Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and\\nTurkey. It was a moving spectacle. Seventy-two delegates spoke for\\nthirty-two states. The United States, Great Britain, France, Italy, and\\nJapan had five delegates each. Belgium, Brazil, and Serbia were each\\nassigned three. Canada, Australia, South Africa, India, China, Greece,\\nHedjaz, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Siam, and Czechoslovakia were\\nallotted two apiece. The remaining states of New Zealand, Bolivia, Cuba,\\nEcuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru,\\nand Uruguay each had one delegate. President Wilson spoke in person for\\nthe United States. England, France, and Italy were represented by their\\npremiers: David Lloyd George, Georges Clemenceau, and Vittorio Orlando.\\n\\n[Illustration: PREMIERS LLOYD GEORGE, ORLANDO AND CLEMENCEAU AND\\nPRESIDENT WILSON AT PARIS]\\n\\n=The Supreme Council.=--The real work of the settlement was first\\ncommitted to a Supreme Council of ten representing the United States,\\nGreat Britain, France, Italy, and Japan. This was later reduced to five\\nmembers. Then Japan dropped out and finally Italy, leaving only\\nPresident Wilson and the Premiers, Lloyd George and Clemenceau, the\\n\"Big Three,\" who assumed the burden of mighty decisions. On May 6, their\\nwork was completed and in a secret session of the full conference the\\nwhole treaty of peace was approved, though a few of the powers made\\nreservations or objections. The next day the treaty was presented to the\\nGermans who, after prolonged protests, signed on the last day of grace,\\nJune 28. This German treaty was followed by agreements with Austria,\\nHungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey. Collectively these great documents formed\\nthe legal basis of the general European settlement.\\n\\n=The Terms of the Settlement.=--The combined treaties make a huge\\nvolume. The German treaty alone embraces about 80,000 words.\\nCollectively they cover an immense range of subjects which may be\\nsummarized under five heads: (1) The territorial settlement in Europe;\\n(2) the destruction of German military power; (3) reparations for\\ndamages done by Germany and her allies; (4) the disposition of German\\ncolonies and protectorates; and (5) the League of Nations.\\n\\nGermany was reduced by the cession of Alsace-Lorraine to France and the\\nloss of several other provinces. Austria-Hungary was dissolved and\\ndismembered. Russia was reduced by the creation of new states on the\\nwest. Bulgaria was stripped of her gains in the recent Balkan wars.\\nTurkey was dismembered. Nine new independent states were created:\\nPoland, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia,\\nArmenia, and Hedjaz. Italy, Greece, Rumania, and Serbia were enlarged by\\ncessions of territory and Serbia was transformed into the great state of\\nJugoslavia.\\n\\nThe destruction of German military power was thorough. The entire navy,\\nwith minor exceptions, was turned over to the Allied and Associated\\nPowers; Germany\\'s total equipment for the future was limited to six\\nbattleships and six light cruisers, with certain small vessels but no\\nsubmarines. The number of enlisted men and officers for the army was\\nfixed at not more than 100,000; the General Staff was dissolved; and the\\nmanufacture of munitions restricted.\\n\\nGermany was compelled to accept full responsibility for all damages; to\\npay five billion dollars in cash and goods, and to make certain other\\npayments which might be ordered from time to time by an inter-allied\\nreparations commission. She was also required to deliver to Belgium,\\nFrance, and Italy, millions of tons of coal every year for ten years;\\nwhile by way of additional compensation to France the rich coal basin of\\nthe Saar was placed under inter-allied control to be exploited under\\nFrench administration for a period of at least fifteen years. Austria\\nand the other associates of Germany were also laid under heavy\\nobligations to the victors. Damages done to shipping by submarines and\\nother vessels were to be paid for on the basis of ton for ton.\\n\\nThe disposition of the German colonies and the old Ottoman empire\\npresented knotty problems. It was finally agreed that the German\\ncolonies and Turkish provinces which were in a backward stage of\\ndevelopment should be placed under the tutelage of certain powers acting\\nas \"mandatories\" holding them in \"a sacred trust of civilization.\" An\\nexception to the mandatory principle arose in the case of German rights\\nin Shantung, all of which were transferred directly to Japan. It was\\nthis arrangement that led the Chinese delegation to withhold their\\nsignatures from the treaty.\\n\\n=The League of Nations.=--High among the purposes which he had in mind\\nin summoning the nation to arms, President Wilson placed the desire to\\nput an end to war. All through the United States the people spoke of the\\n\"war to end war.\" No slogan called forth a deeper response from the\\npublic. The President himself repeatedly declared that a general\\nassociation of nations must be formed to guard the peace and protect all\\nagainst the ambitions of the few. \"As I see it,\" he said in his address\\non opening the Fourth Liberty Loan campaign, \"the constitution of the\\nLeague of Nations and the clear definition of its objects must be a\\npart, in a sense the most essential part, of the peace settlement\\nitself.\"\\n\\nNothing was more natural, therefore, than Wilson\\'s insistence at Paris\\nupon the formation of an international association. Indeed he had gone\\nto Europe in person largely to accomplish that end. Part One of the\\ntreaty with Germany, the Covenant of the League of Nations, was due to\\nhis labors more than to any other influence. Within the League thus\\ncreated were to be embraced all the Allied and Associated Powers and\\nnearly all the neutrals. By a two-thirds vote of the League Assembly the\\nexcluded nations might be admitted.\\n\\nThe agencies of the League of Nations were to be three in number: (1) a\\npermanent secretariat located at Geneva; (2) an Assembly consisting of\\none delegate from each country, dominion, or self-governing colony\\n(including Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and India); (3)\\nand a Council consisting of representatives of the United States, Great\\nBritain, France, Italy, and Japan, and four other representatives\\nselected by the Assembly from time to time.\\n\\nThe duties imposed on the League and the obligations accepted by its\\nmembers were numerous and important. The Council was to take steps to\\nformulate a scheme for the reduction of armaments and to submit a plan\\nfor the establishment of a permanent Court of International Justice. The\\nmembers of the League (Article X) were to respect and preserve as\\nagainst external aggression the territorial integrity and existing\\npolitical independence of all the associated nations. They were to\\nsubmit to arbitration or inquiry by the Council all disputes which could\\nnot be adjusted by diplomacy and in no case to resort to war until three\\nmonths after the award. Should any member disregard its covenants, its\\naction would be considered an act of war against the League, which would\\naccordingly cut off the trade and business of the hostile member and\\nrecommend through the Council to the several associated governments the\\nmilitary measures to be taken. In case the decision in any arbitration\\nof a dispute was unanimous, the members of the League affected by it\\nwere to abide by it.\\n\\nSuch was the settlement at Paris and such was the association of nations\\nformed to promote the peace of the world. They were quickly approved by\\nmost of the powers, and the first Assembly of the League of Nations met\\nat Geneva late in 1920.\\n\\n=The Treaty in the United States.=--When the treaty was presented to the\\nUnited States Senate for approval, a violent opposition appeared. In\\nthat chamber the Republicans had a slight majority and a two-thirds vote\\nwas necessary for ratification. The sentiment for and against the treaty\\nran mainly along party lines; but the Republicans were themselves\\ndivided. The major portion, known as \"reservationists,\" favored\\nratification with certain conditions respecting American rights; while a\\nsmall though active minority rejected the League of Nations in its\\nentirety, announcing themselves to be \"irreconcilables.\" The grounds of\\nthis Republican opposition lay partly in the terms of peace imposed on\\nGermany and partly in the Covenant of the League of Nations. Exception\\nwas taken to the clauses which affected the rights of American citizens\\nin property involved in the adjustment with Germany, but the burden of\\ncriticism was directed against the League. Article X guaranteeing\\nagainst external aggression the political independence and territorial\\nintegrity of the members of the League was subjected to a specially\\nheavy fire; while the treatment accorded to China and the sections\\naffecting American internal affairs were likewise attacked as \"unjust\\nand dangerous.\" As an outcome of their deliberations, the Republicans\\nproposed a long list of reservations which touched upon many of the\\nvital parts of the treaty. These were rejected by President Wilson as\\namounting in effect to a \"nullification of the treaty.\" As a deadlock\\nensued the treaty was definitely rejected, owing to the failure of its\\nsponsors to secure the requisite two-thirds vote.\\n\\n[Illustration: EUROPE]\\n\\n=The League of Nations in the Campaign of 1920.=--At this juncture the\\npresidential campaign of 1920 opened. The Republicans, while condemning\\nthe terms of the proposed League, endorsed the general idea of an\\ninternational agreement to prevent war. Their candidate, Senator\\nWarren G. Harding of Ohio, maintained a similar position without saying\\ndefinitely whether the League devised at Paris could be recast in such a\\nmanner as to meet his requirements. The Democrats, on the other hand,\\nwhile not opposing limitations clarifying the obligations of the United\\nStates, demanded \"the immediate ratification of the treaty without\\nreservations which would impair its essential integrity.\" The Democratic\\ncandidate, Governor James M. Cox, of Ohio, announced his firm conviction\\nthat the United States should \"go into the League,\" without closing the\\ndoor to mild reservations; he appealed to the country largely on that\\nissue. The election of Senator Harding, in an extraordinary \"landslide,\"\\ncoupled with the return of a majority of Republicans to the Senate, made\\nuncertain American participation in the League of Nations.\\n\\n=The United States and International Entanglements.=--Whether America\\nentered the League or not, it could not close its doors to the world and\\nescape perplexing international complications. It had ever-increasing\\nfinancial and commercial connections with all other countries. Our\\nassociates in the recent war were heavily indebted to our government.\\nThe prosperity of American industries depended to a considerable extent\\nupon the recovery of the impoverished and battle-torn countries of\\nEurope.\\n\\nThere were other complications no less specific. The United States was\\ncompelled by force of circumstances to adopt a Russian policy. The\\ngovernment of the Czar had been overthrown by a liberal revolution,\\nwhich in turn had been succeeded by an extreme, communist\\n\"dictatorship.\" The Bolsheviki, or majority faction of the socialists,\\nhad obtained control of the national council of peasants, workingmen,\\nand soldiers, called the soviet, and inaugurated a radical regime. They\\nhad made peace with Germany in March, 1918. Thereupon the United States\\njoined England, France, and Japan in an unofficial war upon them. After\\nthe general settlement at Paris in 1919, our government, while\\nwithdrawing troops from Siberia and Archangel, continued in its refusal\\nto recognize the Bolshevists or to permit unhampered trade with them.\\nPresident Wilson repeatedly denounced them as the enemies of\\ncivilization and undertook to lay down for all countries the principles\\nwhich should govern intercourse with Russia.\\n\\nFurther international complications were created in connection with the\\nWorld War, wholly apart from the terms of peace or the League of\\nNations. The United States had participated in a general European\\nconflict which changed the boundaries of countries, called into being\\nnew nations, and reduced the power and territories of the vanquished.\\nAccordingly, it was bound to face the problem of how far it was prepared\\nto cooperate with the victors in any settlement of Europe\\'s\\ndifficulties. By no conceivable process, therefore, could America be\\ndisentangled from the web of world affairs. Isolation, if desirable, had\\nbecome impossible. Within three hundred years from the founding of the\\ntiny settlements at Jamestown and Plymouth, America, by virtue of its\\ninstitutions, its population, its wealth, and its commerce, had become\\nfirst among the nations of the earth. By moral obligations and by\\npractical interests its fate was thus linked with the destiny of all\\nmankind.\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY OF DEMOCRACY AND THE WORLD WAR\\n\\nThe astounding industrial progress that characterized the period\\nfollowing the Civil War bequeathed to the new generation many perplexing\\nproblems connected with the growth of trusts and railways, the\\naccumulation of great fortunes, the increase of poverty in the\\nindustrial cities, the exhaustion of the free land, and the acquisition\\nof dominions in distant seas. As long as there was an abundance of land\\nin the West any able-bodied man with initiative and industry could\\nbecome an independent farmer. People from the cities and immigrants from\\nEurope had always before them that gateway to property and prosperity.\\nWhen the land was all gone, American economic conditions inevitably\\nbecame more like those of Europe.\\n\\nThough the new economic questions had been vigorously debated in many\\ncircles before his day, it was President Roosevelt who first discussed\\nthem continuously from the White House. The natural resources of the\\ncountry were being exhausted; he advocated their conservation. Huge\\nfortunes were being made in business creating inequalities in\\nopportunity; he favored reducing them by income and inheritance taxes.\\nIndustries were disturbed by strikes; he pressed arbitration upon\\ncapital and labor. The free land was gone; he declared that labor was in\\na less favorable position to bargain with capital and therefore should\\norganize in unions for collective bargaining. There had been wrong-doing\\non the part of certain great trusts; those responsible should be\\npunished.\\n\\nThe spirit of reform was abroad in the land. The spoils system was\\nattacked. It was alleged that the political parties were dominated by\\n\"rings and bosses.\" The United States Senate was called \"a millionaires\\'\\nclub.\" Poverty and misery were observed in the cities. State\\nlegislatures and city governments were accused of corruption.\\n\\nIn answer to the charges, remedies were proposed and adopted. Civil\\nservice reform was approved. The Australian ballot, popular election of\\nSenators, the initiative, referendum, and recall, commission and city\\nmanager plans for cities, public regulation of railways, compensation\\nfor those injured in industries, minimum wages for women and children,\\npensions for widows, the control of housing in the cities--these and a\\nhundred other reforms were adopted and tried out. The national watchword\\nbecame: \"America, Improve Thyself.\"\\n\\nThe spirit of reform broke into both political parties. It appeared in\\nmany statutes enacted by Congress under President Taft\\'s leadership. It\\ndisrupted the Republicans temporarily in 1912 when the Progressive party\\nentered the field. It led the Democratic candidate in that year,\\nGovernor Wilson, to make a \"progressive appeal\" to the voters. It\\ninspired a considerable program of national legislation under President\\nWilson\\'s two administrations.\\n\\nIn the age of change, four important amendments to the federal\\nconstitution, the first in more than forty years, were adopted. The\\nsixteenth empowered Congress to lay an income tax. The seventeenth\\nassured popular election of Senators. The eighteenth made prohibition\\nnational. The nineteenth, following upon the adoption of woman suffrage\\nin many states, enfranchised the women of the nation.\\n\\nIn the sphere of industry, equally great changes took place. The major\\nportion of the nation\\'s business passed into the hands of corporations.\\nIn all the leading industries of the country labor was organized into\\ntrade unions and federated in a national organization. The power of\\norganized capital and organized labor loomed upon the horizon. Their\\nstruggles, their rights, and their place in the economy of the nation\\nraised problems of the first magnitude.\\n\\nWhile the country was engaged in a heated debate upon its domestic\\nissues, the World War broke out in Europe in 1914. As a hundred years\\nbefore, American rights upon the high seas became involved at once. They\\nwere invaded on both sides; but Germany, in addition to assailing\\nAmerican ships and property, ruthlessly destroyed American lives. She\\nset at naught the rules of civilized warfare upon the sea. Warnings from\\nPresident Wilson were without avail. Nothing could stay the hand of the\\nGerman war party.\\n\\nAfter long and patient negotiations, President Wilson in 1917 called\\nupon the nation to take up arms against an assailant that had in effect\\ndeclared war upon America. The answer was swift and firm. The national\\nresources, human and material, were mobilized. The navy was enlarged, a\\ndraft army created, huge loans floated, heavy taxes laid, and the spirit\\nof sacrifice called forth in a titanic struggle against an autocratic\\npower that threatened to dominate Europe and the World.\\n\\nIn the end, American financial, naval, and military assistance counted\\nheavily in the scale. American sailors scoured the seas searching for\\nthe terrible submarines. American soldiers took part in the last great\\ndrives that broke the might of Germany\\'s army. Such was the nation\\'s\\nresponse to the President\\'s summons to arms in a war \"for democracy\" and\\n\"to end war.\"\\n\\nWhen victory crowned the arms of the powers united against Germany,\\nPresident Wilson in person took part in the peace council. He sought to\\nredeem his pledge to end wars by forming a League of Nations to keep the\\npeace. In the treaty drawn at the close of the war the first part was a\\ncovenant binding the nations in a permanent association for the\\nsettlement of international disputes. This treaty, the President offered\\nto the United States Senate for ratification and to his country for\\napproval.\\n\\nOnce again, as in the days of the Napoleonic wars, the people seriously\\ndiscussed the place of America among the powers of the earth. The Senate\\nrefused to ratify the treaty. World politics then became an issue in the\\ncampaign of 1920. Though some Americans talked as if the United States\\ncould close its doors and windows against all mankind, the victor in the\\nelection, Senator Harding, of Ohio, knew better. The election returns\\nwere hardly announced before he began to ask the advice of his\\ncountrymen on the pressing theme that would not be downed: \"What part\\nshall America--first among the nations of the earth in wealth and\\npower--assume at the council table of the world?\"\\n\\n\\n=General References=\\n\\nWoodrow Wilson, _The New Freedom_.\\n\\nC.L.

The topical method, however,\\nmay also be pushed too far. Each successive stage of any topic can be\\nunderstood only in relation to the forces of the time. For that reason,\\nthe best results are reached when there is a combination of the\\nchronological and the topical methods. It is therefore suggested that\\nthe teacher first follow the text closely and then review the subject\\nwith the aid of this topical syllabus.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\nFoundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and official\\npage at http://pglaf.org\\n\\nFor additional contact information:\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\n\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\nProject Gutenberg\\'s Manual of Surgery, by Alexis Thomson and Alexander Miles\\n\\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Some may yet have\\nto be unlearned, and others have but little bearing on the problems\\npresented to the civilian surgeon. Save in its broadest principles, the\\nsurgery of warfare is a thing apart from the general surgery of civil\\nlife, and the exhaustive literature now available on every aspect of it\\nmakes it unnecessary that it should receive detailed consideration in a\\nmanual for students. In preparing this new edition, therefore, we have\\nendeavoured to incorporate only such additions to our knowledge and\\nresources as our experience leads us to believe will prove of permanent\\nvalue in civil practice.\\n\\nFor the rest, the text has been revised, condensed, and in places\\nrearranged; a number of old illustrations have been discarded, and a\\ngreater number of new ones added. Descriptions of operative procedures\\nhave been omitted from the _Manual_, as they are to be found in the\\ncompanion volume on _Operative Surgery_, the third edition of which\\nappeared some months ago.\\n\\nWe have retained the Basle anatomical nomenclature, as extended\\nexperience has confirmed our preference for it. For the convenience of\\nreaders who still employ the old terms, these are given in brackets\\nafter the new.\\n\\nThis edition of the _Manual_ appears in three volumes; the first being\\ndevoted to General Surgery, the other two to Regional Surgery. This\\narrangement has enabled us to deal in a more consecutive manner than\\nhitherto with the surgery of the Extremities, including Fractures and\\nDislocations.\\n\\nWe have once more to express our thanks to colleagues in the Edinburgh\\nSchool and to other friends for aiding us in providing new\\nillustrations, and for other valuable help, as well as to our publishers\\nfor their generosity in the matter of illustrations.\\n\\nEDINBURGH,\\n    _March_ 1921.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCONTENTS\\n\\n\\n                                                                   PAGE\\n    CHAPTER I\\n    REPAIR                                                            1\\n\\n    CHAPTER II\\n    CONDITIONS WHICH INTERFERE WITH REPAIR                           17\\n\\n    CHAPTER III\\n    INFLAMMATION                                                     31\\n\\n    CHAPTER IV\\n    SUPPURATION                                                      45\\n\\n    CHAPTER V\\n    ULCERATION AND ULCERS                                            68\\n\\n    CHAPTER VI\\n    GANGRENE                                                         86\\n\\n    CHAPTER VII\\n    BACTERIAL AND OTHER WOUND INFECTIONS                            107\\n\\n    CHAPTER VIII\\n    TUBERCULOSIS                                                    133\\n\\n    CHAPTER IX\\n    SYPHILIS                                                        146\\n\\n    CHAPTER X\\n    TUMOURS                                                         181\\n\\n    CHAPTER XI\\n    INJURIES                                                        218\\n\\n    CHAPTER XII\\n    METHODS OF WOUND TREATMENT                                      241\\n\\n    CHAPTER XIII\\n    CONSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS OF INJURIES                              249\\n\\n    CHAPTER XIV\\n    THE BLOOD VESSELS                                               258\\n\\n    CHAPTER XV\\n    THE LYMPH VESSELS AND GLANDS                                    321\\n\\n    CHAPTER XVI\\n    THE NERVES                                                      342\\n\\n    CHAPTER XVII\\n    SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUES                                   376\\n\\n    CHAPTER XVIII\\n    THE MUSCLES, TENDONS, AND TENDON SHEATHS                        405\\n\\n    CHAPTER XIX\\n    THE BURSAE                                                       426\\n\\n    CHAPTER XX\\n    DISEASES OF BONE                                                434\\n\\n    CHAPTER XXI\\n    DISEASES OF JOINTS                                              501\\n\\n    INDEX                                                           547\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS\\n\\n\\n  FIG.

The two great branches of the healing\\nart--Medicine and Surgery--are so intimately related that it is\\nimpossible to draw a hard-and-fast line between them, but for\\nconvenience Surgery may be defined as \"the art of treating lesions and\\nmalformations of the human body by manual operations, mediate and\\nimmediate.\" To apply his art intelligently and successfully, it is\\nessential that the surgeon should be conversant not only with the normal\\nanatomy and physiology of the body and with the various pathological\\nconditions to which it is liable, but also with the nature of the\\nprocess by which repair of injured or diseased tissues is effected.\\nWithout this knowledge he is unable to recognise such deviations from\\nthe normal as result from mal-development, injury, or disease, or\\nrationally to direct his efforts towards the correction or removal of\\nthese.\\n\\n\\nPROCESS OF REPAIR\\n\\nThe process of repair in living tissue depends upon an inherent power\\npossessed by vital cells of reacting to the irritation caused by injury\\nor disease. The cells of the damaged tissues, under the influence of\\nthis irritation, undergo certain proliferative changes, which are\\ndesigned to restore the normal structure and configuration of the part.\\nThe process by which this restoration is effected is essentially the\\nsame in all tissues, but the extent to which different tissues can carry\\nthe recuperative process varies. Simple structures, such as skin,\\ncartilage, bone, periosteum, and tendon, for example, have a high power\\nof regeneration, and in them the reparative process may result in almost\\nperfect restitution to the normal. More complex structures, on the other\\nhand, such as secreting glands, muscle, and the tissues of the central\\nnervous system, are but imperfectly restored, simple cicatricial\\nconnective tissue taking the place of what has been lost or destroyed.\\nAny given tissue can be replaced only by tissue of a similar kind, and\\nin a damaged part each element takes its share in the reparative process\\nby producing new material which approximates more or less closely to the\\nnormal according to the recuperative capacity of the particular tissue.\\nThe normal process of repair may be interfered with by various\\nextraneous agencies, the most important of which are infection by\\ndisease-producing micro-organisms, the presence of foreign substances,\\nundue movement of the affected part, and improper applications and\\ndressings. The effect of these agencies is to delay repair or to prevent\\nthe individual tissues carrying the process to the furthest degree of\\nwhich they are capable.\\n\\nIn the management of wounds and other diseased conditions the main\\nobject of the surgeon is to promote the natural reparative process by\\npreventing or eliminating any factor by which it may be disturbed.\\n\\n#Healing by Primary Union.#--The most favourable conditions for the\\nprogress of the reparative process are to be found in a clean-cut wound\\nof the integument, which is uncomplicated by loss of tissue, by the\\npresence of foreign substances, or by infection with disease-producing\\nmicro-organisms, and its edges are in contact. Such a wound in virtue of\\nthe absence of infection is said to be _aseptic_, and under these\\nconditions healing takes place by what is called \"primary union\"--the\\n\"healing by first intention\" of the older writers.\\n\\n#Granulation Tissue.#--The essential and invariable medium of repair in\\nall structures is an elementary form of new tissue known as _granulation\\ntissue_, which is produced in the damaged area in response to the\\nirritation caused by injury or disease. The vital reaction induced by\\nsuch irritation results in dilatation of the vessels of the part,\\nemigration of leucocytes, transudation of lymph, and certain\\nproliferative changes in the fixed tissue cells. These changes are\\ncommon to the processes of inflammation and repair; no hard-and-fast\\nline can be drawn between these processes, and the two may go on\\ntogether. It is, however, only when the proliferative changes have come\\nto predominate that the reparative process is effectively established by\\nthe production of healthy granulation tissue.\\n\\n_Formation of Granulation Tissue._--When a wound is made in the\\nintegument under aseptic conditions, the passage of the knife through\\nthe tissues is immediately followed by an oozing of blood, which soon\\ncoagulates on the cut surfaces. In each of the divided vessels a clot\\nforms, and extends as far as the nearest collateral branch; and on the\\nsurface of the wound there is a microscopic layer of bruised and\\ndevitalised tissue. If the wound is closed, the narrow space between its\\nedges is occupied by blood-clot, which consists of red and white\\ncorpuscles mixed with a quantity of fibrin, and this forms a temporary\\nuniting medium between the divided surfaces. During the first twelve\\nhours, the minute vessels in the vicinity of the wound dilate, and from\\nthem lymph exudes and leucocytes migrate into the tissues. In from\\ntwenty-four to thirty-six hours, the capillaries of the part adjacent to\\nthe wound begin to throw out minute buds and fine processes, which\\nbridge the gap and form a firmer, but still temporary, connection\\nbetween the two sides. Each bud begins in the wall of the capillary as a\\nsmall accumulation of granular protoplasm, which gradually elongates\\ninto a filament containing a nucleus. This filament either joins with a\\nneighbouring capillary or with a similar filament, and in time these\\nbecome hollow and are filled with blood from the vessels that gave them\\norigin. In this way a series of young _capillary loops_ is formed.\\n\\nThe spaces between these loops are filled by cells of various kinds, the\\nmost important being the _fibroblasts_, which are destined to form\\ncicatricial fibrous tissue. These fibroblasts are large irregular\\nnucleated cells derived mainly from the proliferation of the fixed\\nconnective-tissue cells of the part, and to a less extent from the\\nlymphocytes and other mononuclear cells which have migrated from the\\nvessels. Among the fibroblasts, larger multi-nucleated cells--_giant\\ncells_--are sometimes found, particularly when resistant substances,\\nsuch as silk ligatures or fragments of bone, are embedded in the\\ntissues, and their function seems to be to soften such substances\\npreliminary to their being removed by the phagocytes. Numerous\\n_polymorpho-nuclear leucocytes_, which have wandered from the vessels,\\nare also present in the spaces. These act as phagocytes, their function\\nbeing to remove the red corpuscles and fibrin of the original clot, and\\nthis performed, they either pass back into the circulation in virtue of\\ntheir amoeboid movement, or are themselves eaten up by the growing\\nfibroblasts. Beyond this phagocytic action, they do not appear to play\\nany direct part in the reparative process. These young capillary loops,\\nwith their supporting cells and fluids, constitute granulation tissue,\\nwhich is usually fully formed in from three to five days, after which it\\nbegins to be replaced by cicatricial or scar tissue.\\n\\n_Formation of Cicatricial Tissue._--The transformation of this temporary\\ngranulation tissue into scar tissue is effected by the fibroblasts,\\nwhich become elongated and spindle-shaped, and produce in and around\\nthem a fine fibrillated material which gradually increases in quantity\\ntill it replaces the cell protoplasm. In this way white fibrous tissue\\nis formed, the cells of which are arranged in parallel lines and\\neventually become grouped in bundles, constituting fully formed white\\nfibrous tissue. In its growth it gradually obliterates the capillaries,\\nuntil at the end of two, three, or four weeks both vessels and cells\\nhave almost entirely disappeared, and the original wound is occupied by\\ncicatricial tissue. In course of time this tissue becomes consolidated,\\nand the cicatrix undergoes a certain amount of contraction--_cicatricial\\ncontraction_.\\n\\n_Healing of Epidermis._--While these changes are taking place in the\\ndeeper parts of the wound, the surface is being covered over by\\n_epidermis_ growing in from the margins. Within twelve hours the cells\\nof the rete Malpighii close to the cut edge begin to sprout on to the\\nsurface of the wound, and by their proliferation gradually cover the\\ngranulations with a thin pink pellicle. As the epithelium increases in\\nthickness it assumes a bluish hue and eventually the cells become\\ncornified and the epithelium assumes a greyish-white colour.\\n\\n_Clinical Aspects._--So long as the process of repair is not complicated\\nby infection with micro-organisms, there is no interference with the\\ngeneral health of the patient. The temperature remains normal; the\\ncirculatory, gastro-intestinal, nervous, and other functions are\\nundisturbed; locally, the part is cool, of natural colour and free from\\npain.\\n\\n#Modifications of the Process of Repair.#--The process of repair by\\nprimary union, above described, is to be looked upon as the type of all\\nreparative processes, such modifications as are met with depending\\nmerely upon incidental differences in the conditions present, such as\\nloss of tissue, infection by micro-organisms, etc.\\n\\n_Repair after Loss or Destruction of Tissue._--When the edges of a wound\\ncannot be approximated either because tissue has been lost, for example\\nin excising a tumour or because a drainage tube or gauze packing has\\nbeen necessary, a greater amount of granulation tissue is required to\\nfill the gap, but the process is essentially the same as in the ideal\\nmethod of repair.\\n\\nThe raw surface is first covered by a layer of coagulated blood and\\nfibrin. An extensive new formation of capillary loops and fibroblasts\\ntakes place towards the free surface, and goes on until the gap is\\nfilled by a fine velvet-like mass of granulation tissue. This\\ngranulation tissue is gradually replaced by young cicatricial tissue,\\nand the surface is covered by the ingrowth of epithelium from the edges.\\n\\nThis modification of the reparative process can be best studied\\nclinically in a recent wound which has been packed with gauze. When the\\nplug is introduced, the walls of the cavity consist of raw tissue with\\nnumerous oozing blood vessels. On removing the packing on the fifth or\\nsixth day, the surface is found to be covered with minute, red,\\npapillary granulations, which are beginning to fill up the cavity. At\\nthe edges the epithelium has proliferated and is covering over the newly\\nformed granulation tissue. As lymph and leucocytes escape from the\\nexposed surface there is a certain amount of serous or sero-purulent\\ndischarge. On examining the wound at intervals of a few days, it is\\nfound that the granulation tissue gradually increases in amount till the\\ngap is completely filled up, and that coincidently the epithelium\\nspreads in and covers over its surface. In course of time the epithelium\\nthickens, and as the granulation tissue is slowly replaced by young\\ncicatricial tissue, which has a peculiar tendency to contract and so to\\nobliterate the blood vessels in it, the scar that is left becomes\\nsmooth, pale, and depressed. This method of healing is sometimes spoken\\nof as \"healing by granulation\"--although, as we have seen, it is by\\ngranulation that all repair takes place.\\n\\n_Healing by Union of two Granulating Surfaces._--In gaping wounds union\\nis sometimes obtained by bringing the two surfaces into apposition after\\neach has become covered with healthy granulations. The exudate on the\\nsurfaces causes them to adhere, capillary loops pass from one to the\\nother, and their final fusion takes place by the further development of\\ngranulation and cicatricial tissue.\\n\\n_Reunion of Parts entirely Separated from the Body._--Small portions of\\ntissue, such as the end of a finger, the tip of the nose or a portion of\\nthe external ear, accidentally separated from the body, if accurately\\nreplaced and fixed in position, occasionally adhere by primary union.\\n\\nIn the course of operations also, portions of skin, fascia, or bone, or\\neven a complete joint may be transplanted, and unite by primary union.\\n\\n_Healing under a Scab._--When a small superficial wound is exposed to\\nthe air, the blood and serum exuded on its surface may dry and form a\\nhard crust or _scab_, which serves to protect the surface from external\\nirritation in the same way as would a dry pad of sterilised gauze. Under\\nthis scab the formation of granulation tissue, its transformation into\\ncicatricial tissue, and the growth of epithelium on the surface, go on\\nuntil in the course of time the crust separates, leaving a scar.\\n\\n_Healing by Blood-clot._--In subcutaneous wounds, for example tenotomy,\\nin amputation wounds, and in wounds made in excising tumours or in\\noperating upon bones, the space left between the divided tissues becomes\\nfilled with blood-clot, which acts as a temporary scaffolding in which\\ngranulation tissue is built up. Capillary loops grow into the coagulum,\\nand migrated leucocytes from the adjacent blood vessels destroy the red\\ncorpuscles, and are in turn disposed of by the developing fibroblasts,\\nwhich by their growth and proliferation fill up the gap with young\\nconnective tissue. It will be evident that this process only differs\\nfrom healing by primary union in the _amount_ of blood-clot that is\\npresent.\\n\\n_Presence of a Foreign Body._--When an aseptic foreign body is present\\nin the tissues, _e.g._ a piece of unabsorbable chromicised catgut, the\\nhealing process may be modified. After primary union has taken place the\\nscar may broaden, become raised above the surface, and assume a\\nbluish-brown colour; the epidermis gradually thins and gives way,\\nrevealing the softened portion of catgut, which can be pulled out in\\npieces, after which the wound rapidly heals and resumes a normal\\nappearance.\\n\\n\\nREPAIR IN INDIVIDUAL TISSUES\\n\\n_Skin and Connective Tissue._--The mode of regeneration of these tissues\\nunder aseptic conditions has already been described as the type of ideal\\nrepair. In highly vascular parts, such as the face, the reparative\\nprocess goes on with great rapidity, and even extensive wounds may be\\nfirmly united in from three to five days. Where the anastomosis is less\\nfree the process is more prolonged. The more highly organised elements\\nof the skin, such as the hair follicles, the sweat and sebaceous glands,\\nare imperfectly reproduced; hence the scar remains smooth, dry, and\\nhairless.\\n\\n_Epithelium._--Epithelium is only reproduced from pre-existing\\nepithelium, and, as a rule, from one of a similar type, although\\nmetaplastic transformation of cells of one kind of epithelium into\\nanother kind can take place. Thus a granulating surface may be covered\\nentirely by the ingrowing of the cutaneous epithelium from the margins;\\nor islets, originating in surviving cells of sebaceous glands or sweat\\nglands, or of hair follicles, may spring up in the centre of the raw\\narea. Such islets may also be due to the accidental transference of\\nloose epithelial cells from the edges. Even the fluid from a blister, in\\nvirtue of the isolated cells of the rete Malpighii which it contains, is\\ncapable of starting epithelial growth on a granulating surface. Hairs\\nand nails may be completely regenerated if a sufficient amount of the\\nhair follicles or of the nail matrix has escaped destruction. The\\nepithelium of a mucous membrane is regenerated in the same way as that\\non a cutaneous surface.\\n\\nEpithelial cells have the power of living for some time after being\\nseparated from their normal surroundings, and of growing again when once\\nmore placed in favourable circumstances. On this fact the practice of\\nskin grafting is based (p. 11).\\n\\n_Cartilage._--When an articular cartilage is divided by incision or by\\nbeing implicated in a fracture involving the articular end of a bone, it\\nis repaired by ordinary cicatricial fibrous tissue derived from the\\nproliferating cells of the perichondrium. Cartilage being a non-vascular\\ntissue, the reparative process goes on slowly, and it may be many weeks\\nbefore it is complete.\\n\\nIt is possible for a metaplastic transformation of connective-tissue\\ncells into cartilage cells to take place, the characteristic hyaline\\nmatrix being secreted by the new cells. This is sometimes observed as an\\nintermediary stage in the healing of fractures, especially in young\\nbones. It may also take place in the regeneration of lost portions of\\ncartilage, provided the new tissue is so situated as to constitute part\\nof a joint and to be subjected to pressure by an opposing cartilaginous\\nsurface. This is illustrated by what takes place after excision of\\njoints where it is desired to restore the function of the articulation.\\nBy carrying out movements between the constituent parts, the fibrous\\ntissue covering the ends of the bones becomes moulded into shape, its\\ncells take on the characters of cartilage cells, and, forming a matrix,\\nso develop a new cartilage.\\n\\nConversely, it is observed that when articular cartilage is no longer\\nsubjected to pressure by an opposing cartilage, it tends to be\\ntransformed into fibrous tissue, as may be seen in deformities attended\\nwith displacement of articular surfaces, such as hallux valgus and\\nclub-foot.\\n\\nAfter fractures of costal cartilage or of the cartilages of the larynx\\nthe cicatricial tissue may be ultimately replaced by bone.\\n\\n_Tendons._--When a tendon is divided, for example by subcutaneous\\ntenotomy, the end nearer the muscle fibres is drawn away from the other,\\nleaving a gap which is speedily filled by blood-clot. In the course of a\\nfew days this clot becomes permeated by granulation tissue, the\\nfibroblasts of which are derived from the sheath of the tendon, the\\nsurrounding connective tissue, and probably also from the divided ends\\nof the tendon itself. These fibroblasts ultimately develop into typical\\ntendon cells, and the fibres which they form constitute the new tendon\\nfibres. Under aseptic conditions repair is complete in from two to three\\nweeks. In the course of the reparative process the tendon and its sheath\\nmay become adherent, which leads to impaired movement and stiffness. If\\nthe ends of an accidentally divided tendon are at once brought into\\naccurate apposition and secured by sutures, they unite directly with a\\nminimum amount of scar tissue, and function is perfectly restored.\\n\\n_Muscle._--Unstriped muscle does not seem to be capable of being\\nregenerated to any but a moderate degree. If the ends of a divided\\nstriped muscle are at once brought into apposition by stitches, primary\\nunion takes place with a minimum of intervening fibrous tissue. The\\nnuclei of the muscle fibres in close proximity to this young cicatricial\\ntissue proliferate, and a few new muscle fibres may be developed, but\\nany gross loss of muscular tissue is replaced by a fibrous cicatrix. It\\nwould appear that portions of muscle transplanted from animals to fill\\nup gaps in human muscle are similarly replaced by fibrous tissue. When a\\nmuscle is paralysed from loss of its nerve supply and undergoes complete\\ndegeneration, it is not capable of being regenerated, even should the\\nintegrity of the nerve be restored, and so its function is permanently\\nlost.\\n\\n_Secretory Glands._--The regeneration of secretory glands is usually\\nincomplete, cicatricial tissue taking the place of the glandular\\nsubstance which has been destroyed. In wounds of the liver, for example,\\nthe gap is filled by fibrous tissue, but towards the periphery of the\\n\\nwound the liver cells proliferate and a certain amount of regeneration\\ntakes place. In the kidney also, repair mainly takes place by\\ncicatricial tissue, and although a few collecting tubules may be\\nreformed, no regeneration of secreting tissue takes place. After the\\noperation of decapsulation of the kidney a new capsule is formed, and\\nduring the process young blood vessels permeate the superficial parts\\nof the kidney and temporarily increase its blood supply, but in the\\nconsolidation of the new fibrous tissue these vessels are ultimately\\nobliterated. This does not prove that the operation is useless, as the\\ntemporary improvement of the circulation in the kidney may serve to tide\\nthe patient over a critical period of renal insufficiency.\\n\\n_Stomach and Intestine._--Provided the peritoneal surfaces are\\naccurately apposed, wounds of the stomach and intestine heal with great\\nrapidity. Within a few hours the peritoneal surfaces are glued together\\nby a thin layer of fibrin and leucocytes, which is speedily organised\\nand replaced by fibrous tissue. Fibrous tissue takes the place of the\\nmuscular elements, which are not regenerated. The mucous lining is\\nrestored by ingrowth from the margins, and there is evidence that some\\nof the secreting glands may be reproduced.\\n\\nHollow viscera, like the oesophagus and urinary bladder, in so far\\nas they are not covered by peritoneum, heal less rapidly.\\n\\n_Nerve Tissues._--There is no trustworthy evidence that regeneration of\\nthe tissues of the brain or spinal cord in man ever takes place. Any\\nloss of substance is replaced by cicatricial tissue.\\n\\nThe repair of _Bone_, _Blood Vessels_, and _Peripheral Nerves_ is more\\nconveniently considered in the chapters dealing with these structures.\\n\\n#Rate of Healing.#--While the rate at which wounds heal is remarkably\\nconstant there are certain factors that influence it in one direction or\\nthe other. Healing is more rapid when the edges are in contact, when\\nthere is a minimum amount of blood-clot between them, when the patient\\nis in normal health and the vitality of the tissues has not been\\nimpaired. Wounds heal slightly more quickly in the young than in the\\nold, although the difference is so small that it can only be\\ndemonstrated by the most careful observations.\\n\\nCertain tissues take longer to heal than others: for example, a fracture\\nof one of the larger long bones takes about six weeks to unite, and\\ndivided nerve trunks take much longer--about a year.\\n\\nWounds of certain parts of the body heal more quickly than others: those\\nof the scalp, face, and neck, for example, heal more quickly than those\\nover the buttock or sacrum, probably because of their greater\\nvascularity.\\n\\nThe extent of the wound influences the rate of healing; it is only\\n\\nnatural that a long and deep wound should take longer to heal than a\\nshort and superficial one, because there is so much more work to be\\ndone in the conversion of blood-clot into granulation tissue, and this\\nagain into scar tissue that will be strong enough to stand the strain on\\nthe edges of the wound.\\n\\n\\nTHE TRANSPLANTATION OR GRAFTING OF TISSUES\\n\\nConditions are not infrequently met with in which healing is promoted\\nand restoration of function made possible by the transference of a\\nportion of tissue from one part of the body to another; the tissue\\ntransferred is known as the _graft_ or the _transplant_. The simplest\\nexample of grafting is the transplantation of skin.\\n\\nIn order that the graft may survive and have a favourable chance of\\n\"taking,\" as it is called, the transplanted tissue must retain its\\nvitality until it has formed an organic connection with the tissue in\\nwhich it is placed, so that it may derive the necessary nourishment from\\nits new bed. When these conditions are fulfilled the tissues of the\\ngraft continue to proliferate, producing new tissue elements to replace\\nthose that are lost and making it possible for the graft to become\\nincorporated with the tissue with which it is in contact.\\n\\nDead tissue, on the other hand, can do neither of these things; it is\\nonly capable of acting as a model, or, at the most, as a scaffolding for\\nsuch mobile tissue elements as may be derived from, the parent tissue\\nwith which the graft is in contact: a portion of sterilised marine\\nsponge, for example, may be observed to become permeated with\\ngranulation tissue when it is embedded in the tissues.\\n\\nA successful graft of living tissue is not only capable of regeneration,\\nbut it acquires a system of lymph and blood vessels, so that in time it\\nbleeds when cut into, and is permeated by new nerve fibres spreading in\\nfrom the periphery towards the centre.\\n\\nIt is instructive to associate the period of survival of the different\\ntissues of the body after death, with their capacity of being used for\\ngrafting purposes; the higher tissues such as those of the central\\nnervous system and highly specialised glandular tissues like those of\\nthe kidney lose their vitality quickly after death and are therefore\\nuseless for grafting; connective tissues, on the other hand, such as\\nfat, cartilage, and bone retain their vitality for several hours after\\ndeath, so that when they are transplanted, they readily \"take\" and do\\nall that is required of them: the same is true of the skin and its\\nappendages.\\n\\n_Sources of Grafts._--It is convenient to differentiate between\\n_autoplastic_ grafts, that is those derived from the same individual;\\n_homoplastic_ grafts, derived from another animal of the same species;\\nand _heteroplastic_ grafts, derived from an animal of another species.\\nOther conditions being equal, the prospects of success are greatest with\\nautoplastic grafts, and these are therefore preferred whenever possible.\\n\\nThere are certain details making for success that merit attention: the\\ngraft must not be roughly handled or allowed to dry, or be subjected to\\nchemical irritation; it must be brought into accurate contact with the\\nnew soil, no blood-clot intervening between the two, no movement of the\\none upon the other should be possible and all infection must be\\nexcluded; it will be observed that these are exactly the same conditions\\nthat permit of the primary healing of wounds, with which of course the\\nhealing of grafts is exactly comparable.\\n\\n_Preservation of Tissues for Grafting._--It was at one time believed\\nthat tissues might be taken from the operating theatre and kept in cold\\nstorage until they were required. It is now agreed that tissues which\\nhave been separated from the body for some time inevitably lose their\\nvitality, become incapable of regeneration, and are therefore unsuited\\nfor grafting purposes. If it is intended to preserve a portion of tissue\\nfor future grafting, it should be embedded in the subcutaneous tissue of\\nthe abdominal wall until it is wanted; this has been carried out with\\nportions of costal cartilage and of bone.\\n\\n\\nINDIVIDUAL TISSUES AS GRAFTS\\n\\n#The Blood# lends itself in an ideal manner to transplantation, or, as\\nit has long been called, _transfusion_. Being always a homoplastic\\ntransfer, the new blood is not always tolerated by the old, in which\\ncase biochemical changes occur, resulting in haemolysis, which\\ncorresponds to the disintegration of other unsuccessful homoplastic\\ngrafts. (See article on Transfusion, _Op. Surg._, p. 37.)\\n\\n#The Skin.#--The skin was the first tissue to be used for grafting\\npurposes, and it is still employed with greater frequency than any\\nother, as lesions causing defects of skin are extremely common and\\nwithout the aid of grafts are tedious in healing.\\n\\nSkin grafts may be applied to a raw surface or to one that is covered\\nwith granulations.\\n\\n_Skin grafting of raw surfaces_ is commonly indicated after operations\\nfor malignant disease in which considerable areas of skin must be\\nsacrificed, and after accidents, such as avulsion of the scalp by\\nmachinery.\\n\\n_Skin grafting of granulating surfaces_ is chiefly employed to promote\\nhealing in the large defects of skin caused by severe burns; the\\ngrafting is carried out when the surface is covered by a uniform layer\\nof healthy granulations and before the inevitable contraction of scar\\ntissue makes itself manifest. Before applying the grafts it is usual to\\nscrape away the granulations until the young fibrous tissue underneath\\nis exposed, but, if the granulations are healthy and can be rendered\\naseptic, the grafts may be placed on them directly.\\n\\nIf it is decided to scrape away the granulations, the oozing must be\\narrested by pressure with a pad of gauze, a sheet of dental rubber or\\ngreen protective is placed next the raw surface to prevent the gauze\\nadhering and starting the bleeding afresh when it is removed.\\n\\n#Methods of Skin-Grafting.#--Two methods are employed: one in which the\\nepidermis is mainly or exclusively employed--epidermis or epithelial\\ngrafting; the other, in which the graft consists of the whole thickness\\nof the true skin--cutis-grafting.\\n\\n_Epidermis or Epithelial Grafting._--The method introduced by the late\\nProfessor Thiersch of Leipsic is that almost universally practised. It\\nconsists in transplanting strips of epidermis shaved from the surface of\\nthe skin, the razor passing through the tips of the papillae, which\\nappear as tiny red points yielding a moderate ooze of blood.\\n\\nThe strips are obtained from the front and lateral aspects of the thigh\\nor upper arm, the skin in those regions being pliable and comparatively\\nfree from hairs.\\n\\nThey are cut with a sharp hollow-ground razor or with Thiersch\\'s\\ngrafting knife, the blade of which is rinsed in alcohol and kept\\nmoistened with warm saline solution. The cutting is made easier if the\\nskin is well stretched and kept flat and perfectly steady, the\\noperator\\'s left hand exerting traction on the skin behind, the hands of\\nthe assistant on the skin in front, one above and the other below the\\nseat of operation. To ensure uniform strips being cut, the razor is kept\\nparallel with the surface and used with a short, rapid, sawing movement,\\nso that, with a little practice, grafts six or eight inches long by one\\nor two inches broad can readily be cut. The patient is given a general\\nanaesthetic, or regional anaesthesia is obtained by injections of a\\nsolution of one per cent. novocain into the line of the lateral and\\nmiddle cutaneous nerves; the disinfection of the skin is carried out on\\nthe usual lines, any chemical agent being finally got rid of, however,\\nby means of alcohol followed by saline solution.\\n\\nThe strips of epidermis wrinkle up on the knife and are directly\\ntransferred to the surface, for which they should be made to form a\\ncomplete carpet, slightly overlapping the edges of the area and of one\\nanother; some blunt instrument is used to straighten out the strips,\\nwhich are then subjected to firm pressure with a pad of gauze to express\\nblood and air-bells and to ensure accurate contact, for this must be as\\nclose as that between a postage stamp and the paper to which it is\\naffixed.\\n\\nAs a dressing for the grafted area and of that also from which the\\ngrafts have been taken, gauze soaked in _liquid paraffin_--the patent\\nvariety known as _ambrine_ is excellent--appears to be the best; the\\ngauze should be moistened every other day or so with fresh paraffin, so\\nthat, at the end of a week, when the grafts should have united, the\\ngauze can be removed without risk of detaching them. _Dental wax_ is\\nanother useful type of dressing; as is also _picric acid_ solution. Over\\nthe gauze, there is applied a thick layer of cotton wool, and the whole\\ndressing is kept in place by a firmly applied bandage, and in the case\\nof the limbs some form of splint should be added to prevent movement.\\n\\nA dressing may be dispensed with altogether, the grafts being protected\\nby a wire cage such as is used after vaccination, but they tend to dry\\nup and come to resemble a scab.\\n\\nWhen the grafts have healed, it is well to protect them from injury and\\nto prevent them drying up and cracking by the liberal application of\\nlanoline or vaseline.\\n\\nThe new skin is at first insensitive and is fixed to the underlying\\nconnective tissue or bone, but in course of time (from six weeks\\nonwards) sensation returns and the formation of elastic tissue beneath\\nrenders the skin pliant and movable so that it can be pinched up between\\nthe finger and thumb.\\n\\n_Reverdin\\'s_ method consists in planting out pieces of skin not bigger\\nthan a pin-head over a granulating surface. It is seldom employed.\\n\\n_Grafts of the Cutis Vera._--Grafts consisting of the entire thickness\\nof the true skin were specially advocated by Wolff and are often\\nassociated with his name. They should be cut oval or spindle-shaped, to\\nfacilitate the approximation of the edges of the resulting wound. The\\ngraft should be cut to the exact size of the surface it is to cover;\\nGillies believes that tension of the graft favours its taking. These\\ngrafts may be placed either on a fresh raw surface or on healthy\\ngranulations. It is sometimes an advantage to stitch them in position,\\nespecially on the face. The dressing and the after-treatment are the\\nsame as in epidermis grafting.\\n\\nThere is a degree of uncertainty about the graft retaining its vitality\\nlong enough to permit of its deriving the necessary nourishment from its\\nnew surroundings; in a certain number of cases the flap dies and is\\nthrown off as a slough--moist or dry according to the presence or\\nabsence of septic infection.\\n\\nThe technique for cutis-grafting must be without a flaw, and the asepsis\\nabsolute; there must not only be a complete absence of movement, but\\nthere must be no traction on the flap that will endanger its blood\\nsupply.\\n\\nOwing to the uncertainty in the results of cutis-grafting the\\n_two-stage_ or _indirect method_ has been introduced, and its almost\\nuniform success has led to its sphere of application being widely\\nextended. The flap is raised as in the direct method but is left\\nattached at one of its margins for a period ranging from 14 to 21 days\\nuntil its blood supply from its new bed is assured; the detachment is\\nthen made complete. The blood supply of the proposed flap may influence\\nits selection and the way in which it is fashioned; for example, a flap\\ncut from the side of the head to fill a defect in the cheek, having in\\nits margin of attachment or pedicle the superficial temporal artery, is\\nmore likely to take than a flap cut with its base above.\\n\\nAnother modification is to raise the flap but leave it connected at both\\nends like the piers of a bridge; this method is well suited to defects\\nof skin on the dorsum of the fingers, hand and forearm, the bridge of\\nskin is raised from the abdominal wall and the hand is passed beneath it\\nand securely fixed in position; after an interval of 14 to 21 days, when\\nthe flap is assured of its blood supply, the piers of the bridge are\\ndivided (Fig. 1). With undermining it is usually easy to bring the\\nedges of the gap in the abdominal wall together, even in children; the\\nskin flap on the dorsum of the hand appears rather thick and\\nprominent--almost like the pad of a boxing-glove--for some time, but\\nthe restoration of function in the capacity to flex the fingers is\\ngratifying in the extreme.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Ulcer of back of Hand covered by flap of skin\\nraised from anterior abdominal wall. The lateral edges of the flap are\\ndivided after the graft has adhered.]\\n\\nThe indirect element of this method of skin-grafting may be carried\\nstill further by transferring the flap of skin first to one part of the\\nbody and then, after it has taken, transferring it to a third part.\\nGillies has especially developed this method in the remedying of\\ndeformities of the face caused by gunshot wounds and by petrol burns in\\nair-men. A rectangular flap of skin is marked out in the neck and chest,\\nthe lateral margins of the flap are raised sufficiently to enable them\\nto be brought together so as to form a tube of skin: after the\\ncirculation has been restored, the lower end of the tube is detached and\\nis brought up to the lip or cheek, or eyelid, where it is wanted; when\\nthis end has derived its new blood supply, the other end is detached\\nfrom the neck and brought up to where it is wanted. In this way, skin\\nfrom the chest may be brought up to form a new forehead and eyelids.\\n\\nGrafts of _mucous membrane_ are used to cover defects in the lip, cheek,\\nand conjunctiva. The technique is similar to that employed in\\nskin-grafting; the sources of mucous membrane are limited and the\\nelement of septic infection cannot always be excluded.\\n\\n_Fat._--Adipose tissue has a low vitality, but it is easily retained and\\nit readily lends itself to transplantation. Portions of fat are often\\nobtainable at operations--from the omentum, for example, otherwise the\\nsubcutaneous fat of the buttock is the most accessible; it may be\\nemployed to fill up cavities of all kinds in order to obtain more rapid\\nand sounder healing and also to remedy deformity, as in filling up a\\ndepression in the cheek or forehead. It is ultimately converted into\\nordinary connective tissue _pari passu_ with the absorption of the fat.\\n\\nThe _fascia lata of the thigh_ is widely and successfully used as a\\ngraft to fill defects in the dura mater, and interposed between the\\nbones of a joint--if the articular cartilage has been destroyed--to\\nprevent the occurrence of ankylosis.\\n\\nThe _peritoneum_ of hydrocele and hernial sacs and of the omentum\\nreadily lends itself to transplantation.\\n\\n_Cartilage and bone_, next to skin, are the tissues most frequently\\nemployed for grafting purposes; their sphere of action is so extensive\\nand includes so much of technical detail in their employment, that they\\nwill be considered later with the surgery of the bones and joints and\\nwith the methods of re-forming the nose.\\n\\n_Tendons and blood vessels_ readily lend themselves to transplantation\\nand will also be referred to later.\\n\\n_Muscle and nerve_, on the other hand, do not retain their vitality when\\nsevered from their surroundings and do not functionate as grafts except\\nfor their connective-tissue elements, which it goes without saying are\\nmore readily obtainable from other sources.\\n\\nPortions of the _ovary_ and of the _thyreoid_ have been successfully\\ntransplanted into the subcutaneous cellular tissue of the abdominal wall\\nby Tuffier and others. In these new surroundings, the ovary or thyreoid\\nis vascularised and has been shown to functionate, but there is not\\nsufficient regeneration of the essential tissue elements to \"carry on\";\\nthe secreting tissue is gradually replaced by connective tissue and the\\nspecial function comes to an end. Even such temporary function may,\\nhowever, tide a patient over a difficult period.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nCONDITIONS WHICH INTERFERE WITH REPAIR\\n\\n\\nSURGICAL BACTERIOLOGY\\n\\nWant of rest--Irritation--Unhealthy tissues--Pathogenic bacteria.\\n    SURGICAL BACTERIOLOGY--General characters of\\n    bacteria--Classification of bacteria--Conditions of bacterial\\n    life--Pathogenic powers of bacteria--Results of bacterial\\n    growth--Death of bacteria--Immunity--Antitoxic sera--Identification\\n    of bacteria--Pyogenic bacteria.\\n\\nIn the management of wounds and other surgical conditions it is\\nnecessary to eliminate various extraneous influences which tend to delay\\nor arrest the natural process of repair.\\n\\nOf these, one of the most important is undue movement of the affected\\npart. \"The first and great requisite for the restoration of injured\\nparts is _rest_,\" said John Hunter; and physiological and mechanical\\nrest as the chief of natural therapeutic agents was the theme of John\\nHilton\\'s classical work--_Rest and Pain_. In this connection it must be\\nunderstood that \"rest\" implies more than the mere state of physical\\nrepose: all physiological as well as mechanical function must be\\nprevented as far as is possible. For instance, the constituent bones of\\na joint affected with tuberculosis must be controlled by splints or\\nother appliances so that no movement can take place between them, and\\nthe limb may not be used for any purpose; physiological rest may be\\nsecured to an inflamed colon by making an artificial anus in the caecum;\\nthe activity of a diseased kidney may be diminished by regulating the\\nquantity and quality of the fluids taken by the patient.\\n\\nAnother source of interference with repair in wounds is _irritation_,\\neither by mechanical agents such as rough, unsuitable dressings,\\nbandages, or ill-fitting splints; or by chemical agents in the form of\\nstrong lotions or other applications.\\n\\nAn _unhealthy or devitalised condition of the patient\\'s tissues_ also\\nhinders the reparative process. Bruised or lacerated skin heals less\\nkindly than skin cut with a smooth, sharp instrument; and persistent\\n\\nvenous congestion of a part, such as occurs, for example, in the leg\\nwhen the veins are varicose, by preventing the access of healthy blood,\\ntends to delay the healing of open wounds. The existence of grave\\nconstitutional disease, such as Bright\\'s disease, diabetes, syphilis,\\nscurvy, or alcoholism, also impedes healing.\\n\\nInfection by disease-producing micro-organisms or _pathogenic bacteria_\\nis, however, the most potent factor in disturbing the natural process of\\nrepair in wounds.\\n\\n\\nSURGICAL BACTERIOLOGY\\n\\nThe influence of micro-organisms in the causation of disease, and the\\nrole played by them in interfering with the natural process of repair,\\nare so important that the science of applied bacteriology has now come\\nto dominate every department of surgery, and it is from the standpoint\\nof bacteriology that nearly all surgical questions have to be\\nconsidered.\\n\\nThe term _sepsis_ as now used in clinical surgery no longer retains its\\noriginal meaning as synonymous with \"putrefaction,\" but is employed to\\ndenote all conditions in which bacterial infection has taken place, and\\nmore particularly those in which pyogenic bacteria are present. In the\\nsame way the term _aseptic_ conveys the idea of freedom from all forms\\nof bacteria, putrefactive or otherwise; and the term _antiseptic_ is\\nused to denote a power of counteracting bacteria and their products.\\n\\n#General Characters of Bacteria.#--A _bacterium_ consists of a finely\\ngranular mass of protoplasm, enclosed in a thin gelatinous envelope.\\nMany forms are motile--some in virtue of fine thread-like flagella, and\\nothers through contractility of the protoplasm. The great majority\\nmultiply by simple fission, each parent cell giving rise to two daughter\\ncells, and this process goes on with extraordinary rapidity. Other\\nvarieties, particularly bacilli, are propagated by the formation of\\n_spores_. A spore is a minute mass of protoplasm surrounded by a dense,\\ntough membrane, developed in the interior of the parent cell. Spores are\\nremarkable for their tenacity of life, and for the resistance they offer\\nto the action of heat and chemical germicides.\\n\\nBacteria are most conveniently classified according to their shape. Thus\\nwe recognise (1) those that are globular--_cocci_; (2) those that\\nresemble a rod--_bacilli_; (3) the spiral or wavy forms--_spirilla_.\\n\\n_Cocci_ or _micrococci_ are minute round bodies, averaging about 1 u in\\ndiameter. The great majority are non-motile. They multiply by fission;\\nand when they divide in such a way that the resulting cells remain in\\npairs, are called _diplococci_, of which the bacteria of gonorrhoea and\\npneumonia are examples (Fig. 5). When they divide irregularly, and form\\ngrape-like bunches, they are known as _staphylococci_, and to this\\n\\nvariety the commonest pyogenic or pus-forming organisms belong (Fig. 2).\\nWhen division takes place only in one axis, so that long chains are\\nformed, the term _streptococcus_ is applied (Fig. 3). Streptococci are\\nmet with in erysipelas and various other inflammatory and suppurative\\nprocesses of a spreading character.\\n\\n_Bacilli_ are rod-shaped bacteria, usually at least twice as long as\\nthey are broad (Fig. 4). Some multiply by fission, others by\\nsporulation. Some forms are motile, others are non-motile. Tuberculosis,\\ntetanus, anthrax, and many other surgical diseases are due to different\\nforms of bacilli.\\n\\n_Spirilla_ are long, slender, thread-like cells, more or less spiral or\\nwavy. Some move by a screw-like contraction of the protoplasm, some by\\nflagellae. The spirochaete associated with syphilis (Fig. 36) is the most\\nimportant member of this group.\\n\\n#Conditions of Bacterial Life.#--Bacteria require for their growth and\\ndevelopment a suitable food-supply in the form of proteins,\\ncarbohydrates, and salts of calcium and potassium which they break up\\ninto simpler elements. An alkaline medium favours bacterial growth; and\\nmoisture is a necessary condition; spores, however, can survive the want\\nof water for much longer periods than fully developed bacteria. The\\nnecessity for oxygen varies in different species. Those that require\\noxygen are known as _aerobic bacilli_ or _aerobes_; those that cannot\\nlive in the presence of oxygen are spoken of as _anaerobes_. The great\\nmajority of bacteria, however, while they prefer to have oxygen, are\\nable to live without it, and are called _facultative anaerobes_.\\n\\nThe most suitable temperature for bacterial life is from 95 o to 102 o F.,\\nroughly that of the human body. Extreme or prolonged cold paralyses but\\ndoes not kill micro-organisms. Few, however, survive being raised to a\\ntemperature of 134 1/2 o F. Boiling for ten to twenty minutes will kill all\\nbacteria, and the great majority of spores. Steam applied in an\\nautoclave under a pressure of two atmospheres destroys even the most\\nresistant spores in a few minutes. Direct sunlight, electric light, or\\neven diffuse daylight, is inimical to the growth of bacteria, as are\\nalso Rontgen rays and radium emanations.\\n\\n#Pathogenic Properties of Bacteria.#--We are now only concerned with\\npathogenic bacteria--that is, bacteria capable of producing disease in\\nthe human subject. This capacity depends upon two sets of factors--(1)\\ncertain features peculiar to the invading bacteria, and (2) others\\npeculiar to the host. Many bacteria have only the power of living upon\\ndead matter, and are known as _saphrophytes_. Such as do nourish in\\nliving tissue are, by distinction, known as _parasites_. The power a\\ngiven parasitic micro-organism has of multiplying in the body and giving\\nrise to disease is spoken of as its _virulence_, and this varies not\\nonly with different species, but in the same species at different times\\nand under varying circumstances. The actual number of organisms\\nintroduced is also an important factor in determining their pathogenic\\npower. Healthy tissues can resist the invasion of a certain number of\\nbacteria of a given species, but when that number is exceeded, the\\norganisms get the upper hand and disease results. When the organisms\\ngain access directly to the blood-stream, as a rule they produce their\\neffects more certainly and with greater intensity than when they are\\nintroduced into the tissues.\\n\\nFurther, the virulence of an organism is modified by the condition of\\nthe patient into whose tissues it is introduced. So long as a person is\\nin good health, the tissues are able to resist the attacks of moderate\\nnumbers of most bacteria. Any lowering of the vitality of the\\nindividual, however, either locally or generally, at once renders him\\nmore susceptible to infection. Thus bruised or torn tissue is much more\\nliable to infection with pus-producing organisms than tissues clean-cut\\nwith a knife; also, after certain diseases, the liability to infection\\nby the organisms of diphtheria, pneumonia, or erysipelas is much\\nincreased. Even such slight depression of vitality as results from\\nbodily fatigue, or exposure to cold and damp, may be sufficient to turn\\nthe scale in the battle between the tissues and the bacteria. Age is an\\nimportant factor in regard to the action of certain bacteria. Young\\nsubjects are attacked by diphtheria, tuberculosis, acute osteomyelitis,\\nand some other diseases with greater frequency and severity than those\\nof more advanced years.\\n\\nIn different races, localities, environment, and seasons, the pathogenic\\npowers of certain organisms, such as those of erysipelas, diphtheria,\\nand acute osteomyelitis, vary considerably.\\n\\nThere is evidence that a _mixed infection_--that is, the introduction of\\nmore than one species of organism, for example, the tubercle bacillus\\nand a pyogenic staphylococcus--increases the severity of the resulting\\ndisease. If one of the varieties gain the ascendancy, the poisons\\nproduced by the others so devitalise the tissue cells, and diminish\\ntheir power of resistance, that the virulence of the most active\\norganisms is increased. On the other hand, there is reason to believe\\nthat the products of certain organisms antagonise one another--for\\nexample, an attack of erysipelas may effect the cure of a patch of\\ntuberculous lupus.\\n\\nLastly, in patients suffering from chronic wasting diseases, bacteria\\nmay invade the internal organs by the blood-stream in enormous numbers\\nand with great rapidity, during the period of extreme debility which\\nshortly precedes death. The discovery of such collections of organisms\\non post-mortem examination may lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn\\nas to the cause of death.\\n\\n#Results of Bacterial Growth.#--Some organisms, such as those of tetanus\\nand erysipelas, and certain of the pyogenic bacteria, show little\\ntendency to pass far beyond the point at which they gain an entrance to\\nthe body. Others, on the contrary--for example, the tubercle bacillus\\nand the organism of acute osteomyelitis--although frequently remaining\\nlocalised at the seat of inoculation, tend to pass to distant parts,\\nlodging in the capillaries of joints, bones, kidney, or lungs, and there\\nproducing their deleterious effects.\\n\\nIn the human subject, multiplication in the blood-stream does not occur\\nto any great extent. In some general acute pyogenic infections, such as\\nosteomyelitis, cellulitis, etc., pure cultures of staphylococci or of\\nstreptococci may be obtained from the blood. In pneumococcal and typhoid\\ninfections, also, the organisms may be found in the blood.\\n\\nIt is by the vital changes they bring about in the parts where they\\nsettle that micro-organisms disturb the health of the patient. In\\nderiving nourishment from the complex organic compounds in which they\\nnourish, the organisms evolve, probably by means of a ferment, certain\\nchemical products of unknown composition, but probably colloidal in\\nnature, and known as _toxins_. When these poisons are absorbed into the\\ngeneral circulation they give rise to certain groups of symptoms--such\\nas rise of temperature, associated circulatory and respiratory\\nderangements, interference with the gastro-intestinal functions and also\\nwith those of the nervous system--which go to make up the condition\\nknown as blood-poisoning, toxaemia, or _bacterial intoxication_. In\\naddition to this, certain bacteria produce toxins that give rise to\\ndefinite and distinct groups of symptoms--such as the convulsions of\\ntetanus, or the paralyses that follow diphtheria.\\n\\n_Death of Bacteria._--Under certain circumstances, it would appear that\\nthe accumulation of the toxic products of bacterial action tends to\\ninterfere with the continued life and growth of the organisms\\nthemselves, and in this way the natural cure of certain diseases is\\nbrought about. Outside the body, bacteria may be killed by starvation,\\nby want of moisture, by being subjected to high temperature, or by the\\naction of certain chemical agents of which carbolic acid, the\\nperchloride and biniodide of mercury, and various chlorine preparations\\nare the most powerful.\\n\\n#Immunity.#--Some persons are insusceptible to infection by certain\\ndiseases, from which they are said to enjoy a _natural immunity_. In\\nmany acute diseases one attack protects the patient, for a time at\\nleast, from a second attack--_acquired immunity_.\\n\\n_Phagocytosis._--In the production of immunity the leucocytes and\\ncertain other cells play an important part in virtue of the power they\\npossess of ingesting bacteria and of destroying them by a process of\\nintra-cellular digestion. To this process Metchnikoff gave the name of\\n_phagocytosis_, and he recognised two forms of _phagocytes_: (1) the\\n_microphages_, which are the polymorpho-nuclear leucocytes of the blood;\\nand (2) the _macrophages_, which include the larger hyaline leucocytes,\\nendothelial cells, and connective-tissue corpuscles.\\n\\nDuring the process of phagocytosis, the polymorpho-nuclear leucocytes in\\nthe circulating blood increase greatly in numbers (_leucocytosis_), as\\nwell as in their phagocytic action, and in the course of destroying the\\nbacteria they produce certain ferments which enter the blood serum.\\nThese are known as _opsonins_ or _alexins_, and they act on the bacteria\\nby a process comparable to narcotisation, and render them an easy prey\\nfor the phagocytes.\\n\\n_Artificial or Passive Immunity._--A form of immunity can be induced by\\nthe introduction of protective substances obtained from an animal which\\nhas been actively immunised. The process by which passive immunity is\\nacquired depends upon the fact that as a result of the reaction between\\nthe specific virus of a particular disease (the _antigen_) and the\\ntissues of the animal attacked, certain substances--_antibodies_--are\\nproduced, which when transferred to the body of a susceptible animal\\nprotect it against that disease. The most important of these antibodies\\nare the _antitoxins_. From the study of the processes by which immunity\\nis secured against the effects of bacterial action the serum and vaccine\\nmethods of treating certain infective diseases have been evolved. The\\n_serum treatment_ is designed to furnish the patient with a sufficiency\\nof antibodies to neutralise the infection. The anti-diphtheritic and the\\nanti-tetanic act by neutralising the specific toxins of the\\ndisease--_antitoxic serums_; the anti-streptcoccic and the serum for\\nanthrax act upon the bacteria--_anti-bacterial serums_.\\n\\nA _polyvalent_ serum, that is, one derived from an animal which has been\\nimmunised by numerous strains of the organism derived from various\\nsources, is much more efficacious than when a single strain has been\\nused.\\n\\n_Clinical Use of Serums._--Every precaution must be taken to prevent\\norganismal contamination of the serum or of the apparatus by means of\\nwhich it is injected. Syringes are so made that they can be sterilised\\nby boiling. The best situations for injection are under the skin of the\\nabdomen, the thorax, or the buttock, and the skin should be purified at\\nthe seat of puncture. If the bulk of the full dose is large, it should\\nbe divided and injected into different parts of the body, not more than\\n20 c.c. being injected at one place. The serum may be introduced\\ndirectly into a vein, or into the spinal canal, _e.g._ anti-tetanic\\nserum. The immunity produced by injections of antitoxic sera lasts only\\nfor a comparatively short time, seldom longer than a few weeks.\\n\\n_\"Serum Disease\" and Anaphylaxis._--It is to be borne in mind that some\\npatients exhibit a supersensitiveness with regard to protective sera, an\\ninjection being followed in a few days by the appearance of an\\nurticarial or erythematous rash, pain and swelling of the joints, and a\\nvariable degree of fever. These symptoms, to which the name _serum\\ndisease_ is applied, usually disappear in the course of a few days.\\n\\nThe term _anaphylaxis_ is applied to an allied condition of\\nsupersensitiveness which appears to be induced by the injection of\\ncertain substances, including toxins and sera, that are capable of\\nacting as antigens. When a second injection is given after an interval\\nof some days, if anaphylaxis has been established by the first dose, the\\npatient suddenly manifests toxic symptoms of the nature of profound\\nshock which may even prove fatal. The conditions which render a person\\nliable to develop anaphylaxis and the mechanism by which it is\\nestablished are as yet imperfectly understood.\\n\\n_Vaccine Treatment._--The vaccine treatment elaborated by A. E. Wright\\nconsists in injecting, while the disease is still active, specially\\nprepared dead cultures of the causative organisms, and is based on the\\nfact that these \"vaccines\" render the bacteria in the tissues less able\\nto resist the attacks of the phagocytes. The method is most successful\\nwhen the vaccine is prepared from organisms isolated from the patient\\nhimself, _autogenous vaccine_, but when this is impracticable, or takes\\na considerable time, laboratory-prepared polyvalent _stock vaccines_ may\\nbe used.\\n\\n_Clinical Use of Vaccines._--Vaccines should not be given while a\\npatient is in a negative phase, as a certain amount of the opsonin in\\nthe blood is used up in neutralising the substances injected, and this\\nmay reduce the opsonic index to such an extent that the vaccines\\nthemselves become dangerous. As a rule, the propriety of using a vaccine\\ncan be determined from the general condition of the patient. The initial\\ndose should always be a small one, particularly if the disease is acute,\\nand the subsequent dosage will be regulated by the effect produced. If\\nmarked constitutional disturbance with rise of temperature follows the\\nuse of a vaccine, it indicates a negative phase, and calls for a\\ndiminution in the next dose. If, on the other hand, the local as well as\\nthe general condition of the patient improves after the injection, it\\nindicates a positive phase, and the original dose may be repeated or\\neven increased. Vaccines are best introduced subcutaneously, a part\\nbeing selected which is not liable to pressure, as there is sometimes\\nconsiderable local reaction. Repeated doses may be necessary at\\nintervals of a few days.\\n\\nThe vaccine treatment has been successfully employed in various\\ntuberculous lesions, in pyogenic infections such as acne, boils,\\nsycosis, streptococcal, pneumococcal, and gonococcal conditions, in\\ninfections of the accessory air sinuses, and in other diseases caused by\\nbacteria.\\n\\n\\nPYOGENIC BACTERIA\\n\\nFrom the point of view of the surgeon the most important varieties of\\nmicro-organisms are those that cause inflammation and suppuration--the\\n_pyogenic bacteria_. This group includes a great many species, and these\\nare so widely distributed that they are to be met with under all\\nconditions of everyday life.\\n\\nThe nature of the inflammatory and suppurative processes will be\\nconsidered in detail later; suffice it here to say that they are brought\\nabout by the action of one or other of the organisms that we have now to\\nconsider.\\n\\nIt is found that the _staphylococci_, which cluster into groups, tend to\\nproduce localised lesions; while the chain-forms--_streptococci_--give\\nrise to diffuse, spreading conditions. Many varieties of pyogenic\\nbacteria have now been differentiated, the best known being the\\nstaphylococcus aureus, the streptococcus, and the bacillus coli\\ncommunis.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Staphylococcus aureus in Pus from case of\\nOsteomyelitis. x 1000 diam. Gram\\'s stain.]\\n\\n_Staphylococcus Aureus._--This is the commonest organism found in\\nlocalised inflammatory and suppurative conditions. It varies greatly in\\nits virulence, and is found in such widely different conditions as skin\\npustules, boils, carbuncles, and some acute inflammations of bone. As\\nseen by the microscope it occurs in grape-like clusters, fission of the\\nindividual cells taking place irregularly (Fig. 2). When grown in\\nartificial media, the colonies assume an orange-yellow colour--hence the\\nname _aureus_. It is of high vitality and resists more prolonged\\nexposure to high temperatures than most non-sporing bacteria. It is\\ncapable of lying latent in the tissues for long periods, for example, in\\nthe marrow of long bones, and of again becoming active and causing a\\nfresh outbreak of suppuration. This organism is widely distributed: it\\nis found on the skin, in the mouth, and in other situations in the body,\\nand as it is present in the dust of the air and on all objects upon\\nwhich dust has settled, it is a continual source of infection unless\\nmeans are taken to exclude it from wounds.\\n\\nThe _staphylococcus albus_ is much less common than the aureus, but has\\nthe same properties and characters, save that its growth on artificial\\nmedia assumes a white colour. It is the common cause of stitch\\nabscesses, the skin being its normal habitat.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Streptococci in Pus from an acute abscess in\\nsubcutaneous tissue. x 1000 diam. Gram\\'s stain.]\\n\\n_Streptococcus Pyogenes._--This organism also varies greatly in its\\nvirulence; in some instances--for example in erysipelas--it causes a\\nsharp attack of acute spreading inflammation, which soon subsides\\nwithout showing any tendency to end in suppuration; under other\\nconditions it gives rise to a generalised infection which rapidly proves\\nfatal. The streptococcus has less capacity of liquefying the tissues\\nthan the staphylococcus, so that pus formation takes place more slowly.\\nAt the same time its products are very potent in destroying the tissues\\nin their vicinity, and so interfering with the exudation of leucocytes\\nwhich would otherwise exercise their protective influence. Streptococci\\ninvade the lymph spaces, and are associated with acute spreading\\nconditions such as phlegmonous or erysipelatous inflammations and\\nsuppurations, lymphangitis and suppuration in lymph glands, and\\ninflammation of serous and synovial membranes, also with a form of\\npneumonia which is prone to follow on severe operations in the mouth and\\nthroat. Streptococci are also concerned in the production of spreading\\ngangrene and pyaemia.\\n\\nDivision takes place in one axis, so that chains of varying length are\\nformed (Fig. 3). It is less easily cultivated by artificial media than\\nthe staphylococcus; it forms a whitish growth.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Bacillus coli communis in Urine, from a case of\\nCystitis. x 1000 diam. Leishman\\'s stain.]\\n\\n_Bacillus Coli Communis._--This organism, which is a normal inhabitant\\nof the intestinal tract, shows a great tendency to invade any organ or\\ntissue whose vitality is lowered. It is causatively associated with such\\nconditions as peritonitis and peritoneal suppuration resulting from\\nstrangulated hernia, appendicitis, or perforation in any part of the\\nalimentary canal. In cystitis, pyelitis, abscess of the kidney,\\nsuppuration in the bile-ducts or liver, and in many other abdominal\\nconditions, it plays a most important part. The discharge from wounds\\ninfected by this organism has usually a foetid, or even a faecal odour,\\nand often contains gases resulting from putrefaction.\\n\\nIt is a small rod-shaped organism with short flagellae, which render it\\nmotile (Fig. 4). It closely resembles the typhoid bacillus, but is\\ndistinguished from it by its behaviour in artificial culture media.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Fraenkel\\'s Pneumococci in Pus from Empyema\\nfollowing Pneumonia. x 100 diam. Stained with Muir\\'s capsule stain.]\\n\\n_Pneumo-bacteria._--Two forms of organism associated with\\npneumonia--_Fraenkel\\'s pneumococcus_ (one of the diplococci) (Fig. 5)\\nand _Friedlander\\'s pneumo-bacillus_ (a short rod-shaped form)--are\\nfrequently met with in inflammations of the serous and synovial\\nmembranes, in suppuration in the liver, and in various other\\ninflammatory and suppurative conditions.\\n\\n_Bacillus Typhosus._--This organism has been found in pure culture in\\nsuppurative conditions of bone, of cellular tissue, and of internal\\norgans, especially during convalescence from typhoid fever. Like the\\nstaphylococcus, it is capable of lying latent in the tissues for long\\nperiods.\\n\\n_Other Pyogenic Bacteria._--It is not necessary to do more than name\\nsome of the other organisms that are known to be pyogenic, such as the\\nbacillus pyocyaneus, which is found in green and blue pus, the\\nmicrococcus tetragenus, the gonococcus, actinomyces, the glanders\\nbacillus, and the tubercle bacillus. Most of these will receive further\\nmention in connection with the diseases to which they give rise.\\n\\n#Leucocytosis.#--Most bacterial diseases, as well as certain other\\npathological conditions, are associated with an increase in the number\\nof leucocytes in the blood throughout the circulatory system. This\\ncondition of the blood, which is known as _leucocytosis_, is believed to\\nbe due to an excessive output and rapid formation of leucocytes by the\\nbone marrow, and it probably has as its object the arrest and\\ndestruction of the invading organisms or toxins. To increase the\\nresisting power of the system to pathogenic organisms, an artificial\\nleucocytosis may be induced by subcutaneous injection of a solution of\\nnucleinate of soda (16 minims of a 5 per cent. solution).\\n\\nThe _normal_ number of leucocytes per cubic millimetre varies in\\ndifferent individuals, and in the same individual under different\\nconditions, from 5000 to 10,000: 7500 is a normal average, and anything\\nabove 12,000 is considered abnormal. When leucocytosis is present, the\\nnumber may range from 12,000 to 30,000 or even higher; 40,000 is looked\\nupon as a high degree of leucocytosis. According to Ehrlich, the\\nfollowing may be taken as the standard proportion of the various forms\\nof leucocytes in normal blood: polynuclear neutrophile leucocytes, 70 to\\n72 per cent.; lymphocytes, 22 to 25 per cent.; eosinophile cells, 2 to 4\\nper cent.; large mononuclear and transitional leucocytes, 2 to 4 per\\ncent.; mast-cells, 0.5 to 2 per cent.\\n\\nIn estimating the clinical importance of a leucocytosis, it is not\\nsufficient merely to count the aggregate number of leucocytes present. A\\ndifferential count must be made to determine which variety of cells is\\nin excess. In the majority of surgical affections it is chiefly the\\ngranular polymorpho-nuclear neutrophile leucocytes that are in excess\\n(_ordinary leucocytosis_). In some cases, and particularly in parasitic\\ndiseases such as trichiniasis and hydatid disease, the eosinophile\\nleucocytes also show a proportionate increase (_eosinophilia_). The term\\n_lymphocytosis_ is applied when there is an increase in the number of\\ncirculating lymphocytes, as occurs, for example, in lymphatic leucaemia,\\nand in certain cases of syphilis.\\n\\nLeucocytosis is met with in nearly all acute infective diseases, and in\\nacute pyogenic inflammatory affections, particularly in those attended\\nwith suppuration. In exceptionally acute septic conditions the extreme\\nvirulence of the toxins may prevent the leucocytes reacting, and\\nleucocytosis may be absent. The absence of leucocytosis in a disease in\\nwhich it is usually present is therefore to be looked upon as a grave\\nomen, particularly when the general symptoms are severe. In some cases\\nof malignant disease the number of leucocytes is increased to 15,000 or\\n20,000. A few hours after a severe haemorrhage also there is usually a\\nleucocytosis of from 15,000 to 30,000, which lasts for three or four\\ndays (Lyon). In cases of haemorrhage the leucocytosis is increased by\\ninfusion of fluids into the circulation. After all operations there is\\nat least a transient leucocytosis (_post-operative leucocytosis_)\\n(F. I. Dawson).\\n\\nThe leucocytosis begins soon after the infection manifests itself--for\\nexample, by shivering, rigor, or rise of temperature. The number of\\nleucocytes rises somewhat rapidly, increases while the condition is\\nprogressing, and remains high during the febrile period, but there is no\\nconstant correspondence between the number of leucocytes and the height\\nof the temperature. The arrest of the inflammation and its resolution\\nare accompanied by a fall in the number of leucocytes, while the\\noccurrence of suppuration is attended with a further increase in their\\nnumber.\\n\\nIn interpreting the \"blood count,\" it is to be kept in mind that a\\n_physiological leucocytosis_ occurs within three or four hours of taking\\na meal, especially one rich in proteins, from 1500 to 2000 being added\\nto the normal number. In this _digestion leucocytosis_ the increase is\\nchiefly in the polynuclear neutrophile leucocytes. Immediately before\\nand after delivery, particularly in primiparae, there is usually a\\nmoderate degree of leucocytosis. If the labour is normal and the\\npuerperium uncomplicated, the number of leucocytes regains the normal in\\nabout a week. Lactation has no appreciable effect on the number of\\nleucocytes. In new-born infants the leucocyte count is abnormally high,\\nranging from 15,000 to 20,000. In children under one year of age, the\\nnormal average is from 10,000 to 20,000.\\n\\n_Absence of Leucocytosis--Leucopenia._--In certain infective diseases\\nthe number of leucocytes in the circulating blood is abnormally\\nlow--3000 or 4000--and this condition is known as _leucopenia_. It\\noccurs in typhoid fever, especially in the later stages of the disease,\\nin tuberculous lesions unaccompanied by suppuration, in malaria, and in\\nmost cases of uncomplicated influenza. The occurrence of leucocytosis in\\nany of these conditions is to be looked upon as an indication that a\\nmixed infection has taken place, and that some suppurative process is\\npresent.\\n\\nThe absence of leucocytosis in some cases of virulent septic poisoning\\nhas already been referred to.\\n\\nIt will be evident that too much reliance must not be placed upon a\\nsingle observation, particularly in emergency cases. Whenever possible,\\na series of observations should be made, the blood being examined about\\nfour hours after meals, and about the same hour each day.\\n\\nThe clinical significance of the blood count in individual diseases will\\nbe further referred to.\\n\\n_The Iodine or Glycogen Reaction._--The leucocyte count may be\\nsupplemented by staining films of the blood with a watery solution of\\niodine and potassium iodide. In all advancing purulent conditions, in\\nseptic poisonings, in pneumonia, and in cancerous growths associated\\nwith ulceration, a certain number of the polynuclear leucocytes are\\nstained a brown or reddish-brown colour, due to the action of the iodine\\non some substance in the cells of the nature of glycogen. This reaction\\nis absent in serous effusions, in unmixed tuberculous infections, in\\nuncomplicated typhoid fever, and in the early stages of cancerous\\ngrowths.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nINFLAMMATION\\n\\n\\nDefinition--Nature of inflammation from surgical point of\\n    view--Sequence of changes in bacterial inflammation--Clinical\\n    aspects of inflammation--General principles of treatment--Chronic\\n    inflammation.\\n\\nInflammation may be defined as the series of vital changes that occurs\\nin the tissues in response to irritation. These changes represent the\\nreaction of the tissue elements to the irritant, and constitute the\\nattempt made by nature to arrest or to limit its injurious effects, and\\nto repair the damage done by it.\\n\\nThe phenomena which characterise the inflammatory reaction can be\\ninduced by any form of irritation--such, for example, as mechanical\\ninjury, the application of heat or of chemical substances, or the action\\nof pathogenic bacteria and their toxins--and they are essentially\\nsimilar in kind whatever the irritant may be. The extent to which the\\nprocess may go, however, and its effects on the part implicated and on\\nthe system as a whole, vary with different irritants and with the\\nintensity and duration of their action. A mechanical, a thermal, or a\\nchemical irritant, acting alone, induces a degree of reaction directly\\nproportionate to its physical properties, and so long as it does not\\ncompletely destroy the vitality of the part involved, the changes in the\\ntissues are chiefly directed towards repairing the damage done to the\\npart, and the inflammatory reaction is not only compatible with the\\noccurrence of ideal repair, but may be looked upon as an integral step\\nin the reparative process.\\n\\nThe irritation caused by infection with bacteria, on the other hand, is\\ncumulative, as the organisms not only multiply in the tissues, but in\\naddition produce chemical poisons (toxins) which aggravate the\\nirritative effects. The resulting reaction is correspondingly\\nprogressive, and has as its primary object the expulsion of the irritant\\nand the limitation of its action. If the natural protective effort is\\nsuccessful, the resulting tissue changes subserve the process of repair,\\nbut if the bacteria gain the upper hand in the struggle, the\\ninflammatory reaction becomes more intense, certain of the tissue\\nelements succumb, and the process for the time being is a destructive\\none. During the stage of bacterial inflammation, reparative processes\\nare in abeyance, and it is only after the inflammation has been allayed,\\neither by natural means or by the aid of the surgeon, that repair takes\\nplace.\\n\\nIn applying the antiseptic principle to the treatment of wounds, our\\nmain object is to exclude or to eliminate the bacterial factor, and so\\nto prevent the inflammatory reaction going beyond the stage in which it\\nis protective, and just in proportion as we succeed in attaining this\\nobject, do we favour the occurrence of ideal repair.\\n\\n#Sequence of Changes in Bacterial Inflammation.#--As the form of\\ninflammation with which we are most concerned is that due to the action\\nof bacteria, in describing the process by which the protective influence\\nof the inflammatory reaction is brought into play, we shall assume the\\npresence of a bacterial irritant.\\n\\nThe introduction of a colony of micro-organisms is quickly followed by\\nan accumulation of wandering cells, and proliferation of\\nconnective-tissue cells in the tissues at the site of infection. The\\nvarious cells are attracted to the bacteria by a peculiar chemical or\\nbiological power known as _chemotaxis_, which seems to result from\\nvariations in the surface tension of different varieties of cells,\\nprobably caused by some substance produced by the micro-organisms.\\nChanges in the blood vessels then ensue, the arteries becoming dilated\\nand the rate of the current in them being for a time increased--_active\\nhyperaemia_. Soon, however, the rate of the blood flow becomes slower\\nthan normal, and in course of time the current may cease (_stasis_), and\\nthe blood in the vessels may even coagulate (_thrombosis_). Coincidently\\nwith these changes in the vessels, the leucocytes in the blood of the\\ninflamed part rapidly increase in number, and they become viscous and\\nadhere to the vessel wall, where they may accumulate in large numbers.\\nIn course of time the leucocytes pass through the vessel\\nwall--_emigration of leucocytes_--and move towards the seat of\\ninfection, giving rise to a marked degree of _local leucocytosis_.\\nThrough the openings by which the leucocytes have escaped from the\\nvessels, red corpuscles may be passively extruded--_diapedesis of red\\ncorpuscles_. These processes are accompanied by changes in the\\nendothelium of the vessel walls, which result in an increased formation\\nof lymph, which transudes into the meshes of the connective tissue\\ngiving rise to an _inflammatory oedema_, or, if the inflammation is on a\\nfree surface, forming an _inflammatory exudate_. The quantity and\\ncharacters of this exudate vary in different parts of the body, and\\naccording to the nature, virulence, and location of the organisms\\ncausing the inflammation. Thus it may be _serous_, as in some forms of\\nsynovitis; _sero-fibrinous_, as in certain varieties of peritonitis, the\\nfibrin tending to limit the spread of the inflammation by forming\\nadhesions; _croupous_, when it coagulates on a free surface and forms a\\nfalse membrane, as in diphtheria; _haemorrhagic_ when mixed with blood;\\nor _purulent_, when suppuration has occurred. The protective effects of\\nthe inflammatory reaction depend for the most part upon the transudation\\nof lymph and the emigration of leucocytes. The lymph contains the\\nopsonins which act on the bacteria and render them less able to resist\\nthe attack of the phagocytes, as well as the various protective\\nantibodies which neutralise the toxins. The polymorph leucocytes are the\\nprincipal agents in the process of phagocytosis (p. 22), and together\\nwith the other forms of phagocytes they ingest and destroy the bacteria.\\n\\nIf the attempt to repel the invading organisms is successful, the\\nirritant effects are overcome, the inflammation is arrested, and\\n_resolution_ is said to take place.\\n\\nCertain of the vascular and cellular changes are now utilised to restore\\nthe condition to the normal, and _repair_ ensues after the manner\\nalready described. In certain situations, notably in tendon sheaths, in\\nthe cavities of joints, and in the interior of serous cavities, for\\nexample the pleura and peritoneum, the restoration to the normal is not\\nperfect, adhesions forming between the opposing surfaces.\\n\\nIf, however, the reaction induced by the infection is insufficient to\\ncheck the growth and spread of the organisms, or to inhibit their toxin\\nproduction, local necrosis of tissue may take place, either in the form\\nof suppuration or of gangrene, or the toxins absorbed into the\\ncirculation may produce blood-poisoning, which may even prove fatal.\\n\\n#Clinical Aspects of Inflammation.#--It must clearly be understood that\\ninflammation is not to be looked upon as a disease in itself, but rather\\nas an evidence of some infective process going on in the tissues in\\nwhich it occurs, and of an effort on the part of these tissues to\\novercome the invading organisms and their products. The chief danger to\\nthe patient lies, not in the reactive changes that constitute the\\ninflammatory process, but in the fact that he is liable to be poisoned\\nby the toxins of the bacteria at work in the inflamed area.\\n\\nSince the days of Celsus (first century A.D.), heat, redness, swelling,\\nand pain have been recognised as cardinal signs of inflammation, and to\\nthese may be added, interference with function in the inflamed part, and\\ngeneral constitutional disturbance. Variations in these signs and\\nsymptoms depend upon the acuteness of the condition, the nature of the\\ncausative organism and of the tissue attacked, the situation of the part\\nin relation to the surface, and other factors.\\n\\nThe _heat_ of the inflamed part is to be attributed to the increased\\nquantity of blood present in it, and the more superficial the affected\\narea the more readily is the local increase of temperature detected by\\nthe hand. This clinical point is best tested by placing the palm of the\\nhand and fingers for a few seconds alternately over an uninflamed and an\\ninflamed area, otherwise under similar conditions as to coverings and\\nexposure. In this way even slight differences may be recognised.\\n\\n_Redness_, similarly, is due to the increased afflux of blood to the\\ninflamed part. The shade of colour varies with the stage of the\\ninflammation, being lighter and brighter in the early, hyperaemic stages,\\nand darker and duskier when the blood flow is slowed or when stasis has\\noccurred and the oxygenation of the blood is defective. In the\\nthrombotic stage the part may assume a purplish hue.\\n\\nThe _swelling_ is partly due to the increased amount of blood in the\\naffected part and to the accumulation of leucocytes and proliferated\\ntissue cells, but chiefly to the exudate in the connective\\ntissue--_inflammatory oedema_. The more open the structure of the tissue\\nof the part, the greater is the amount of swelling--witness the marked\\ndegree of oedema that occurs in such parts as the scrotum or the eyelids.\\n\\n_Pain_ is a symptom seldom absent in inflammation. _Tenderness_--that\\nis, pain elicited on pressure--is one of the most valuable diagnostic\\nsigns we possess, and is often present before pain is experienced by the\\npatient. That the area of tenderness corresponds to the area of\\ninflammation is almost an axiom of surgery. Pain and tenderness are due\\nto the irritation of nerve filaments of the part, rendered all the more\\nsensitive by the abnormal conditions of their blood supply. In\\ninflammatory conditions of internal organs, for example the abdominal\\nviscera, the pain is frequently referred to other parts, usually to an\\narea supplied by branches from the same segment of the cord as that\\nsupplying the inflamed part.\\n\\nFor purposes of diagnosis, attention should be paid to the terms in\\nwhich the patient describes his pain. For example, the pain caused by\\nan inflammation of the skin is usually described as of a _burning_ or\\n_itching_ character; that of inflammation in dense tissues like\\nperiosteum or bone, or in encapsuled organs, as _dull_, _boring_, or\\n_aching_. When inflammation is passing on to suppuration the pain\\nassumes a _throbbing_ character, and as the pus reaches the surface, or\\n\"points,\" as it is called, sharp, _darting_, or _lancinating_ pains are\\nexperienced. Inflammation involving a nerve-trunk may cause a _boring_\\nor a _tingling_ pain; while the implication of a serous membrane such as\\nthe pleura or peritoneum gives rise to a pain of a sharp, _stabbing_\\ncharacter.\\n\\n_Interference with the function_ of the inflamed part is always present\\nto a greater or less extent.\\n\\n#Constitutional Disturbances.#--Under the term constitutional\\ndisturbances are included the presence of fever or elevation of\\ntemperature; certain changes in the pulse rate and the respiration;\\ngastro-intestinal and urinary disturbances; and derangements of the\\ncentral nervous system. These are all due to the absorption of toxins\\ninto the general circulation.\\n\\n_Temperature._--A marked rise of temperature is one of the most constant\\nand important concomitants of acute inflammatory conditions, and the\\ntemperature chart forms a fairly reliable index of the state of the\\npatient. The toxins interfere with the nerve-centres in the medulla that\\nregulate the balance between the production and the loss of body heat.\\n\\nClinically the temperature is estimated by means of a self-registering\\nthermometer placed, for from one to five minutes, in close contact with\\nthe skin in the axilla, or in the mouth. Sometimes the thermometer is\\ninserted into the rectum, where, however, the temperature is normally\\n3/4 o F. higher than in the axilla.\\n\\n_In health_ the temperature of the body is maintained at a mean of about\\n98.4 o F. (37 o C.) by the heat-regulating mechanism. It varies from hour\\nto hour even in health, reaching its maximum between four and eight in\\nthe evening, when it may rise to 99 o F., and is at its lowest between\\nfour and six in the morning, when it may be about 97 o F.\\n\\nThe temperature is more easily disturbed in children than in adults, and\\nmay become markedly elevated (104 o or 105 o F.) from comparatively slight\\ncauses; in the aged it is less liable to change, so that a rise to 103 o\\nor 104 o F. is to be looked upon as indicating a high state of fever.\\n\\nA sudden rise of temperature is usually associated with a feeling of\\nchilliness down the back and in the limbs, which may be so marked that\\nthe patient shivers violently, while the skin becomes cold, pale, and\\nshrivelled--_cutis anserina_. This is a nervous reaction due to a want\\nof correspondence between the internal and the surface temperature of\\nthe body, and is known clinically as a _rigor_. When the temperature\\nrises gradually the chill is usually slight and may be unobserved. Even\\nduring the cold stage, however, the internal temperature is already\\nraised, and by the time the chill has passed off its maximum has been\\nreached.\\n\\nThe _pulse_ is always increased in frequency, and usually varies\\ndirectly with the height of the temperature. _Respiration_ is more\\nactive during the progress of an inflammation; and bronchial catarrh is\\ncommon apart from any antecedent respiratory disease.\\n\\n_Gastro-intestinal disturbances_ take the form of loss of appetite,\\nvomiting, diminished secretion of the alimentary juices, and weakening\\nof the peristalsis of the bowel, leading to thirst, dry, furred tongue,\\nand constipation. Diarrhoea is sometimes present. The _urine_ is usually\\nscanty, of high specific gravity, rich in nitrogenous substances,\\nespecially urea and uric acid, and in calcium salts, while sodium\\nchloride is deficient. Albumin and hyaline casts may be present in cases\\nof severe inflammation with high temperature. The significance of\\ngeneral _leucocytosis_ has already been referred to.\\n\\n#General Principles of Treatment.#--The capacity of the inflammatory\\nreaction for dealing with bacterial infections being limited, it often\\nbecomes necessary for the surgeon to aid the natural defensive\\nprocesses, as well as to counteract the local and general effects of the\\nreaction, and to relieve symptoms.\\n\\nThe ideal means of helping the tissues is by removing the focus of\\ninfection, and when this can be done, as for example in a carbuncle or\\nan anthrax pustule, the infected area may be completely excised. When\\nthe focus is not sufficiently limited to admit of this, the infected\\ntissue may be scraped away with the sharp spoon, or destroyed by\\ncaustics or by the actual cautery. If this is inadvisable, the organisms\\nmay be attacked by strong antiseptics, such as pure carbolic acid.\\n\\nMoist dressings favour the removal of bacteria by promoting the escape\\nof the inflammatory exudate, in which they are washed out.\\n\\n#Artificial Hyperaemia.#--When such direct means as the above are\\nimpracticable, much can be done to aid the tissues in their struggle by\\nimproving the condition of the circulation in the inflamed area, so as\\nto ensure that a plentiful supply of fresh arterial blood reaches it.\\nThe beneficial effects of _hot fomentations and poultices_ depend on\\ntheir causing a dilatation of the vessels, and so inducing a hyperaemia\\nin the affected area. It has been shown experimentally that repeated,\\nshort applications of moist heat (not exceeding 106 o F.) are more\\nefficacious than continuous application. It is now believed that the\\nso-called _counter-irritants_--mustard, iodine, cantharides, actual\\ncautery--act in the same way; and the method of treating erysipelas by\\napplying a strong solution of iodine around the affected area is based\\non the same principle.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Passive Hyperaemia of Hand and Forearm induced by\\nBier\\'s Bandage.]\\n\\nWhile these and similar methods have long been employed in the treatment\\nof inflammatory conditions, it is only within comparatively recent years\\nthat their mode of action has been properly understood, and to August\\nBier belongs the credit of having put the treatment of inflammation on a\\nscientific and rational basis. Recognising the \"beneficent intention\" of\\nthe inflammatory reaction, and the protective action of the leucocytosis\\nwhich accompanies the hyperaemic stages of the process, Bier was led to\\nstudy the effects of increasing the hyperaemia by artificial means. As a\\nresult of his observations, he has formulated a method of treatment\\nwhich consists in inducing an artificial hyperaemia in the inflamed area,\\neither by obstructing the venous return from the part (_passive\\nhyperaemia_), or by stimulating the arterial flow through it (_active\\nhyperaemia_).\\n\\n_Bier\\'s Constricting Bandage._--To induce a _passive hyperaemia_ in a\\nlimb, an elastic bandage is applied some distance above the inflamed\\narea sufficiently tightly to obstruct the venous return from the distal\\nparts without arresting in any way the inflow of arterial blood (Fig. 6).\\nIf the constricting band is correctly applied, the parts beyond\\nbecome swollen and oedematous, and assume a bluish-red hue, but they\\nretain their normal temperature, the pulse is unchanged, and there is no\\npain. If the part becomes blue, cold, or painful, or if any existing\\npain is increased, the band has been applied too tightly. The hyperaemia\\nis kept up from twenty to twenty-two hours out of the twenty-four, and\\nin the intervals the limb is elevated to get rid of the oedema and to\\nempty it of impure blood, and so make room for a fresh supply of healthy\\nblood when the bandage is re-applied. As the inflammation subsides, the\\nperiod during which the band is kept on each day is diminished; but the\\ntreatment should be continued for some days after all signs of\\ninflammation have subsided.\\n\\nThis method of treating acute inflammatory conditions necessitates\\nclose supervision until the correct degree of tightness of the band has\\nbeen determined.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Passive Hyperaemia of Finger induced by Klapp\\'s\\nSuction Bell.]\\n\\n_Klapp\\'s Suction Bells._--In inflammatory conditions to which the\\nconstricting band cannot be applied, as for example an acute mastitis, a\\nbubo in the groin, or a boil on the neck, the affected area may be\\nrendered hyperaemic by an appropriately shaped glass bell applied over it\\nand exhausted by means of a suction-pump, the rarefaction of the air in\\nthe bell determining a flow of blood into the tissues enclosed within it\\n(Figs. 7 and 8). The edge of the bell is smeared with vaseline, and the\\nsuction applied for from five to ten minutes at a time, with a\\ncorresponding interval between the applications. Each sitting lasts for\\nfrom half an hour to an hour, and the treatment may be carried out once\\nor twice a day according to circumstances. This apparatus acts in the\\nsame way as the old-fashioned _dry cup_, and is more convenient and\\nequally efficacious.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Passive Hyperaemia induced by Klapp\\'s Suction\\nBell for Inflammation of Inguinal Gland.]\\n\\n_Active hyperaemia_ is induced by the local application of heat,\\nparticularly by means of hot air. It has not proved so useful in acute\\ninflammation as passive hyperaemia, but is of great value in hastening\\nthe absorption of inflammatory products and in overcoming adhesions and\\nstiffness in tendons and joints.\\n\\n_General Treatment._--The patient should be kept at rest, preferably in\\nbed, to diminish the general tissue waste; and the diet should be\\nrestricted to fluids, such as milk, beef-tea, meat juices or gruel, and\\nthese may be rendered more easily assimilable by artificial digestion if\\nnecessary. To counteract the general effect of toxins absorbed into\\nthe circulation, specific antitoxic sera are employed in certain forms\\nof infection, such as diphtheria, streptococcal septicaemia, and tetanus.\\nIn other forms of infection, vaccines are employed to increase the\\nopsonic power of the blood. When such means are not available, the\\ncirculating toxins may to some extent be diluted by giving plenty of\\nbland fluids by the mouth or normal salt solution by the rectum.\\n\\nThe elimination of the toxins is promoted by securing free action of the\\nemunctories. A saline purge, such as half an ounce of sulphate of\\nmagnesium in a small quantity of water, ensures a free evacuation of the\\nbowels. The kidneys are flushed by such diluent drinks as equal parts of\\nmilk and lime water, or milk with a dram of liquor calcis saccharatus\\nadded to each tumblerful. Barley-water and \"Imperial drink,\" which\\nconsists of a dram and a half of cream of tartar added to a pint of\\nboiling water and sweetened with sugar after cooling, are also useful\\nand non-irritating diuretics. The skin may be stimulated by Dover\\'s\\npowder (10 grains) or liquor ammoniae acetatis in three-dram doses every\\nfour hours.\\n\\nVarious drugs administered internally, such as quinine, salol,\\nsalicylate of iron, and others, have a reputation, more or less\\ndeserved, as internal antiseptics.\\n\\nWeakness of the heart, as indicated by the condition of the pulse, is\\ntreated by the use of such drugs as digitalis, strophanthus, or\\nstrychnin, according to circumstances.\\n\\nGastro-intestinal disturbances are met by ordinary medical means.\\nVomiting, for example, can sometimes be checked by effervescing drinks,\\nsuch as citrate of caffein, or by dilute hydrocyanic acid and bismuth.\\nIn severe cases, and especially when the vomited matter resembles\\ncoffee-grounds from admixture with altered blood--the so-called\\npost-operative haematemesis--the best means of arresting the vomiting is\\nby washing out the stomach. Thirst is relieved by rectal injections of\\nsaline solution. The introduction of saline solution into the veins or\\nby the rectum is also useful in diluting and hastening the elimination\\nof circulating toxins.\\n\\nIn surgical inflammations, as a rule, nothing is gained by lowering the\\ntemperature, unless at the same time the cause is removed. When severe\\nor prolonged pyrexia becomes a source of danger, the use of hot or cold\\nsponging, or even the cold bath, is preferable to the administration of\\ndrugs.\\n\\n_Relief of Symptoms._--For the relief of _pain_, rest is essential. The\\ninflamed part should be placed in a splint or other appliance which will\\nprevent movement, and steps must be taken to reduce its functional\\nactivity as far as possible. Locally, warm and moist dressings, such as\\na poultice or fomentation, may be used. To make a fomentation, a piece\\nof flannel or lint is wrung out of very hot water or antiseptic lotion\\nand applied under a sheet of mackintosh. Fomentations should be renewed\\nas often as they cool. An ordinary india-rubber bag filled with hot\\nwater and fixed over the fomentation, by retaining the heat, obviates\\nthe necessity of frequently changing the application. The addition of a\\nfew drops of laudanum sprinkled on the flannel has a soothing effect.\\nLead and opium lotion is a useful, soothing application employed as a\\nfomentation. We prefer the application of lint soaked in a 10 per cent.\\naqueous or glycerine solution of ichthyol, or smeared with ichthyol\\nointment (1 in 3). Belladonna and glycerine, equal parts, may be used.\\n\\nDry cold obtained by means of icebags, or by Leiter\\'s lead tubes through\\nwhich a continuous stream of ice-cold water is kept flowing, is\\nsometimes soothing to the patient, but when the vessels in the inflamed\\npart are greatly congested its use is attended with considerable risk,\\nas it not only contracts the arterioles supplying the part, but also\\ndiminishes the outflow of venous blood, and so may determine gangrene of\\ntissues already devitalised.\\n\\nA milder form of employing cold is by means of evaporating lotions: a\\nthin piece of lint or gauze is applied over the inflamed part and kept\\nconstantly moist with the lotion, the dressing being left freely exposed\\nto allow of continuous evaporation. A useful evaporating lotion is made\\nup as follows: take of chloride of ammonium, half an ounce; rectified\\nspirit, one ounce; and water, seven ounces.\\n\\nThe administration of opiates may be necessary for the relief of pain.\\n\\nThe accumulation of an excessive amount of inflammatory exudate may\\nendanger the vitality of the tissues by pressing on the blood vessels to\\nsuch an extent as to cause stasis, and by concentrating the local action\\nof the toxins. Under such conditions the tension should be relieved and\\nthe exudate with its contained toxins removed by making an incision into\\nthe inflamed tissues, and applying a suction bell. When the exudate has\\ncollected in a synovial cavity, such as a joint or bursa, it may be\\nwithdrawn by means of a trocar and cannula. There are other methods of\\nwithdrawing blood and exudate from an inflamed area, for example by\\nleeches or wet-cupping, but they are seldom employed now.\\n\\nBefore applying leeches the part must be thoroughly cleansed, and if\\nthe leech is slow to bite, may be smeared with cream. The leech is\\nretained in position under an inverted wine-glass or wide test-tube till\\nit takes hold. After it has sucked its fill it usually drops off, having\\nwithdrawn a dram or a dram and a half of blood. If it be desirable to\\nwithdraw more blood, hot fomentations should be applied to the bite. As\\nit is sometimes necessary to employ considerable pressure to stop the\\nbleeding, leeches should, if possible, be applied over a bone which will\\nfurnish the necessary resistance. The use of styptics may be called for.\\n\\n_Wet-cupping_ has almost entirely been superseded by the use of Klapp\\'s\\nsuction bells.\\n\\n_General blood-letting_ consists in opening a superficial vein\\n(venesection) and allowing from eight to ten ounces of blood to flow\\nfrom it. It is seldom used in the treatment of surgical forms of\\ninflammation.\\n\\n_Counter-irritants._--In deep-seated inflammations, counter-irritants\\nare sometimes employed in the form of mustard leaves or blisters,\\naccording to the degree of irritation required. A mustard leaf or\\nplaster should not be left on longer than ten or fifteen minutes, unless\\nit is desired to produce a blister. Blistering may be produced by a\\n_cantharides plaster_, or by painting with _liquor epispasticus_. The\\nplaster should be left on from eight to ten hours, and if it has failed\\nto raise a blister, a hot fomentation should be applied to the part.\\n_Liquor epispasticus_, alone or mixed with equal parts of collodion, is\\npainted on the part with a brush. Several paintings are often required\\nbefore a blister is raised. The preliminary removal of the natural\\ngrease from the skin favours the action of these applications.\\n\\nThe treatment of inflammation in special tissues and organs will be\\nconsidered in the sections devoted to regional surgery.\\n\\n#Chronic Inflammation.#--A variety of types of chronic and subacute\\ninflammation are met with which, owing to ignorance of their causations,\\ncannot at present be satisfactorily classified.\\n\\nThe best defined group is that of the _granulomata_, which includes such\\nimportant diseases as tuberculosis and syphilis, and in which different\\ntypes of chronic inflammation are caused by infection with a specific\\norganism, all having the common character, however, that abundant\\ngranulation tissue is formed in which cellular changes are more in\\nevidence than changes in the blood vessels, and in which the subsequent\\ndegeneration and necrosis of the granulation tissue results in the\\nbreaking down and destruction of the tissue in which it is formed.\\nAnother group is that in which chronic inflammation is due to mild or\\nattenuated forms of pyogenic infection affecting especially the lymph\\nglands and the bone marrow. In the glands of the groin, for example,\\nassociated with various forms of irritation about the external genitals,\\ndifferent types of _chronic lymphadenitis_ are met with; they do not\\nfrankly suppurate as do the acute types, but are attended with a\\nhyperplasia of the tissue elements which results in enlargement of the\\naffected glands of a persistent, and sometimes of a relapsing character.\\nSimilar varieties of _osteomyelitis_ are met with that do not, like the\\nacute forms, go on to suppuration or to death of bone, but result in\\nthickening of the bone affected, both on the surface and in the\\ninterior, resulting in obliteration of the medullary canal.\\n\\nA third group of chronic inflammations are those that begin as an acute\\npyogenic inflammation, which, instead of resolving completely, persists\\nin a chronic form. It does so apparently because there is some factor\\naiding the organisms and handicapping the tissues, such as the presence\\nof a foreign body, a piece of glass or metal, or a piece of dead bone;\\nin these circumstances the inflammation persists in a chronic form,\\nattended with the formation of fibrous tissue, and, in the case of bone,\\nwith the formation of new bone in excess. It will be evident that in\\nthis group, chronic inflammation and repair are practically\\ninterchangeable terms.\\n\\nThere are other groups of chronic inflammation, the origin of which\\ncontinues to be the subject of controversy. Reference is here made to\\nthe chronic inflammations of the synovial membrane of joints, of tendon\\nsheaths and of bursae--_chronic synovitis_, _teno-synovitis_ and\\n_bursitis_; of the fibrous tissues of joints--chronic forms of\\n_arthritis_; of the blood vessels--chronic forms of _endarteritis_ and\\nof _phlebitis_ and of the peripheral nerves--_neuritis_. Also in the\\nbreast and in the prostate, with the waning of sexual life there may\\noccur a formation of fibrous tissue--chronic _interstitial mastitis_,\\n_chronic prostatitis_, having analogies with the chronic interstitial\\ninflammations of internal organs like the kidney--_chronic interstitial\\nnephritis_; and in the breast and prostate, as in the kidney, the\\nformation of fibrous tissue leads to changes in the secreting epithelium\\nresulting in the formation of cysts.\\n\\nLastly, there are still other types of chronic inflammation attended\\nwith the formation of fibrous tissue on such a liberal scale as to\\nsuggest analogies with new growths. The best known of these are the\\nsystematic forms of fibromatosis met with in the central nervous system\\nand in the peripheral nerves--_neuro-fibromatosis_; in the submucous\\ncoat of the stomach--_gastric fibromatosis_; and in the\\ncolon--_intestinal fibromatosis_.\\n\\nThese conditions will be described with the tissues and organs in which\\nthey occur.\\n\\nIn the _treatment of chronic inflammations_, pending further knowledge\\nas to their causation, and beyond such obvious indications as to help\\nthe tissues by removing a foreign body or a piece of dead bone, there\\nare employed--empirically--a number of procedures such as the induction\\nof hyperaemia, exposure to the X-rays, and the employment of blisters,\\ncauteries, and setons. Vaccines may be had recourse to in those of\\nbacterial origin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nSUPPURATION\\n\\n\\nDefinition--Pus--_Varieties_--Acute circumscribed abscess--_Acute\\n    suppuration in a wound_--_Acute Suppuration in a mucous\\n    membrane_--Diffuse cellulitis and diffuse suppuration--\\n    _Whitlow_--_Suppurative cellulitis in different situations_--Chronic\\n    suppuration--Sinus, Fistula--Constitutional manifestations of\\n    pyogenic infection--_Sapraemia_--_Septicaemia_--_Pyaemia_.\\n\\nSuppuration, or the formation of pus, is one of the results of the\\naction of bacteria on the tissues. The invading organism is usually one\\nof the staphylococci, less frequently a streptococcus, and still less\\nfrequently one of the other bacteria capable of producing pus, such as\\nthe bacillus coli communis, the gonococcus, the pneumococcus, or the\\ntyphoid bacillus.\\n\\nSo long as the tissues are in a healthy condition they are able to\\nwithstand the attacks of moderate numbers of pyogenic bacteria of\\nordinary virulence, but when devitalised by disease, by injury, or by\\ninflammation due to the action of other pathogenic organisms,\\nsuppuration ensues.\\n\\nIt would appear, for example, that pyogenic organisms can pass through\\nthe healthy urinary tract without doing any damage, but if the pelvis of\\nthe kidney, the ureter, or the bladder is the seat of stone, they give\\nrise to suppuration. Similarly, a calculus in one of the salivary ducts\\nfrequently results in an abscess forming in the floor of the mouth. When\\nthe lumen of a tubular organ, such as the appendix or the Fallopian tube\\nis blocked also, the action of pyogenic organisms is favoured and\\nsuppuration ensues.\\n\\n#Pus.#--The fluid resulting from the process of suppuration is known\\nas _pus_. In its typical form it is a yellowish creamy substance, of\\nalkaline reaction, with a specific gravity of about 1030, and it has a\\npeculiar mawkish odour. If allowed to stand in a test-tube it does not\\ncoagulate, but separates into two layers: the upper, transparent,\\nstraw-coloured fluid, the _liquor puris_ or pus serum, closely\\nresembling blood serum in its composition, but containing less protein\\nand more cholestrol; it also contains leucin, tyrosin, and certain\\nalbumoses which prevent coagulation.\\n\\nThe layer at the bottom of the tube consists for the most part of\\npolymorph leucocytes, and proliferated connective tissue and endothelial\\ncells (_pus corpuscles_). Other forms of leucocytes may be present,\\nespecially in long-standing suppurations; and there are usually some red\\ncorpuscles, dead bacteria, fat cells and shreds of tissue, cholestrol\\ncrystals, and other detritus in the deposit.\\n\\nIf a film of fresh pus is examined under the microscope, the pus cells\\nare seen to have a well-defined rounded outline, and to contain a finely\\ngranular protoplasm and a multi-partite nucleus; if still warm, the\\ncells may exhibit amoeboid movement. In stained films the nuclei take the\\nstain well. In older pus cells the outline is irregular, the protoplasm\\ncoarsely granular, and the nuclei disintegrated, no longer taking the\\nstain.\\n\\n_Variations from Typical Pus._--Pus from old-standing sinuses is often\\nwatery in consistence (ichorous), with few cells. Where the granulations\\nare vascular and bleed easily, it becomes sanious from admixture with\\nred corpuscles; while, if a blood-clot be broken down and the debris\\nmixed with the pus, it contains granules of blood pigment and is said to\\nbe \"grumous.\" The _odour_ of pus varies with the different bacteria\\nproducing it. Pus due to ordinary pyogenic cocci has a mawkish odour;\\nwhen putrefactive organisms are present it has a putrid odour; when it\\nforms in the vicinity of the intestinal canal it usually contains the\\nbacillus coli communis and has a faecal odour.\\n\\nThe _colour_ of pus also varies: when due to one or other of the\\nvarieties of the bacillus pyocyaneus, it is usually of a blue or green\\ncolour; when mixed with bile derivatives or altered blood pigment, it\\nmay be of a bright orange colour. In wounds inflicted with rough iron\\nimplements from which rust is deposited, the pus often presents the same\\ncolour.\\n\\nThe pus may form and collect within a circumscribed area, constituting a\\nlocalised _abscess_; or it may infiltrate the tissues over a wide\\narea--_diffuse suppuration_.\\n\\n\\nACUTE CIRCUMSCRIBED ABSCESS\\n\\nAny tissue of the body may be the seat of an acute abscess, and there\\nare many routes by which the bacteria may gain access to the affected\\narea. For example: an abscess in the integument or subcutaneous\\ncellular tissue usually results from infection by organisms which have\\nentered through a wound or abrasion of the surface, or along the ducts\\nof the skin; an abscess in the breast from organisms which have passed\\nalong the milk ducts opening on the nipple, or along the lymphatics\\nwhich accompany these. An abscess in a lymph gland is usually due to\\ninfection passing by way of the lymph channels from the area of skin or\\nmucous membrane drained by them. Abscesses in internal organs, such as\\nthe kidney, liver, or brain, usually result from organisms carried in\\nthe blood-stream from some focus of infection elsewhere in the body.\\n\\nA knowledge of the possible avenues of infection is of clinical\\nimportance, as it may enable the source of a given abscess to be traced\\nand dealt with. In suppuration in the Fallopian tube (pyosalpynx), for\\nexample, the fact that the most common origin of the infection is in the\\ngenital passage, leads to examination for vaginal discharge; and if none\\nis present, the abscess is probably due to infection carried in the\\nblood-stream from some primary focus about the mouth, such as a gumboil\\nor an infective sore throat.\\n\\nThe exact location of an abscess also may furnish a key to its source;\\nin axillary abscess, for example, if the suppuration is in the lymph\\nglands the infection has come through the afferent lymphatics; if in the\\ncellular tissue, it has spread from the neck or chest wall; if in the\\nhair follicles, it is a local infection through the skin.\\n\\n#Formation of an Abscess.#--When pyogenic bacteria are introduced into\\nthe tissue there ensues an inflammatory reaction, which is characterised\\nby dilatation of the blood vessels, exudation of large numbers of\\nleucocytes, and proliferation of connective-tissue cells. These\\nwandering cells soon accumulate round the focus of infection, and form a\\nprotective barrier which tends to prevent the spread of the organisms\\nand to restrict their field of action. Within the area thus\\ncircumscribed the struggle between the bacteria and the phagocytes takes\\nplace, and in the process toxins are formed by the organisms, a certain\\nnumber of the leucocytes succumb, and, becoming degenerated, set free\\ncertain proteolytic enzymes or ferments. The toxins cause\\ncoagulation-necrosis of the tissue cells with which they come in\\ncontact, the ferments liquefy the exudate and other albuminous\\nsubstances, and in this way _pus_ is formed.\\n\\nIf the bacteria gain the upper hand, this process of liquefaction which\\nis characteristic of suppuration, extends into the surrounding tissues,\\nthe protective barrier of leucocytes is broken down, and the\\nsuppurative process spreads. A fresh accession of leucocytes, however,\\nforms a new barrier, and eventually the spread is arrested, and the\\ncollection of pus so hemmed in constitutes an _abscess_.\\n\\nOwing to the swelling and condensation of the parts around, the pus thus\\nformed is under considerable pressure, and this causes it to burrow\\nalong the lines of least resistance. In the case of a subcutaneous\\nabscess the pus usually works its way towards the surface, and \"points,\"\\nas it is called. Where it approaches the surface the skin becomes soft\\nand thin, and eventually sloughs, allowing the pus to escape.\\n\\nAn abscess forming in the deeper planes is prevented from pointing\\ndirectly to the surface by the firm fasciae and other fibrous structures.\\nThe pus therefore tends to burrow along the line of the blood vessels\\nand in the connective-tissue septa, till it either finds a weak spot or\\ncauses a portion of fascia to undergo necrosis and so reaches the\\nsurface. Accordingly, many abscess cavities resulting from deep-seated\\nsuppuration are of irregular shape, with pouches and loculi in various\\ndirections--an arrangement which interferes with their successful\\ntreatment by incision and drainage.\\n\\nThe relief of tension which follows the bursting of an abscess, the\\nremoval of irritation by the escape of pus, and the casting off of\\nbacteria and toxins, allow the tissues once more to assert themselves,\\nand a process of repair sets in. The walls of the abscess fall in;\\ngranulation tissue grows into the space and gradually fills it; and\\nlater this is replaced by cicatricial tissue. As a result of the\\nsubsequent contraction of the cicatricial tissue, the scar is usually\\ndepressed below the level of the surrounding skin surface.\\n\\nIf an abscess is prevented from healing--for example, by the presence of\\na foreign body or a piece of necrosed bone--a sinus results, and from it\\npus escapes until the foreign body is removed.\\n\\n#Clinical Features of an Acute Circumscribed Abscess.#--In the initial\\nstages the usual symptoms of inflammation are present. Increased\\nelevation of temperature, with or without a rigor, progressive\\nleucocytosis, and sweating, mark the transition between inflammation and\\nsuppuration. An increasing leucocytosis is evidence that a suppurative\\nprocess is spreading.\\n\\nThe local symptoms vary with the seat of the abscess. When it is\\nsituated superficially--for example, in the breast tissue--the affected\\narea is hot, the redness of inflammation gives place to a dusky purple\\ncolour, with a pale, sometimes yellow, spot where the pus is near the\\nsurface. The swelling increases in size, the firm brawny centre becomes\\nsoft, projects as a cone beyond the level of the rest of the swollen\\narea, and is usually surrounded by a zone of induration.\\n\\nBy gently palpating with the finger-tips over the softened area, a fluid\\nwave may be detected--_fluctuation_--and when present this is a certain\\nindication of the existence of fluid in the swelling. Its recognition,\\nhowever, is by no means easy, and various fallacies are to be guarded\\nagainst in applying this test clinically. When, for example, the walls\\nof the abscess are thick and rigid, or when its contents are under\\nexcessive tension, the fluid wave cannot be elicited. On the other hand,\\na sensation closely resembling fluctuation may often be recognised in\\noedematous tissues, in certain soft, solid tumours such as fatty tumours\\nor vascular sarcomata, in aneurysm, and in a muscle when it is palpated\\nin its transverse axis.\\n\\nWhen pus has formed in deeper parts, and before it has reached the\\nsurface, oedema of the overlying skin is frequently present, and the skin\\npits on pressure.\\n\\nWith the formation of pus the continuous burning or boring pain of\\ninflammation assumes a throbbing character, with occasional sharp,\\nlancinating twinges. Should doubt remain as to the presence of pus,\\nrecourse may be had to the use of an exploring needle.\\n\\n_Differential Diagnosis of Acute Abscess._--A practical difficulty which\\nfrequently arises is to decide whether or not pus has actually formed.\\nIt may be accepted as a working rule in practice that when an acute\\ninflammation has lasted for four or five days without showing signs of\\nabatement, suppuration has almost certainly occurred. In deep-seated\\nsuppuration, marked oedema of the skin and the occurrence of rigors and\\nsweating may be taken to indicate the formation of pus.\\n\\nThere are cases on record where rapidly growing sarcomatous and\\nangiomatous tumours, aneurysms, and the bruises that occur in\\nhaemophylics, have been mistaken for acute abscesses and incised, with\\ndisastrous results.\\n\\n#Treatment of Acute Abscesses.#--The dictum of John Bell, \"Where there\\nis pus, let it out,\" summarises the treatment of abscess. The extent and\\nsituation of the incision and the means taken to drain the cavity,\\nhowever, vary with the nature, site, and relations of the abscess. In a\\nsuperficial abscess, for example a bubo, or an abscess in the breast or\\nface where a disfiguring scar is undesirable, a small puncture should be\\nmade where the pus threatens to point, and a Klapp\\'s suction bell be\\napplied as already described (p. 39). A drain is not necessary, and in\\nthe intervals between the applications of the bell the part is covered\\nwith a moist antiseptic dressing.\\n\\nIn abscesses deeply placed, as for example under the gluteal or pectoral\\nmuscles, one or more incisions should be made, and the cavity drained by\\nglass or rubber tubes or by strips of rubber tissue.\\n\\nThe wound should be dressed the next day, and the tube shortened, in the\\ncase of a rubber tube, by cutting off a portion of its outer end. On the\\nsecond day or later, according to circumstances, the tube is removed,\\nand after this the dressing need not be repeated oftener than every\\nsecond or third day.\\n\\nWhere pus has formed in relation to important structures--as, for\\nexample, in the deeper planes of the neck--_Hilton\\'s method_ of opening\\nthe abscess may be employed. An incision is made through the skin and\\nfascia, a grooved director is gently pushed through the deeper tissues\\ntill pus escapes along its groove, and then the track is widened by\\npassing in a pair of dressing forceps and expanding the blades. A tube,\\nor strip of rubber tissue, is introduced, and the subsequent treatment\\ncarried out as in other abscesses. When the drain lies in proximity to a\\nlarge blood vessel, care must be taken not to leave it in position long\\nenough to cause ulceration of the vessel wall by pressure.\\n\\nIn some abscesses, such as those in the vicinity of the anus, the cavity\\nshould be laid freely open in its whole extent, stuffed with iodoform or\\nbismuth gauze, and treated by the open method.\\n\\nIt is seldom advisable to wash out an abscess cavity, and squeezing out\\nthe pus is also to be avoided, lest the protective zone be broken down\\nand the infection be diffused into the surrounding tissues.\\n\\nThe importance of taking precautions against further infection in\\nopening an abscess can scarcely be exaggerated, and the rapidity with\\nwhich healing occurs when the access of fresh bacteria is prevented is\\nin marked contrast to what occurs when such precautions are neglected\\nand further infection is allowed to take place.\\n\\n_Acute Suppuration in a Wound._--If in the course of an operation\\ninfection of the wound has occurred, a marked inflammatory reaction soon\\nmanifests itself, and the same changes as occur in the formation of an\\nacute abscess take place, modified, however, by the fact that the pus\\ncan more readily reach the surface. In from twenty-four to forty-eight\\nhours the patient is conscious of a sensation of chilliness, or may\\neven have a rigor. At the same time he feels generally out of sorts,\\nwith impaired appetite, headache, and it may be looseness of the bowels.\\nHis temperature rises to 100 o or 101 o F., and the pulse quickens to 100\\nor 110.\\n\\nOn exposing the wound it is found that the parts for some distance\\naround are red, glazed, and oedematous. The discoloration and swelling\\nare most intense in the immediate vicinity of the wound, the edges of\\nwhich are everted and moist. Any stitches that may have been introduced\\nare tight, and the deep ones may be cutting into the tissues. There is\\nheat, and a constant burning or throbbing pain, which is increased by\\npressure. If the stitches be cut, pus escapes, the wound gapes, and its\\nsurfaces are found to be inflamed and covered with pus.\\n\\nThe open method is the only safe means of treating such wounds. The\\ninfected surface may be sponged over with pure carbolic acid, the excess\\nof which is washed off with absolute alcohol, and the wound either\\ndrained by tubes or packed with iodoform gauze. The practice of scraping\\nsuch surfaces with the sharp spoon, squeezing or even of washing them\\nout with antiseptic lotions, is attended with the risk of further\\ndiffusing the organisms in the tissue, and is only to be employed under\\nexceptional circumstances. Continuous irrigation of infected wounds or\\ntheir immersion in antiseptic baths is sometimes useful. The free\\nopening up of the wound is almost immediately followed by a fall in the\\ntemperature. The surrounding inflammation subsides, the discharge of pus\\nlessens, and healing takes place by the formation of granulation\\ntissue--the so-called \"healing by second intention.\"\\n\\nWound infection may take place from _catgut_ which has not been\\nefficiently prepared. The local and general reactions may be slight,\\nand, as a rule, do not appear for seven or eight days after the\\noperation, and, it may be, not till after the skin edges have united.\\nThe suppuration is strictly localised to the part of the wound where\\ncatgut was employed for stitches or ligatures, and shows little tendency\\nto spread. The infected part, however, is often long of healing. The\\nirritation in these cases is probably due to toxins in the catgut and\\nnot to bacteria.\\n\\nWhen suppuration occurs in connection with buried sutures of\\nunabsorbable materials, such as silk, silkworm gut, or silver wire, it\\nis apt to persist till the foreign material is cast off or removed.\\n\\nSuppuration may occur in the track of a skin stitch, producing a _stitch\\nabscess_. The infection may arise from the material used, especially\\ncatgut or silk, or, more frequently perhaps, from the growth of\\nstaphylococcus albus from the skin of the patient when this has been\\nimperfectly disinfected. The formation of pus under these conditions may\\nnot be attended with any of the usual signs of suppuration, and beyond\\nsome induration around the wound and a slight tenderness on pressure\\nthere may be nothing to suggest the presence of an abscess.\\n\\n_Acute Suppuration of a Mucous Membrane._--When pyogenic organisms gain\\naccess to a mucous membrane, such as that of the bladder, urethra, or\\nmiddle ear, the usual phenomena of acute inflammation and suppuration\\nensue, followed by the discharge of pus on the free surface. It would\\nappear that the most marked changes take place in the submucous tissue,\\ncausing the covering epithelium in places to die and leave small\\nsuperficial ulcers, for example in gonorrhoeal urethritis, the\\ncicatricial contraction of the scar subsequently leading to the\\nformation of stricture. When mucous glands are present in the membrane,\\nthe pus is mixed with mucus--_muco-pus_.\\n\\n\\nDIFFUSE CELLULITIS AND DIFFUSE SUPPURATION\\n\\nCellulitis is an acute affection resulting from the introduction of some\\norganism--commonly the _streptococcus pyogenes_--into the cellular\\nconnective tissue of the integument, intermuscular septa, tendon\\nsheaths, or other structures. Infection always takes place through a\\nbreach of the surface, although this may be superficial and\\ninsignificant, such as a pin-prick, a scratch, or a crack under a nail,\\nand the wound may have been healed for some time before the inflammation\\nbecomes manifest. The cellulitis, also, may develop at some distance\\nfrom the seat of inoculation, the organisms having travelled by the\\nlymphatics.\\n\\nThe virulence of the organisms, the loose, open nature of the tissues in\\nwhich they develop, and the free lymphatic circulation by means of which\\nthey are spread, account for the diffuse nature of the process.\\nSometimes numbers of cocci are carried for a considerable distance from\\nthe primary area before they are arrested in the lymphatics, and thus\\nseveral patches of inflammation may appear with healthy areas between.\\n\\nThe pus infiltrates the meshes of the cellular tissue, there is\\nsloughing of considerable portions of tissue of low vitality, such as\\nfat, fascia, or tendon, and if the process continues for some time\\nseveral collections of pus may form.\\n\\n_Clinical Features._--The reaction in cases of diffuse cellulitis is\\nsevere, and is usually ushered in by a distinct chill or even a rigor,\\nwhile the temperature rises to 103 o, 104 o, or 105 o F. The pulse is\\nproportionately increased in frequency, and is small, feeble, and often\\nirregular. The face is flushed, the tongue dry and brown, and the\\npatient may become delirious, especially during the night. Leucocytosis\\nis present in cases of moderate severity; but in severe cases the\\nvirulence of the toxins prevents reaction taking place, and leucocytosis\\nis absent.\\n\\nThe local manifestations vary with the relation of the seat of the\\ninflammation to the surface. When the superficial cellular tissue is\\ninvolved, the skin assumes a dark bluish-red colour, is swollen,\\noedematous, and the seat of burning pain. To the touch it is firm, hot,\\nand tender. When the primary focus is in the deeper tissues, the\\nconstitutional disturbance is aggravated, while the local signs are\\ndelayed, and only become prominent when pus forms and approaches the\\nsurface. It is not uncommon for blebs containing dark serous fluid to\\nform on the skin. The infection frequently spreads along the line of the\\nmain lymph vessels of the part (_septic lymphangitis_) and may reach the\\nlymph glands (_septic lymphadenitis_).\\n\\nWith the formation of pus the skin becomes soft and boggy at several\\npoints, and eventually breaks, giving exit to a quantity of thick\\ngrumous discharge. Sometimes several small collections under the skin\\nfuse, and an abscess is formed in which fluctuation can be detected.\\nOccasionally gases are evolved in the tissues, giving rise to emphysema.\\nIt is common for portions of fascia, ligaments, or tendons to slough,\\nand this may often be recognised clinically by a peculiar crunching or\\ngrating sensation transmitted to the fingers on making firm pressure on\\nthe part.\\n\\nIf it is not let out by incision, the pus, travelling along the lines of\\nleast resistance, tends to point at several places on the surface, or to\\nopen into joints or other cavities.\\n\\n_Prognosis._--The occurrence of _septicaemia_ is the most serious risk,\\nand it is in cases of diffuse suppurative cellulitis that this form of\\nblood-poisoning assumes its most aggravated forms. The toxins of the\\nstreptococci are exceedingly virulent, and induce local death of tissue\\nso rapidly that the protective emigration of leucocytes fails to take\\nplace. In some cases the passage of masses of free cocci in the\\nlymphatics, or of infective emboli in the blood vessels, leads to the\\nformation of _pyogenic abscesses_ in vital organs, such as the brain,\\nlungs, liver, kidneys, or other viscera. _Haemorrhage_ from erosion of\\narterial or venous trunks may take place and endanger life.\\n\\n_Treatment._--The treatment of diffuse cellulitis depends to a large\\nextent on the situation and extent of the affected area, and on the\\nstage of the process.\\n\\n_In the limbs_, for example, where the application of a constricting\\nband is practicable, Bier\\'s method of inducing passive hyperaemia yields\\nexcellent results. If pus is formed, one or more small incisions are\\nmade and a light moist dressing placed over the wounds to absorb the\\ndischarge, but no drain is inserted. The whole of the inflamed area\\nshould be covered with gauze wrung out of a 1 in 10 solution of ichthyol\\nin glycerine. The dressing is changed as often as necessary, and in the\\nintervals when the band is off, gentle active and passive movements\\nshould be carried out to prevent the formation of adhesions. After\\nincisions have been made, we have found the _immersion_ of the limb, for\\na few hours at a time, in a water-bath containing warm boracic lotion or\\neusol a useful adjuvant to the passive hyperaemia.\\n\\n_Continuous irrigation_ of the part by a slow, steady stream of lotion,\\nat the body temperature, such as eusol, or Dakin\\'s solution, or boracic\\nacid, or frequent washing with peroxide of hydrogen, has been found of\\nvalue.\\n\\nA suitably arranged splint adds to the comfort of the patient; and the\\nlimb should be placed in the attitude which, in the event of stiffness\\nresulting, will least interfere with its usefulness. The elbow, for\\nexample, should be flexed to a little less than a right angle; at the\\nwrist, the hand should be dorsiflexed and the fingers flexed slightly\\ntowards the palm.\\n\\nMassage, passive movement, hot and cold douching, and other measures,\\nmay be necessary to get rid of the chronic oedema, adhesions of tendons,\\nand stiffness of joints which sometimes remain.\\n\\nIn situations where a constricting band cannot be applied, for example,\\non the trunk or the neck, Klapp\\'s suction bells may be used, small\\nincisions being made to admit of the escape of pus.\\n\\nIf these measures fail or are impracticable, it may be necessary to make\\none or more free incisions, and to insert drainage-tubes, portions of\\nrubber dam, or iodoform worsted.\\n\\nThe general treatment of toxaemia must be carried out, and in cases due\\nto infection by streptococci, anti-streptococcic serum may be used.\\n\\nIn a few cases, amputation well above the seat of disease, by removing\\nthe source of toxin production, offers the only means of saving the\\npatient.\\n\\n\\nWHITLOW\\n\\nThe clinical term whitlow is applied to an acute infection, usually\\nfollowed by suppuration, commonly met with in the fingers, less\\nfrequently in the toes. The point of infection is often trivial--a\\npin-prick, a puncture caused by a splinter of wood, a scratch, or even\\nan imperceptible lesion of the skin.\\n\\nSeveral varieties of whitlow are recognised, but while it is convenient\\nto describe them separately, it is to be clearly understood that\\nclinically they merge one into another, and it is not always possible to\\ndetermine in which connective-tissue plane a given infection has\\noriginated.\\n\\n_Initial Stage._--Attention is usually first attracted to the condition\\nby a sensation of tightness in the finger and tenderness when the part\\nis squeezed or knocked against anything. In the course of a few hours\\nthe part becomes red and swollen; there is continuous pain, which soon\\nassumes a throbbing character, particularly when the hand is dependent,\\nand may be so severe as to prevent sleep, and the patient may feel\\ngenerally out of sorts.\\n\\nIf a constricting band is applied at this stage, the infection can\\nusually be checked and the occurrence of suppuration prevented. If this\\nfails, or if the condition is allowed to go untreated, the inflammatory\\nreaction increases and terminates in suppuration, giving rise to one or\\nother of the forms of whitlow to be described.\\n\\n_The Purulent Blister._--In the most superficial variety, pus forms\\nbetween the rete Malpighii and the stratum corneum of the skin, the\\nlatter being raised as a blister in which fluctuation can be detected\\n(Fig. 9, a). This is commonly met with in the palm of the hand of\\nlabouring men who have recently resumed work after a spell of idleness.\\nWhen the blister forms near the tip of the finger, the pus burrows under\\nthe nail--which corresponds to the stratum corneum--raising it from its\\nbed.\\n\\nThere is some local heat and discoloration, and considerable pain and\\ntenderness, but little or no constitutional disturbance. Superficial\\nlymphangitis may extend a short distance up the forearm. By clipping\\naway the raised epidermis, and if necessary the nail, the pus is allowed\\nto escape, and healing speedily takes place.\\n\\n_Whitlow at the Nail Fold._--This variety, which is met with among those\\nwho handle septic material, occurs in the sulcus between the nail and\\nthe skin, and is due to the introduction of infective matter at the root\\nof the nail (Fig. 9, b). A small focus of suppuration forms under the\\nnail, with swelling and redness of the nail fold, causing intense pain\\nand discomfort, interfering with sleep, and producing a constitutional\\nreaction out of all proportion to the local lesion.\\n\\nTo allow the pus to escape, it is necessary, under local anaesthesia, to\\ncut away the nail fold as well as the portion of nail in the infected\\narea, or, it may be, to remove the nail entirely. If only a small\\nopening is made in the nail it is apt to be blocked by granulations.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Diagram of various forms of Whitlow.\\n  a = Purulent blister.\\n  b = Suppuration at nail fold.\\n  c = Subcutaneous whitlow.\\n  d = Whitlow in sheath of flexor tendon (e). ]\\n\\n_Subcutaneous Whitlow._--In this variety the infection manifests itself\\nas a cellulitis of the pulp of the finger (Fig. 9, c), which sometimes\\nspreads towards the palm of the hand. The finger becomes red, swollen,\\nand tense; there is severe throbbing pain, which is usually worst at\\nnight and prevents sleep, and the part is extremely tender on pressure.\\nWhen the palm is invaded there may be marked oedema of the back of the\\nhand, the dense integument of the palm preventing the swelling from\\nappearing on the front. The pus may be under such tension that\\nfluctuation cannot be detected. The patient is usually able to flex the\\nfinger to a certain extent without increasing the pain--a point which\\nindicates that the tendon sheaths have not been invaded. The\\nsuppurative process may, however, spread to the tendon sheaths, or even\\nto the bone. Sometimes the excessive tension and virulent toxins induce\\nactual gangrene of the distal part, or even of the whole finger. There\\nis considerable constitutional disturbance, the temperature often\\nreaching 101 o or 102 o F.\\n\\nThe treatment consists in applying a constriction band and making an\\nincision over the centre of the most tender area, care being taken to\\navoid opening the tendon sheath lest the infection be conveyed to it.\\nMoist dressings should be employed while the suppuration lasts. Carbolic\\nfomentations, however, are to be avoided on account of the risk of\\ninducing gangrene.\\n\\n_Whitlow of the Tendon Sheaths._--In this form the main incidence of the\\ninfection is on the sheaths of the flexor tendons, but it is not always\\npossible to determine whether it started there or spread thither from\\nthe subcutaneous cellular tissue (Fig. 9, d). In some cases both\\nconnective tissue planes are involved. The affected finger becomes red,\\npainful, and swollen, the swelling spreading to the dorsum. The\\ninvolvement of the tendon sheath is usually indicated by the patient\\nbeing unable to flex the finger, and by the pain being increased when he\\nattempts to do so. On account of the anatomical arrangement of the\\ntendon sheaths, the process may spread into the forearm--directly in the\\ncase of the thumb and little finger, and after invading the palm in the\\ncase of the other fingers--and there give rise to a diffuse cellulitis\\nwhich may result in sloughing of fasciae and tendons. When the infection\\nspreads into the common flexor sheath under the transverse carpal\\n(anterior annular) ligament, it is not uncommon for the intercarpal and\\nwrist joints to become implicated. Impaired movement of tendons and\\njoints is, therefore, a common sequel to this variety of whitlow.\\n\\nThe _treatment_ consists in inducing passive hyperaemia by Bier\\'s method,\\nand, if this is done early, suppuration may be avoided. If pus forms,\\nsmall incisions are made, under local anaesthesia, to relieve the tension\\nin the sheath and to diminish the risk of the tendons sloughing. No form\\nof drain should be inserted. In the fingers the incisions should be made\\nin the middle line, and in the palm they should be made over the\\nmetacarpal bones to avoid the digital vessels and nerves. If pus has\\nspread under the transverse carpal ligament, the incision must be made\\nabove the wrist. Passive movements and massage must be commenced as\\nearly as possible and be perseveringly employed to diminish the\\nformation of adhesions and resulting stiffness.\\n\\n_Subperiosteal Whitlow._--This form is usually an extension of the\\nsubcutaneous or of the thecal variety, but in some cases the\\ninflammation begins in the periosteum--usually of the terminal phalanx.\\nIt may lead to necrosis of a portion or even of the entire phalanx. This\\nis usually recognised by the persistence of suppuration long after the\\nacute symptoms have passed off, and by feeling bare bone with the probe.\\nIn such cases one or more of the joints are usually implicated also, and\\nlateral mobility and grating may be elicited. Recovery does not take\\nplace until the dead bone is removed, and the usefulness of the finger\\nis often seriously impaired by fibrous or bony ankylosis of the\\ninterphalangeal joints. This may render amputation advisable when a\\nstiff finger is likely to interfere with the patient\\'s occupation.\\n\\n\\nSUPPURATIVE CELLULITIS IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS\\n\\n_Cellulitis of the forearm_ is usually a sequel to one of the deeper\\nvarieties of whitlow.\\n\\nIn the _region of the elbow-joint_, cellulitis is common around the\\nolecranon. It may originate as an inflammation of the olecranon bursa,\\nor may invade the bursa secondarily. In exceptional cases the\\nelbow-joint is also involved.\\n\\nCellulitis of the _axilla_ may originate in suppuration in the lymph\\nglands, following an infected wound of the hand, or it may spread from a\\nseptic wound on the chest wall or in the neck. In some cases it is\\nimpossible to discover the primary seat of infection. A firm, brawny\\nswelling forms in the armpit and extends on to the chest wall. It is\\nattended with great pain, which is increased on moving the arm, and\\nthere is marked constitutional disturbance. When suppuration occurs, its\\nspread is limited by the attachments of the axillary fascia, and the pus\\ntends to burrow on to the chest wall beneath the pectoral muscles, and\\nupwards towards the shoulder-joint, which may become infected. When the\\npus forms in the axillary space, the treatment consists in making free\\nincisions, which should be placed on the thoracic side of the axilla to\\navoid the axillary vessels and nerves. If the pus spreads on to the\\nchest wall, the abscess should be opened below the clavicle by Hilton\\'s\\nmethod, and a counter opening may be made in the axilla.\\n\\nCellulitis of the _sole of the foot_ may follow whitlow of the toes.\\n\\nIn the _region of the ankle_ cellulitis is not common; but _around the\\nknee_ it frequently occurs in relation to the prepatellar bursa and to\\nthe popliteal lymph glands, and may endanger the knee-joint. It is also\\nmet with in the _groin_ following on inflammation and suppuration of the\\ninguinal glands, and cases are recorded in which the sloughing process\\nhas implicated the femoral vessels and led to secondary haemorrhage.\\n\\nCellulitis of the scalp, orbit, neck, pelvis, and perineum will be\\nconsidered with the diseases of these regions.\\n\\n\\nCHRONIC SUPPURATION\\n\\nWhile it is true that a chronic pyogenic abscess is sometimes met\\nwith--for example, in the breast and in the marrow of long bones--in the\\ngreat majority of instances the formation of a chronic or cold abscess\\nis the result of the action of the tubercle bacillus. It is therefore\\nmore convenient to study this form of suppuration with tuberculosis\\n(p. 139).\\n\\n\\nSINUS AND FISTULA\\n\\n#Sinus.#--A sinus is a track leading from a focus of suppuration to a\\ncutaneous or mucous surface. It usually represents the path by which the\\ndischarge escapes from an abscess cavity that has been prevented from\\nclosing completely, either from mechanical causes or from the persistent\\nformation of discharge which must find an exit. A sinus is lined by\\ngranulation tissue, and when it is of long standing the opening may be\\ndragged below the level of the surrounding skin by contraction of the\\nscar tissue around it. As a sinus will persist until the obstacle to\\nclosure of the original abscess is removed, it is necessary that this\\nshould be sought for. It may be a foreign body, such as a piece of dead\\nbone, an infected ligature, or a bullet, acting mechanically or by\\nkeeping up discharge, and if the body is removed the sinus usually\\nheals. The presence of a foreign body is often suggested by a mass of\\nredundant granulations at the mouth of the sinus. If a sinus passes\\nthrough a muscle, the repeated contractions tend to prevent healing\\nuntil the muscle is kept at rest by a splint, or put out of action by\\ndivision of its fibres. The sinuses associated with empyema are\\nprevented from healing by the rigidity of the chest wall, and will only\\nclose after an operation which admits of the cavity being obliterated.\\nIn any case it is necessary to disinfect the track, and, it may be, to\\nremove the unhealthy granulations lining it, by means of the sharp\\nspoon, or to excise it bodily. To encourage healing from the bottom the\\ncavity should be packed with bismuth or iodoform gauze. The healing of\\nlong and tortuous sinuses is often hastened by the injection of Beck\\'s\\nbismuth paste (p. 145). If disfigurement is likely to follow from\\ncicatricial contraction--for example, in a sinus over the lower jaw\\nassociated with a carious tooth--the sinus should be excised and the raw\\nsurfaces approximated with stitches.\\n\\nThe _tuberculous sinus_ is described under Tuberculosis.\\n\\nA #fistula# is an abnormal canal passing from a mucous surface to the\\nskin or to another mucous surface. Fistulae resulting from suppuration\\nusually occur near the natural openings of mucous canals--for example,\\non the cheek, as a salivary fistula; beside the inner angle of the eye,\\nas a lacrymal fistula; near the ear, as a mastoid fistula; or close to\\nthe anus, as a fistula-in-ano. Intestinal fistulae are sometimes met with\\nin the abdominal wall after strangulated hernia, operations for\\nappendicitis, tuberculous peritonitis, and other conditions. In the\\nperineum, fistulae frequently complicate stricture of the urethra.\\n\\nFistulae also occur between the bladder and vagina (_vesico-vaginal\\nfistula_), or between the bladder and the rectum (_recto-vesical\\nfistula_).\\n\\nThe _treatment_ of these various forms of fistula will be described in\\nthe sections dealing with the regions in which they occur.\\n\\n_Congenital fistulae_, such as occur in the neck from imperfect closure\\nof branchial clefts, or in the abdomen from unobliterated foetal ducts\\nsuch as the urachus or Meckel\\'s diverticulum, will be described in their\\nproper places.\\n\\n\\nCONSTITUTIONAL MANIFESTATIONS OF PYOGENIC INFECTION\\n\\nWe have here to consider under the terms Sapraemia, Septicaemia, and\\nPyaemia certain general effects of pyogenic infection, which, although\\ntheir clinical manifestations may vary, are all associated with the\\naction of the same forms of bacteria. They may occur separately or in\\ncombination, or one may follow on and merge into another.\\n\\n#Sapraemia#, or septic intoxication, is the name applied to a form of\\npoisoning resulting from the absorption into the blood of the toxic\\nproducts of pyogenic bacteria. These products, which are of the nature\\nof alkaloids, act immediately on their entrance into the circulation,\\nand produce effects in direct proportion to the amount absorbed. As the\\ntoxins are gradually eliminated from the body the symptoms abate, and if\\nno more are introduced they disappear. Sapraemia in these respects,\\ntherefore, is comparable to poisoning by any other form of alkaloid,\\nsuch as strychnin or morphin.\\n\\n_Clinical Features._--The symptoms of sapraemia seldom manifest\\nthemselves within twenty-four hours of an operation or injury, because\\nit takes some time for the bacteria to produce a sufficient dose of\\ntheir poisons. The onset of the condition is marked by a feeling of\\nchilliness, sometimes amounting to a rigor, and a rise of temperature to\\n102 o, 103 o, or 104 o F., with morning remissions (Fig. 10). The heart\\'s\\naction is markedly depressed, and the pulse is soft and compressible.\\nThe appetite is lost, the tongue dry and covered with a thin\\nbrownish-red fur, so that it has the appearance of \"dried beef.\" The\\nurine is scanty and loaded with urates. In severe cases diarrhoea and\\nvomiting of dark coffee-ground material are often prominent features.\\nDeath is usually impending when the skin becomes cold and clammy, the\\nmucous membranes livid, the pulse feeble and fluttering, the discharges\\ninvoluntary, and when a low form of muttering delirium is present.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Charts of Acute sapraemia from (a) case of\\ncrushed foot, and (b) case of incomplete abortion.]\\n\\nA local form of septic infection is always present--it may be an\\nabscess, an infected compound fracture, or an infection of the cavity of\\nthe uterus, for example, from a retained portion of placenta.\\n\\n_Treatment._--The first indication is the immediate and complete removal\\nof the infected material. The wound must be freely opened, all\\nblood-clot, discharge, or necrosed tissue removed, and the area\\ndisinfected by washing with sterilised salt solution, peroxide of\\nhydrogen, or eusol. Stronger lotions are to be avoided as being likely\\nto depress the tissues, and so interfere with protective phagocytosis.\\nOn account of its power of neutralising toxins, iodoform is useful in\\nthese cases, and is best employed by packing the wound with iodoform\\ngauze, and treating it by the open method, if this is possible.\\n\\nThe general treatment is carried out on the same lines as for other\\ninfective conditions.\\n\\n#Chronic sapraemia or Hectic Fever.#--Hectic fever differs from acute\\nsapraemia merely in degree. It usually occurs in connection with\\ntuberculous conditions, such as bone or joint disease, psoas abscess, or\\nempyema, which have opened externally, and have thereby become infected\\nwith pyogenic organisms. It is gradual in its development, and is of a\\nmild type throughout.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Chart of Hectic Fever.]\\n\\nThe pulse is small, feeble, and compressible, and the temperature rises\\nin the afternoon or evening to 102 o or 103 o F. (Fig. 11), the cheeks\\nbecoming characteristically flushed. In the early morning the\\ntemperature falls to normal or below it, and the patient breaks into a\\nprofuse perspiration, which leaves him pale, weak, and exhausted. He\\nbecomes rapidly and markedly emaciated, even although in some cases the\\nappetite remains good and is even voracious.\\n\\nThe poisons circulating in the blood produce _waxy degeneration_ in\\ncertain viscera, notably the liver, spleen, kidneys, and intestines. The\\nprocess begins in the arterial walls, and spreads thence to the\\nconnective-tissue structures, causing marked enlargement of the affected\\norgans. Albuminuria, ascites, oedema of the lower limbs, clubbing of the\\nfingers, and diarrhoea are among the most prominent symptoms of this\\ncondition.\\n\\nThe _prognosis_ in hectic fever depends on the completeness with which\\nthe further absorption of toxins can be prevented. In many cases this\\ncan only be effected by an operation which provides for free drainage,\\nand, if possible, the removal of infected tissues. The resulting wound\\nis best treated by the open method. Even advanced waxy degeneration does\\nnot contra-indicate this line of treatment, as the diseased organs\\nusually recover if the focus from which absorption of toxic material is\\ntaking place is completely eradicated.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Chart of case of Septicaemia followed by\\nPyaemia.]\\n\\n#Septicaemia.#--This form of blood-poisoning is the result of the action\\nof pyogenic bacteria, which not only produce their toxins at the primary\\nseat of infection, but themselves enter the blood-stream and are carried\\nto other parts, where they settle and produce further effects.\\n\\n_Clinical Features._--There may be an incubation period of some hours\\nbetween the infection and the first manifestation of acute septicaemia.\\nIn such conditions as acute osteomyelitis or acute peritonitis, we see\\nthe most typical clinical pictures of this condition. The onset is\\nmarked by a chill, or a rigor, which may be repeated, while the\\ntemperature rises to 103 o or 104 o F., although in very severe cases the\\ntemperature may remain subnormal throughout, the virulence of the toxins\\npreventing reaction. It is in the general appearance of the patient and\\nin the condition of the pulse that we have our best guides as to the\\nseverity of the condition. If the pulse remains firm, full, and regular,\\nand does not exceed 110 or even 120, while the temperature is moderately\\nraised, the outlook is hopeful; but when the pulse becomes small and\\ncompressible, and reaches 130 or more, especially if at the same time\\nthe temperature is low, a grave prognosis is indicated. The tongue is\\noften dry and coated with a black crust down the centre, while the sides\\nare red. It is a good omen when the tongue becomes moist again. Thirst\\nis most distressing, especially in septicaemia of intestinal origin.\\nPersistent vomiting of dark-brown material is often present, and\\ndiarrhoea with blood-stained stools is not uncommon. The urine is small\\nin amount, and contains a large proportion of urates. As the poisons\\naccumulate, the respiration becomes shallow and laboured, the face of a\\ndull ashy grey, the nose pinched, and the skin cold and clammy.\\nCapillary haemorrhages sometimes take place in the skin or mucous\\nmembranes; and in a certain proportion of cases cutaneous eruptions\\nsimulating those of scarlet fever or measles appear, and are apt to lead\\nto errors in diagnosis. In other cases there is slight jaundice. The\\nmental state is often one of complete apathy, the patient failing to\\nrealise the gravity of his condition; sometimes there is delirium.\\n\\nThe _prognosis_ is always grave, and depends on the possibility of\\ncompletely eradicating the focus of infection, and on the reserve force\\nthe patient has to carry him over the period during which he is\\neliminating the poison already circulating in his blood.\\n\\nThe _treatment_ is carried out on the same lines as in sapraemia, but it\\nis less likely to be successful owing to the organisms having entered\\nthe circulation. When possible, the primary focus of infection should be\\ndealt with.\\n\\n#Pyaemia# is a form of blood-poisoning characterised by the development\\nof secondary foci of suppuration in different parts of the body. Toxins\\nare thus introduced into the blood, not only at the primary seat of\\ninfection, but also from each of these metastatic collections. Like\\nsepticaemia, this condition is due to pyogenic bacteria, the\\n_streptococcus pyogenes_ being the commonest organism found. The primary\\ninfection is usually in a wound--for example, a compound fracture--but\\ncases occur in which the point of entrance of the bacteria is not\\ndiscoverable. The dissemination of the organisms takes place through the\\nmedium of infected emboli which form in a thrombosed vein in the\\nvicinity of the original lesion, and, breaking loose, are carried\\nthence in the blood-stream. These emboli lodge in the minute vessels of\\nthe lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, pleura, brain, synovial membranes, or\\ncellular tissue, and the bacteria they contain give rise to secondary\\nfoci of suppuration. Secondary abscesses are thus formed in those parts,\\nand these in turn may be the starting-point of new emboli which give\\nrise to fresh areas of pus formation. The organs above named are the\\ncommonest situations of pyaemic abscesses, but these may also occur in\\nthe bone marrow, the substance of muscles, the heart and pericardium,\\nlymph glands, subcutaneous tissue, or, in fact, in any tissue of the\\nbody. Organisms circulating in the blood are prone to lodge on the\\nvalves of the heart and give rise to endocarditis.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Chart of Pyaemia following on Acute\\nOsteomyelitis.]\\n\\n_Clinical Features._--Before antiseptic surgery was practised, pyaemia\\nwas a common complication of wounds. In the present day it is not only\\ninfinitely less common, but appears also to be of a less severe type.\\nIts rarity and its mildness may be related as cause and effect, because\\nit was formerly found that pyaemia contracted from a pyaemic patient was\\nmore virulent than that from other sources.\\n\\nIn contrast with sapraemia and septicaemia, pyaemia is late of developing,\\nand it seldom begins within a week of the primary infection. The first\\nsign is a feeling of chilliness, or a violent rigor lasting for perhaps\\nhalf an hour, during which time the temperature rises to 103 o, 104 o, or\\n105 o F. In the course of an hour it begins to fall again, and the\\npatient breaks into a profuse sweat. The temperature may fall several\\ndegrees, but seldom reaches the normal. In a few days there is a second\\nrigor with rise of temperature, and another remission, and such attacks\\nmay be repeated at diminishing intervals during the course of the\\nillness (Figs. 12 and 13). The pulse is soft, and tends to remain\\nabnormally rapid even when the temperature falls nearly to normal.\\n\\nThe face is flushed, and wears a drawn, anxious expression, and the eyes\\nare bright. A characteristic sweetish odour, which has been compared to\\nthat of new-mown hay, can be detected in the breath and may pervade the\\npatient. The appetite is lost; there may be sickness and vomiting and\\nprofuse diarrhoea; and the patient emaciates rapidly. The skin is\\ncontinuously hot, and has often a peculiar pungent feel. Patches of\\nerythema sometimes appear scattered over the body. The skin may assume a\\ndull sallow or earthy hue, or a bright yellow icteric tint may appear.\\nThe conjunctivae also may be yellow. In the latter stages of the disease\\nthe pulse becomes small and fluttering; the tongue becomes dry and\\nbrown; sordes collect on the teeth; and a low muttering form of delirium\\nsupervenes.\\n\\nSecondary infection of the parotid gland frequently occurs, and gives\\nrise to a suppurative parotitis. This condition is associated with\\nsevere pain, gradually extending from behind the angle of the jaw on to\\nthe face. There is also swelling over the gland, and eventually\\nsuppuration and sloughing of the gland tissue and overlying skin.\\n\\nSecondary abscesses in the lymph glands, subcutaneous tissue, or joints\\nare often so insidious and painless in their development that they are\\nonly discovered accidentally. When the abscess is evacuated, healing\\noften takes place with remarkable rapidity, and with little impairment\\nof function.\\n\\nThe general symptoms may be simulated by an attack of malaria.\\n\\n_Prognosis._--The prognosis in acute pyaemia is much less hopeless than\\nit once was, a considerable proportion of the patients recovering. In\\nacute cases the disease proves fatal in ten days or a fortnight, death\\nbeing due to toxaemia. Chronic cases often run a long course, lasting for\\nweeks or even months, and prove fatal from exhaustion and waxy disease\\nfollowing on prolonged suppuration.\\n\\n_Treatment._--In such conditions as compound fractures and severe\\nlacerated wounds, much can be done to avert the conditions which lead to\\npyaemia, by applying a Bier\\'s constricting bandage as soon as there is\\nevidence of infection having taken place, or even if there is reason to\\nsuspect that the wound is not aseptic.\\n\\nIf sepsis is already established, and evidence of general infection is\\npresent, the wound should be opened up sufficiently to admit of thorough\\ndisinfection and drainage, and the constricting bandage applied to aid\\nthe defensive processes going on in the tissues. If these measures fail,\\namputation of the limb may be the only means of preventing further\\ndissemination of infective material from the primary source of\\ninfection.\\n\\nAttempts have been made to interrupt the channel along which the\\ninfective emboli spread, by ligating or resecting the main vein of the\\naffected part, but this is seldom feasible except in the case of the\\ninternal jugular vein for infection of the transverse sinus.\\n\\nSecondary abscesses must be aspirated or opened and drained whenever\\npossible.\\n\\nThe general treatment is conducted on the same lines as on other forms\\nof pyogenic infection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nULCERATION AND ULCERS\\n\\n\\nDefinitions--Clinical examination of an ulcer--The healing\\n    sore.--Classification of ulcers--A. According to cause:\\n    _Traumatism_, _Imperfect circulation_, _Imperfect nerve-supply_,\\n    _Constitutional causes_--B. According to condition: _Healing_,\\n    _Stationary_, _Spreading_.--Treatment.\\n\\nThe process of _ulceration_ may be defined as the molecular or cellular\\ndeath of tissue taking place on a free surface. It is essentially of the\\nsame nature as the process of suppuration, only that the purulent\\ndischarge, instead of collecting in a closed cavity and forming an\\nabscess, at once escapes on the surface.\\n\\nAn _ulcer_ is an open wound or sore in which there are present certain\\nconditions tending to prevent it undergoing the natural process of\\nrepair. Of these, one of the most important is the presence of\\npathogenic bacteria, which by their action not only prevent healing, but\\nso irritate and destroy the tissues as to lead to an actual increase in\\nthe size of the sore. Interference with the nutrition of a part by oedema\\nor chronic venous congestion may impede healing; as may also induration\\nof the surrounding area, by preventing the contraction which is such an\\nimportant factor in repair. Defective innervation, such as occurs in\\ninjuries and diseases of the spinal cord, also plays an important part\\nin delaying repair. In certain constitutional conditions, too--for\\nexample, Bright\\'s disease, diabetes, or syphilis--the vitiated state of\\nthe tissues is an impediment to repair. Mechanical causes, such as\\nunsuitable dressings or ill-fitting appliances, may also act in the same\\ndirection.\\n\\n#Clinical Examination of an Ulcer.#--In examining any ulcer, we\\nobserve--(1) Its _base_ or _floor_, noting the presence or absence of\\ngranulations, their disposition, size, colour, vascularity, and whether\\nthey are depressed or elevated in relation to the surrounding parts. (2)\\nThe _discharge_ as to quantity, consistence, colour, composition, and\\nodour. (3) The _edges_, noting particularly whether or not the marginal\\nepithelium is attempting to grow over the surface; also their shape,\\nregularity, thickness, and whether undermined or overlapping, everted or\\ndepressed. (4) The _surrounding tissues_, as to whether they are\\ncongested, oedematous, inflamed, indurated, or otherwise. (5) Whether or\\nnot there is _pain_ or tenderness in the raw surface or its\\nsurroundings. (6) The _part of the body_ on which it occurs, because\\ncertain ulcers have special seats of election--for example, the varicose\\nulcer in the lower third of the leg, the perforating ulcer on the sole\\nof the foot, and so on.\\n\\n#The Healing Sore.#--If a portion of skin be excised aseptically, and no\\nattempt made to close the wound, the raw surface left is soon covered\\nover with a layer of coagulated blood and lymph. In the course of a few\\ndays this is replaced by the growth of _granulations_, which are of\\nuniform size, of a pinkish-red colour, and moist with a slight serous\\nexudate containing a few dead leucocytes. They grow until they reach the\\nlevel of the surrounding skin, and so fill the gap with a fine velvety\\nmass of granulation tissue. At the edges, the young epithelium may be\\nseen spreading in over the granulations as a fine bluish-white pellicle,\\nwhich gradually covers the sore, becoming paler in colour as it\\nthickens, and eventually forming the smooth, non-vascular covering of\\nthe cicatrix. There is no pain, and the surrounding parts are healthy.\\n\\nThis may be used as a type with which to compare the ulcers seen at the\\nbedside, so that we may determine how far, and in what particulars,\\nthese differ from the type; and that we may in addition recognise the\\nconditions that have to be counteracted before the characters of the\\ntypical healing sore are assumed.\\n\\nFor purposes of contrast we may indicate the characters of an open sore\\nin which bacterial infection with pathogenic bacteria has taken place.\\nThe layer of coagulated blood and lymph becomes liquefied and is thrown\\noff, and instead of granulations being formed, the tissues exposed on\\nthe floor of the ulcer are destroyed by the bacterial toxins, with the\\nformation of minute sloughs and a quantity of pus.\\n\\nThe discharge is profuse, thin, acrid, and offensive, and consists of\\npus, broken-down blood-clot, and sloughs. The edges are inflamed,\\nirregular, and ragged, showing no sign of growing epithelium--on the\\ncontrary, the sore may be actually increasing in area by the\\nbreaking-down of the tissues at its margins. The surrounding parts are\\nhot, red, swollen, and oedematous; and there is pain and tenderness both\\nin the sore itself and in the parts around.\\n\\n#Classification of Ulcers.#--The nomenclature of ulcers is much involved\\nand gives rise to great confusion, chiefly for the reason that no one\\nbasis of classification has been adopted. Thus some ulcers are named\\naccording to the causes at work in producing or maintaining them--for\\nexample, the traumatic, the septic, and the varicose ulcer; some from\\nthe constitutional element present, as the gouty and the diabetic ulcer;\\nand others according to the condition in which they happen to be when\\nseen by the surgeon, such as the weak, the inflamed, and the callous\\nulcer.\\n\\nSo long as we retain these names it will be impossible to find a single\\nbasis for classification; and yet many of the terms are so descriptive\\nand so generally understood that it is undesirable to abolish them. We\\nmust therefore remain content with a clinical arrangement of ulcers,--it\\ncannot be called a classification,--considering any given ulcer from two\\npoints of view: first its _cause_, and second its _present condition_.\\nThis method of studying ulcers has the practical advantage that it\\nfurnishes us with the main indications for treatment as well as for\\ndiagnosis: the cause must be removed, and the condition so modified as\\nto convert the ulcer into an aseptic healing sore.\\n\\nA. #Arrangement of Ulcers according to their Cause.#--Although any given\\nulcer may be due to a combination of causes, it is convenient to\\ndescribe the following groups:\\n\\n_Ulcers due to Traumatism._--Traumatism in the form of a _crush_ or\\n_bruise_ is a frequent cause of ulcer formation, acting either by\\ndirectly destroying the skin, or by so diminishing its vitality that it\\nis rendered a suitable soil for bacteria. If these gain access, in the\\ncourse of a few days the damaged area of skin becomes of a greyish\\ncolour, blebs form on it, and it undergoes necrosis, leaving an\\nunhealthy raw surface when the slough separates.\\n\\n_Heat_ and _prolonged exposure to the Rontgen rays_ or _to radium\\nemanations_ act in a similar way.\\n\\nThe _pressure_ of improperly padded splints or other appliances may so\\nfar interfere with the circulation of the part pressed upon, that the\\nskin sloughs, leaving an open sore. This is most liable to occur in\\npatients who suffer from some nerve lesion--such as anterior\\npoliomyelitis, or injury of the spinal cord or nerve-trunks.\\nSplint-pressure sores are usually situated over bony prominences, such\\nas the malleoli, the condyles of the femur or humerus, the head of the\\nfibula, the dorsum of the foot, or the base of the fifth metatarsal\\nbone. On removing the splint, the skin of the part pressed upon is found\\nto be of a red or pink colour, with a pale grey patch in the centre,\\nwhich eventually sloughs and leaves an ulcer. Certain forms of\\n_bed-sore_ are also due to prolonged pressure.\\n\\nPressure sores are also known to have been produced artificially by\\nmalingerers and hysterical subjects.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Leg Ulcers associated with Varicose Veins and\\nPigmentation of the Skin.]\\n\\n_Ulcers due to Imperfect Circulation._--Imperfect circulation is an\\nimportant causative factor in ulceration, especially when it is the\\n_venous return_ that is defective. This is best illustrated in the\\nso-called _leg ulcer_, which occurs most frequently on the front and\\nmedial aspect of the lower third of the leg. At this point the\\nanastomosis between the superficial and deep veins of the leg is less\\nfree than elsewhere, so that the extra stress thrown upon the surface\\nveins interferes with the nutrition of the skin (Hilton). The importance\\nof imperfect venous return in the causation of such ulcers is evidenced\\nby the fact that as soon as the condition of the circulation is improved\\nby confining the patient to bed and elevating the limb, the ulcer begins\\nto heal, even although all methods of local treatment have hitherto\\nproved ineffectual. In a considerable number of cases, but by no means\\nin all, this form of ulcer is associated with the presence of varicose\\nveins, and in such cases it is spoken of as the _varicose ulcer_ (Fig. 14).\\nThe presence of varicose veins is frequently associated with a\\ndiffuse brownish or bluish pigmentation of the skin of the lower third\\nof the leg, or with an obstinate form of dermatitis (_varicose eczema_),\\nand the scratching or rubbing of the part is liable to cause a breach of\\nthe surface and permit of infection which leads to ulceration. Varicose\\nulcers may also originate from the bursting of a small peri-phlebitic\\nabscess.\\n\\nVaricose veins in immediate relation to the base of a large chronic\\nulcer usually become thrombosed, and in time are reduced to fibrous\\ncords, and therefore in such cases haemorrhage is not a common\\ncomplication. In smaller and more superficial ulcers, however, the\\ndestructive process is liable to implicate the wall of the vessel before\\nthe occurrence of thrombosis, and to lead to profuse and it may be\\ndangerous bleeding.\\n\\nThese ulcers are at first small and superficial, but from want of care,\\nfrom continued standing or walking, or from injudicious treatment, they\\ngradually become larger and deeper. They are not infrequently multiple,\\nand this, together with their depth, may lead to their being mistaken\\nfor ulcers due to syphilis. The base of the ulcer is covered with\\nimperfectly formed, soft, oedematous granulations, which give off a thin\\nsero-purulent discharge. The edges are slightly inflamed, and show no\\nevidence of healing. The parts around are usually pigmented and slightly\\noedematous, and as a rule there is little pain. This variety of ulcer is\\nparticularly prone to pass into the condition known as callous.\\n\\nIn _anaemic_ patients, especially young girls, ulcers are occasionally\\nmet with which have many of the clinical characters of those associated\\nwith imperfect venous return. They are slow to heal, and tend to pass\\ninto the condition known as weak.\\n\\n_Ulcers due to Interference with Nerve-Supply._--Any interference with\\nthe nerve-supply of the superficial tissues predisposes to ulceration.\\nFor example, _trophic_ ulcers are liable to occur in injuries or\\ndiseases of the spinal cord, in cerebral paralysis, in limbs weakened by\\npoliomyelitis, in ascending or peripheral neuritis, or after injuries of\\nnerve-trunks.\\n\\nThe _acute bed-sore_ is a rapidly progressing form of ulceration, often\\namounting to gangrene, of portions of skin exposed to pressure when\\ntheir trophic nerve-supply has been interfered with.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Perforating Ulcers of Sole of Foot.\\n\\n(From Photograph lent by Sir Montagu Cotterill.)]\\n\\nThe _perforating ulcer of the foot_ is a peculiar type of sore which\\noccurs in association with the different forms of peripheral neuritis,\\nand with various lesions of the brain and spinal cord, such as general\\nparalysis, locomotor ataxia, or syringo-myelia (Fig. 15). It also occurs\\nin patients suffering from glycosuria, and is usually associated with\\narterio-sclerosis--local or general. Perforating ulcer is met with most\\nfrequently under the head of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. A\\ncallosity forms and suppuration occurs under it, the pus escaping\\nthrough a small hole in the centre. The process slowly and gradually\\nspreads deeper and deeper, till eventually the bone or joint is reached,\\nand becomes implicated in the destructive process--hence the term\\n\"perforating ulcer.\" The flexor tendons are sometimes destroyed, the toe\\nbeing dorsiflexed by the unopposed extensors. The depth of the track\\nbeing so disproportionate to its superficial area, the condition closely\\nsimulates a tuberculous sinus, for which it is liable to be mistaken.\\nThe raw surface is absolutely insensitive, so that the probe can be\\nfreely employed without the patient even being aware of it or suffering\\nthe least discomfort--a significant fact in diagnosis. The cavity is\\nfilled with effete and decomposing epidermis, which has a most offensive\\nodour. The chronic and intractable character of the ulcer is due to\\ninterference with the trophic nerve-supply of the parts, and to the fact\\nthat the epithelium of the skin grows in and lines the track leading\\ndown to the deepest part of the ulcer and so prevents closure. While\\nthey are commonest on the sole of the foot and other parts subjected to\\npressure, perforating ulcers are met with on the sides and dorsum of the\\nfoot and toes, on the hands, and on other parts where no pressure has\\nbeen exerted.\\n\\nThe _tuberculous ulcer_, so often seen in the neck, in the vicinity of\\njoints, or over the ribs and sternum, usually results from the bursting\\nthrough the skin of a tuberculous abscess. The base is soft, pale, and\\ncovered with feeble granulations and grey shreddy sloughs. The edges are\\nof a dull blue or purple colour, and gradually thin out towards their\\nfree margins, and in addition are characteristically undermined, so that\\na probe can be passed for some distance between the floor of the ulcer\\nand the thinned-out edges. Thin, devitalised tags of skin often stretch\\nfrom side to side of the ulcer. The outline is irregular; small\\nperforations often occur through the skin, and a thin, watery discharge,\\ncontaining grey shreds of tuberculous debris, escapes.\\n\\n_Bazin\\'s Disease._--This term is applied to an affection of the skin and\\nsubcutaneous tissue which bears certain resemblances to tuberculosis. It\\nis met with almost exclusively between the knee and the ankle, and it\\nusually affects both legs. It is commonest in girls of delicate\\nconstitution, in whose family history there is evidence of a tuberculous\\ntaint. The patient often presents other lesions of a tuberculous\\ncharacter, notably enlarged cervical glands, and phlyctenular\\nophthalmia. The tubercle bacillus has rarely been found, but we have\\nalways observed characteristic epithelioid cells and giant cells in\\nsections made from the edge or floor of the ulcer.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Bazin\\'s Disease in a girl aet. 16.]\\n\\nThe condition begins by the formation in the skin and subcutaneous\\ntissue of dusky or livid nodules of induration, which soften and\\nulcerate, forming small open sores with ragged and undermined edges, not\\nunlike those resulting from the breaking down of superficial syphilitic\\ngummata (Fig. 16). Fresh crops of nodules appear in the neighbourhood of\\nthe ulcers, and in turn break down. While in the nodular stage the\\naffection is sometimes painful, but with the formation of the ulcer the\\npain subsides.\\n\\nThe disease runs a chronic course, and may slowly extend over a wide\\narea in spite of the usual methods of treatment. After lasting for some\\nmonths, or even years, however, it may eventually undergo spontaneous\\ncure. The most satisfactory treatment is to excise the affected tissues\\nand fill the gap with skin-grafts.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Syphilitic Ulcers in region of Knee, showing\\npunched-out appearance and raised indurated edges.]\\n\\nThe _syphilitic ulcer_ is usually formed by the breaking down of a\\ncutaneous or subcutaneous gumma in the tertiary stage of syphilis. When\\nthe gummatous tissue is first exposed by the destruction of the skin or\\nmucous membrane covering it, it appears as a tough greyish slough,\\ncompared to \"wash leather,\" which slowly separates and leaves a more or\\nless circular, deep, punched-out gap which shows a few feeble unhealthy\\ngranulations and small sloughs on its floor. The edges are raised and\\nindurated; and the discharge is thick, glairy, and peculiarly offensive.\\nThe parts around the ulcer are congested and of a dark brown colour.\\nThere are usually several such ulcers together, and as they tend to heal\\nat one part while they spread at another, the affected area assumes a\\nsinuous or serpiginous outline. Syphilitic ulcers may be met with in any\\npart of the body, but are most frequent in the upper part of the leg\\n(Fig. 17), especially around the knee-joint in women, and over the ribs\\nand sternum. On healing, they usually leave a depressed and adherent\\ncicatrix.\\n\\nThe _scorbutic ulcer_ occurs in patients suffering from scurvy, and is\\ncharacterised by its prominent granulations, which show a marked\\ntendency to bleed, with the formation of clots, which dry and form a\\nspongy crust on the surface.\\n\\nIn _gouty_ patients small ulcers which are exceedingly irritable and\\npainful are liable to occur.\\n\\n_Ulcers associated with Malignant Disease._--Cancer and sarcoma when\\nsituated in the subcutaneous tissue may destroy the overlying skin so\\nthat the substance of the tumour is exposed. The fungating masses thus\\nproduced are sometimes spoken of as malignant ulcers, but as they are\\nessentially different in their nature from all other forms of ulcers,\\nand call for totally different treatment, it is best to consider them\\nalong with the tumours with which they are associated. Rodent ulcer,\\nwhich is one form of cancer of the skin, will be discussed with new\\ngrowths of the skin.\\n\\nB. #Arrangement of Ulcers according to their Condition.#--Having arrived\\nat an opinion as to the cause of a given ulcer, and placed it in one or\\nother of the preceding groups, the next question to ask is, In what\\ncondition do I find this ulcer at the present moment?\\n\\nAny ulcer is in one of three states--healing, stationary, or spreading;\\nalthough it is not uncommon to find healing going on at one part while\\nthe destructive process is extending at another.\\n\\n_The Healing Condition._--The process of healing in an ulcer has already\\nbeen studied, and we have learned that it takes place by the formation\\nof granulation tissue, which becomes converted into connective tissue,\\nand is covered over by epithelium growing in from the edges.\\n\\nThose ulcers which are _stationary_--that is, neither healing nor\\nspreading--may be in one of several conditions.\\n\\n_The Weak Condition._--Any ulcer may get into a weak state from\\nreceiving a blood supply which is defective either in quantity or in\\nquality. The granulations are small and smooth, and of a pale yellow or\\ngrey colour, the discharge is small in amount, and consists of thin\\nserum and a few pus cells, and as this dries on the edges it forms scabs\\nwhich interfere with the growth of epithelium.\\n\\nShould the part become oedematous, either from general causes, such as\\nheart or kidney disease, or from local causes, such as varicose veins,\\nthe granulations share in the oedema, and there is an abundant serous\\ndischarge.\\n\\nThe excessive use of moist dressings leads to a third variety of weak\\nulcer--namely, one in which the granulations become large, soft, pale,\\nand flabby, projecting beyond the level of the skin and overlapping the\\nedges, which become pale and sodden. The term \"proud flesh\" is popularly\\napplied to such redundant granulations.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Callous Ulcer, showing thickened edges and\\nindurated swelling of surrounding parts.]\\n\\n_The Callous Condition._--This condition is usually met with in ulcers\\non the lower third of the leg, and is often associated with the presence\\nof varicose veins. It is chiefly met with in hospital practice. The want\\nof healing is mainly due to impeded venous return and to oedema and\\ninduration of the surrounding skin and cellular tissues (Fig. 18). The\\ninduration results from coagulation and partial organisation of the\\ninflammatory effusion, and prevents the necessary contraction of the\\nsore. The base of a callous ulcer lies at some distance below the level\\nof the swollen, thickened, and white edges, and presents a glazed\\nappearance, such granulations as are present being unhealthy and\\nirregular. The discharge is usually watery, and cakes in the dressing.\\nWhen from neglect and want of cleanliness the ulcer becomes inflamed,\\nthere is considerable pain, and the discharge is purulent and often\\noffensive.\\n\\nThe prolonged hyperaemia of the tissues in relation to a callous ulcer of\\nthe leg often leads to changes in the underlying bones. The periosteum\\nis abnormally thick and vascular, the superficial layers of the bone\\nbecome injected and porous, and the bones, as a whole, are thickened. In\\nthe macerated bone \"the surface is covered with irregular,\\nstalactite-like processes or foliaceous masses, which, to a certain\\nextent, follow the line of attachment of the interosseous membrane and\\nof the intermuscular septa\" (Cathcart) (Fig. 19). When the whole\\nthickness of the soft tissues is destroyed by the ulcerative process,\\nthe area of bone that comes to form the base of the ulcer projects as a\\nflat, porous node, which in its turn may be eroded. These changes as\\nseen in the macerated specimen are often mistaken for disease\\noriginating in the bone.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Tibia and Fibula, showing changes due to\\nchronic ulcer of leg.]\\n\\nThe _irritable condition_ is met with in ulcers which occur, as a rule,\\njust above the external malleolus in women of neurotic temperament. They\\nare small in size and have prominent granulations, and by the aid of a\\nprobe points of excessive tenderness may be discovered. These, Hilton\\nbelieved, correspond to exposed nerve filaments.\\n\\n_Ulcers which are spreading_ may be met with in one of several\\nconditions.\\n\\n_The Inflamed Condition._--Any ulcer may become acutely inflamed from\\nthe access of fresh organisms, aided by mechanical irritation from\\ntrauma, ill-fitting splints or bandages, or want of rest, or from\\nchemical irritants, such as strong antiseptics. The best clinical\\nexample of an inflamed ulcer is the venereal soft sore. The base of the\\nulcer becomes red and angry-looking, the granulations disappear, and a\\ncopious discharge of thin yellow pus, mixed with blood, escapes. Sloughs\\nof granulation tissue or of connective tissue may form. The edges become\\nred, ragged, and everted, and the ulcer increases in size by spreading\\ninto the inflamed and oedematous surrounding tissues. Such ulcers are\\nfrequently multiple. Pain is a constant symptom, and is often severe,\\nand there is usually some constitutional disturbance.\\n\\nThe _phagedaenic condition_ is the result of an ulcer being infected with\\nspecially virulent bacteria. It occurs in syphilitic ulcers, and rapidly\\nleads to a widespread destruction of tissue. It is also met with in the\\nthroat in some cases of scarlet fever, and may give rise to fatal\\nhaemorrhage by ulcerating into large blood vessels. All the local and\\nconstitutional signs of a severe septic infection are present.\\n\\n#Treatment of Ulcers.#--An ulcer is not only an immediate cause of\\nsuffering to the patient, crippling and incapacitating him for his work,\\nbut is a distinct and constant menace to his health: the prolonged\\ndischarge reduces his strength; the open sore is a possible source of\\ninfection by the organisms of suppuration, erysipelas, or other specific\\ndiseases; phlebitis, with formation of septic emboli, leading to pyaemia,\\nis liable to occur; and in old persons it is not uncommon for ulcers of\\nlong standing to become the seat of cancer. In addition, the offensive\\nodour of many ulcers renders the patient a source of annoyance and\\ndiscomfort to others. The primary object of treatment in any ulcer is to\\nbring it into the condition of a healing sore. When this has been\\neffected, nature will do the rest, provided extraneous sources of\\nirritation are excluded.\\n\\nSteps must be taken to facilitate the venous return from the ulcerated\\npart, and to ensure that a sufficient supply of fresh, healthy blood\\nreaches it. The septic element must be eliminated by disinfecting the\\nulcer and its surroundings, and any other sources of irritation must be\\nremoved.\\n\\nIf the patient\\'s health is below par, good nourishing food, tonics, and\\ngeneral hygienic treatment are indicated.\\n\\n_Management of a Healing Sore._--Perhaps the best dressing for a healing\\nsore is a layer of Lister\\'s perforated oiled-silk protective, which is\\nmade to cover the raw surface and the skin for about a quarter of an\\ninch beyond the margins of the sore. Over this three or four thicknesses\\nof sterilised gauze, wrung out of eusol, creolin, or sterilised water,\\nare applied, and covered by a pad of absorbent wool. As far as possible\\nthe part should be kept at rest, and the position should be adjusted so\\nas to favour the circulation in the affected area.\\n\\nThe dressing may be renewed at intervals, and care must be taken to\\navoid any rough handling of the sore. Any discharge that lies on the\\nsurface should be removed by a gentle stream of lotion rather than by\\nwiping. The area round the sore should be cleansed before the fresh\\ndressing is applied.\\n\\nIn some cases, healing goes on more rapidly under a dressing of weak\\nboracic ointment (one-quarter the strength of the pharmacopoeial\\npreparation). The growth of epithelium may be stimulated by a 6 to 8 per\\ncent. ointment of scarlet-red.\\n\\nDusting powders and poultice dressings are best avoided in the treatment\\nof healing sores.\\n\\nIn extensive ulcers resulting from recent burns, if the granulations are\\nhealthy and aseptic, skin-grafts may safely be placed on them directly.\\nIf, however, their asepticity cannot be relied upon, it is necessary to\\nscrape away the superficial layer of the granulations, the young fibrous\\ntissue underneath being conserved, as it is sufficiently vascular to\\nnourish the grafts placed on it.\\n\\n#Treatment of Special Varieties of Ulcers.#--Before beginning to treat a\\ngiven ulcer, two questions have to be answered--first, What are the\\ncausative conditions present? and second, In what condition do I find\\nthe ulcer?--in other words, In what particulars does it differ from a\\nhealthy healing sore?\\n\\nIf the cause is a local one, it must be removed; if a constitutional\\none, means must be taken to counteract it. This done, the condition of\\nthe ulcer must be so modified as to bring it into the state of a healing\\nsore, after which it will be managed on the lines already laid down.\\n\\n#Treatment in relation to the Cause of the Ulcer.#--_Traumatic\\nGroup._--The _prophylaxis_ of these ulcers consists in excluding\\nbacteria, by cleansing crushed or bruised parts, and applying sterilised\\ndressings and properly adjusted splints. If there is reason to fear that\\nthe disinfection has not been complete, a Bier\\'s constricting bandage\\nshould be applied for some hours each day. These measures will often\\nprevent a grossly injured portion of skin dying, and will ensure\\nasepticity should it do so. In the event of the skin giving way, the\\nsame form of dressing should be continued till the slough has separated\\nand a healthy granulating surface is formed. The protective dressing\\nappropriate to a healing sore is then substituted. _Pressure sores_ are\\ntreated on the same lines.\\n\\nThe treatment of ulcers caused by _burns and scalds_ will be described\\nlater.\\n\\nIn _ulcers of the leg due to interference with the venous return_, the\\nprimary indication is to elevate the limb in order to facilitate the\\nflow of the blood in the veins, and so admit of fresh blood reaching the\\npart. The limb may be placed on pillows, or the foot of the bed raised\\non blocks, so that the ulcer lies on a higher level than the heart.\\nShould varicose veins be present, the question of operative treatment\\nmust be considered.\\n\\nWhen an _imperfect nerve supply_ is the main factor underlying ulcer\\nformation, prophylaxis is the chief consideration. In patients suffering\\nfrom spinal injuries or diseases, cerebral paralysis, or affections of\\nthe peripheral nerves, all sources of irritation, such as ill-fitting\\nsplints, tight bandages, moist applications, and hot bottles, should be\\navoided. Any part liable to pressure, from the position of the patient\\nor otherwise, must be carefully protected by pads of wool, air-cushions,\\nor water-bags, and must be kept absolutely dry. The skin should be\\nhardened by daily applications of methylated spirit.\\n\\nShould an ulcer form in spite of these precautions, the mildest\\nantiseptics must be employed for bathing and dressing it, and as far as\\npossible all dressings should be dry.\\n\\nThe _perforating ulcer_ of the foot calls for special treatment. To\\navoid pressure on the sole of the foot, the patient must be confined to\\nbed. As the main local obstacle to healing is the down-growth of\\nepithelium along the sides of the ulcer, this must be removed by the\\nknife or sharp spoon. The base also should be excised, and any bone\\nwhich may have become involved should be gouged away, so as to leave a\\nhealthy and vascular surface. The cavity thus formed is stuffed with\\nbismuth or iodoform gauze and encouraged to heal from the bottom. As the\\nparts are insensitive an anaesthetic is not required. After the ulcer has\\nhealed, the patient should wear in his boot a thick felt sole with a\\nhole cut out opposite the situation of the cicatrix. When a joint has\\nbeen opened into, the difficulty of thoroughly getting rid of all\\nunhealthy and infected granulations is so great that amputation may be\\nadvisable, but it is to be remembered that ulceration may recur in the\\nstump if pressure is put upon it. The treatment of any nervous disease\\nor glycosuria which may coexist is, of course, indicated.\\n\\nExposure of the plantar nerves by an incision behind the medial\\nmalleolus, and subjecting them to forcible stretching, has been employed\\nby Chipault and others in the treatment of perforating ulcers of the\\nfoot.\\n\\nThe ulcer that forms in relation to callosities on the sole of the foot\\nis treated by paring away all the thickened skin, after softening it\\nwith soda fomentations, removing the unhealthy granulations, and\\napplying stimulating dressings.\\n\\n_Treatment of Ulcers due to Constitutional Causes._--When ulcers are\\nassociated with such diseases as tuberculosis, syphilis, diabetes,\\nBright\\'s disease, scurvy, or gout, these must receive appropriate\\ntreatment.\\n\\nThe local treatment of the _tuberculous ulcer_ calls for special\\nmention. If the ulcer is of limited extent and situated on an exposed\\npart of the body, the most satisfactory method is complete removal, by\\nmeans of the knife, scissors, or sharp spoon, of the ulcerated surface\\nand of all the infected area around it, so as to leave a healthy surface\\nfrom which granulations may spring up. Should the raw surface left be\\nlikely to result in an unsightly scar or in cicatricial contraction,\\nskin-grafting should be employed.\\n\\nFor extensive ulcers on the limbs, the chest wall, or on other covered\\nparts, or when operative treatment is contra-indicated, the use of\\ntuberculin and exposure to the Rontgen rays have proved beneficial. The\\ninduction of passive hyperaemia, by Bier\\'s or by Klapp\\'s apparatus,\\nshould also be used, either alone or supplementary to other measures.\\n\\nNo ulcerative process responds so readily to medicinal treatment as the\\n_syphilitic ulcer_ does to the intra-venous administration of arsenical\\npreparations of the \"606\" or \"914\" groups or to full doses of iodide of\\npotassium and mercury, and the local application of black wash. When the\\nulceration has lasted for a long time, however, and is widespread and\\ndeep, the duration of treatment is materially shortened by a thorough\\nscraping with the sharp spoon.\\n\\n#Treatment in relation to the Condition of the Ulcer.#--_Ulcers in a\\nweak condition._--If the weak condition of the ulcer is due to anaemia\\nor kidney disease, these affections must first be treated. Locally, the\\nimperfect granulations should be scraped away, and some stimulating\\nagent applied to the raw surface to promote the growth of healthy\\ngranulations. For this purpose the sore may be covered with gauze\\nsmeared with a 6 to 8 per cent. ointment of scarlet-red, the surrounding\\nparts being protected from the irritant action of the scarlet-red by a\\nlayer of vaseline. A dressing of gauze moistened with eusol or of\\nboracic lint wrung out of red lotion (2 grains of sulphate of zinc, and\\n10 minims of compound tincture of lavender, to an ounce of water), and\\ncovered with a layer of gutta-percha tissue, is also useful.\\n\\nWhen the condition has resulted from the prolonged use of moist\\ndressings, these must be stopped, the redundant granulations clipped\\naway with scissors, the surface rubbed with silver nitrate or sulphate\\nof copper (blue-stone), and dry dressings applied.\\n\\nWhen the ulcer has assumed the characters of a healing sore, skin-grafts\\nmay be applied to hasten cicatrisation.\\n\\n_Ulcers in a callous condition_ call for treatment in three\\ndirections--(1) The infective element must be eliminated. When the ulcer\\nis foul, relays of charcoal poultices (three parts of linseed meal to\\none of charcoal), maintained for thirty-six to forty-eight hours, are\\nuseful as a preliminary step. The base of the ulcer and the thickened\\nedges should then be freely scraped with a sharp spoon, and the\\nresulting raw surface sponged over with undiluted carbolic acid or\\niodine, after which an antiseptic dressing is applied, and changed daily\\ntill healthy granulations appear. (2) The venous return must be\\nfacilitated by elevation of the limb and massage. (3) The induration of\\nthe surrounding parts must be got rid of before contraction of the sore\\nis possible. For this purpose the free application of blisters, as first\\nrecommended by Syme, leaves little to be desired. Liquor epispasticus\\npainted over the parts, or a large fly-blister (emplastrum cantharidis)\\napplied all round the ulcer, speedily disperses the inflammatory\\nproducts which cause the induration. The use of elastic pressure or of\\nstrapping, of hot-air baths, or the making of multiple incisions in the\\nskin around the ulcer, fulfils the same object.\\n\\nAs soon as the ulcer assumes the characters of a healing sore, it should\\nbe covered with skin-grafts, which furnish a much better cicatrix than\\nthat which forms when the ulcer is allowed to heal without such aid.\\n\\nA more radical method of treatment consists in excising the whole\\nulcer, including its edges and about a quarter of an inch of the\\nsurrounding tissue, as well as the underlying fibrous tissue, and\\ngrafting the raw surface.\\n\\n_Ambulatory Treatment._--When the circumstances of the patient forbid\\nhis lying up in bed, the healing of the ulcer is much delayed. He should\\nbe instructed to take every possible opportunity of placing the limb in\\nan elevated position, and must constantly wear a firm bandage of\\n_elastic webbing_. This webbing is porous and admits of evaporation of\\nthe skin and wound secretions--an advantage it has over Martin\\'s rubber\\nbandage. The bandage should extend from the toes to well above the knee,\\nand should always be applied while the patient is in the recumbent\\nposition with the leg elevated, preferably before getting out of bed in\\nthe morning. Additional support is given to the veins if the bandage is\\napplied as a figure of eight.\\n\\nWe have found the following method satisfactory in out-patient\\npractice. The patient lying on a couch, the limb is raised about\\neighteen inches and kept in this position for five minutes--till the\\nexcess of blood has left it. With the limb still raised, the ulcer with\\nthe surrounding skin is covered with a layer, about half an inch thick,\\nof finely powdered boracic acid, and the leg, from foot to knee,\\nexcluding the sole, is enveloped in a thick layer of wood-wool wadding.\\nThis is held in position by ordinary cotton bandages, painted over with\\nliquid starch; while the starch is drying the limb is kept elevated.\\nWith this appliance the patient may continue to work, and the dressing\\ndoes not require to be changed oftener than once in three or four weeks\\n(W. G. Richardson).\\n\\nWhen an ulcer becomes acutely _inflamed_ as a result of superadded\\ninfection, antiseptic measures are employed to overcome the infection,\\nand ichthyol or other soothing applications may be used to allay the\\npain.\\n\\nThe _phagedaenic ulcer_ calls for more energetic means of disinfection;\\nthe whole of the affected surface is touched with the actual cautery at\\na white heat, or is painted with pure carbolic acid. Relays of charcoal\\npoultices are then applied until the spread of the disease is arrested.\\n\\nFor the _irritable ulcer_ the most satisfactory treatment is complete\\nexcision and subsequent skin-grafting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nGANGRENE\\n\\n\\nDefinition--Types: _Dry_, _Moist_--Varieties--Gangrene primarily due to\\n    interference with circulation: _Senile gangrene_; _Embolic\\n    gangrene_; _Gangrene following ligation of arteries_; _Gangrene\\n    from mechanical causes_; _Gangrene from heat, chemical agents, and\\n    cold_; _Diabetic gangrene_; _Gangrene associated with spasm of\\n    blood vessels_; _Raynaud\\'s disease_; _Angio-sclerotic gangrene_;\\n    _Gangrene from ergot_. Bacterial varieties of gangrene.\\n    _Pathology_--clinical varieties--_Acute infective gangrene_;\\n    _Malignant oedema_; _Acute emphysematous_ or _gas gangrene_;\\n    _Cancrum oris_, _etc_. Bed-sores: _Acute_; _chronic_.\\n\\nGangrene or mortification is the process by which a portion of tissue\\ndies _en masse_, as distinguished from the molecular or cellular death\\nwhich constitutes ulceration. The dead portion is known as a _slough_.\\n\\nIn this chapter we shall confine our attention to the process as it\\naffects the limbs and superficial parts, leaving gangrene of the viscera\\nto be described in regional surgery.\\n\\n\\nTYPES OF GANGRENE\\n\\nTwo distinct types of gangrene are met with, which, from their most\\nobvious point of difference, are known respectively as _dry_ and\\n_moist_, and there are several clinical varieties of each type.\\n\\nSpeaking generally, it may be said that dry gangrene is essentially due\\nto a simple _interference with the blood supply_ of a part; while the\\nmain factor in the production of moist gangrene is _bacterial\\ninfection_.\\n\\nThe cardinal signs of gangrene are: change in the colour of the part,\\ncoldness, loss of sensation and motor power, and, lastly, loss of\\npulsation in the arteries.\\n\\n#Dry Gangrene# or #Mummification# is a comparatively slow form of local\\ndeath due, as a rule, to a diminution in the arterial blood supply of\\nthe affected part, resulting from such causes as the gradual narrowing\\nof the lumen of the arteries by disease of their coats, or the blocking\\nof the main vessel by an embolus.\\n\\nAs the fluids in the tissues are lost by evaporation the part becomes\\ndry and shrivelled, and as the skin is usually intact, infection does\\nnot take place, or if it does, the want of moisture renders the part an\\nunsuitable soil, and the organisms do not readily find a footing. Any\\nspread of the process that may take place is chiefly influenced by the\\nanatomical distribution of the blocked arteries, and is arrested as soon\\nas it reaches an area rich in anastomotic vessels. The dead portion is\\nthen cast off, the irritation resulting from the contact of the dead\\nwith the still living tissue inducing the formation of granulations on\\nthe proximal side of the junction, and these by slowly eating into the\\ndead portion produce a furrow--the _line of demarcation_--which\\ngradually deepens until complete separation is effected. As the muscles\\nand bones have a richer blood supply than the integument, the death of\\nskin and subcutaneous tissues extends higher than that of muscles and\\nbone, with the result that the stump left after spontaneous separation\\nis conical, the end of the bone projecting beyond the soft parts.\\n\\n_Clinical Features._--The part undergoing mortification becomes colder\\nthan normal, the temperature falling to that of the surrounding\\natmosphere. In many instances, but not in all, the onset of the process\\nis accompanied by severe neuralgic pain in the part, probably due to\\nanaemia of the nerves, to neuritis, or to the irritation of the exposed\\naxis cylinders by the dead and dying tissues around them. This pain soon\\nceases and gives place to a complete loss of sensation. The dead part\\nbecomes dry, horny, shrivelled, and semi-transparent--at first of a dark\\nbrown, but finally of a black colour, from the dissemination of blood\\npigment throughout the tissues. There is no putrefaction, and therefore\\nno putrid odour; and the condition being non-infective, there is not\\nnecessarily any constitutional disturbance. In itself, therefore, dry\\ngangrene does not involve immediate risk to life; the danger lies in the\\nfact that the breach of surface at the line of demarcation furnishes a\\npossible means of entrance for bacteria, which may lead to infective\\ncomplications.\\n\\n#Moist Gangrene# is an acute process, the dead part retaining its fluids\\nand so affording a favourable soil for the development of bacteria. The\\naction of the organisms and their toxins on the adjacent tissues leads\\nto a rapid and wide spread of the process. The skin becomes moist and\\nmacerated, and bullae, containing dark-coloured fluid or gases, form\\nunder the epidermis. The putrefactive gases evolved cause the skin to\\nbecome emphysematous and crepitant and produce an offensive odour. The\\ntissues assume a greenish-black colour from the formation in them of a\\nsulphide of iron resulting from decomposition of the blood pigment.\\nUnder certain conditions the dead part may undergo changes resembling\\nmore closely those of ordinary post-mortem decomposition. Owing to its\\nnature the spread of the gangrene is seldom arrested by the natural\\nprotective processes, and it usually continues until the condition\\nproves fatal from the absorption of toxins into the circulation.\\n\\nThe _clinical features_ vary in the different varieties of moist\\ngangrene, but the local results of bacterial action and the\\nconstitutional disturbance associated with toxin absorption are present\\nin all; the prognosis therefore is grave in the extreme.\\n\\nFrom what has been said, it will be gathered that in dry gangrene there\\nis no urgent call for operation to save the patient\\'s life, the primary\\nindication being to prevent the access of bacteria to the dead part, and\\nespecially to the surface exposed at the line of demarcation. In moist\\ngangrene, on the contrary, organisms having already obtained a footing,\\nimmediate removal of the dead and dying tissues, as a rule, offers the\\nonly hope of saving life.\\n\\n\\nVARIETIES OF GANGRENE\\n\\n#Varieties of Gangrene essentially due to Interference with the\\nCirculation#\\n\\nWhile the varieties of gangrene included in this group depend primarily\\non interference with the circulation, it is to be borne in mind that the\\nclinical course of the affection may be profoundly influenced by\\nsuperadded infection with micro-organisms. Although the bacteria do not\\nplay the most important part in producing tissue necrosis, their\\n\\nsubsequent introduction is an accident of such importance that it may\\nchange the whole aspect of affairs and convert a dry form of gangrene\\ninto one of the moist type. Moreover, the low state of vitality of the\\ntissues, and the extreme difficulty of securing and maintaining asepsis,\\nmake it a sequel of great frequency.\\n\\n#Senile Gangrene.#--Senile gangrene is the commonest example of local\\ndeath produced by a _gradual_ diminution in the quantity of blood\\npassing through the parts, as a result of arterio-sclerosis or other\\nchronic disease of the arteries leading to diminution of their calibre.\\nIt is the most characteristic example of the dry type of gangrene. As\\nthe term indicates, it occurs in old persons, but the patient\\'s age is\\nto be reckoned by the condition of his arteries rather than by the\\nnumber of his years. Thus the vessels of a comparatively young man who\\nhas suffered from syphilis and been addicted to alcohol are more liable\\nto atheromatous degeneration leading to this form of gangrene than are\\nthose of a much older man who has lived a regular and abstemious life.\\nThis form of gangrene is much more common in men than in women. While it\\nusually attacks only one foot, it is not uncommon for the other foot to\\nbe affected after an interval, and in some cases it is bilateral from\\nthe outset. It must clearly be understood that any form of gangrene may\\n\\noccur in old persons, the term senile being here restricted to that\\nvariety which results from arterio-sclerosis.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Senile Gangrene of the Foot, showing line of\\ndemarcation.]\\n\\n_Clinical Features._--The commonest seat of the disease is in the toes,\\nespecially the great toe, whence it spreads up the foot to the heel, or\\neven to the leg (Fig. 20). There is often a history of some slight\\ninjury preceding its onset. The vitality of the tissues is so low that\\nthe balance between life and death may be turned by the most trivial\\ninjury, such as a cut while paring a toe-nail or a corn, a blister\\ncaused by an ill-fitting shoe or the contact of a hot-bottle. In some\\ncases the actual gangrene is determined by thrombosis of the popliteal\\nor tibial arteries, which are already narrowed by obliterating\\nendarteritis.\\n\\nIt is common to find that the patient has been troubled for a long time\\nbefore the onset of definite signs of gangrene, with cold feet, with\\ntingling and loss of feeling, or a peculiar sensation as if walking on\\ncotton wool.\\n\\nThe first evidence of the death of the part varies in different cases.\\nSometimes a dark-blue spot appears on the medial side of the great toe\\nand gradually increases in size; or a blister containing blood-stained\\nfluid may form. Streaks or patches of dark-blue mottling appear higher\\nup on the foot or leg. In other cases a small sore surrounded by a\\ncongested areola forms in relation to the nail and refuses to heal. Such\\nsores on the toes of old persons are always to be looked upon with\\nsuspicion and treated with the greatest care; and the urine should be\\nexamined for sugar. There is often severe, deep-seated pain of a\\nneuralgic character, with cramps in the limb, and these may persist long\\nafter a line of demarcation has formed. The dying part loses sensibility\\nto touch and becomes cold and shrivelled.\\n\\nAll the physical appearances and clinical symptoms associated with dry\\ngangrene supervene, and the dead portion is delimited by a line of\\ndemarcation. If this forms slowly and irregularly it indicates a very\\nunsatisfactory condition of the circulation; while, if it forms quickly\\nand decidedly, the presumption is that the circulation in the parts\\nabove is fairly good. The separation of the dead part is always attended\\nwith the risk of infection taking place, and should this occur, the\\ntemperature rises and other evidences of toxaemia appear.\\n\\n_Prophylaxis._--The toes and feet of old people, the condition of whose\\ncirculation predisposes them to gangrene, should be protected from\\nslight injuries such as may be received while paring nails, cutting\\ncorns, or wearing ill-fitting boots. The patient should also be warned\\nof the risk of exposure to cold, the use of hot-bottles, and of placing\\nthe feet near a fire. Attempts have been made to improve the peripheral\\ncirculation by establishing an anastomosis between the main artery of a\\nlimb and its companion vein, so that arterial blood may reach the\\nperipheral capillaries--reversal of the circulation--but the clinical\\nresults have proved disappointing. (See _Op. Surg._, p. 29.)\\n\\n_Treatment._--When there is evidence that gangrene has occurred, the\\nfirst indication is to prevent infection by purifying the part, and\\nafter careful drying to wrap it in a thick layer of absorbent and\\nantiseptic wool, retained in place by a loosely applied bandage. A\\nslight degree of elevation of the limb is an advantage, but it must not\\nbe sufficient to diminish the amount of blood entering the part.\\nHot-bottles are to be used with the utmost caution. As absolute dryness\\nis essential, ointments or other greasy dressings are to be avoided, as\\nthey tend to prevent evaporation from the skin. Opium should be given\\nfreely to alleviate pain. Stimulation is to be avoided, and the patient\\nshould be carefully dieted.\\n\\nWhen the gangrene is limited to the toes in old and feeble patients,\\nsome surgeons advocate the expectant method of treatment, waiting for a\\nline of demarcation to form and allowing the dead part to be separated.\\nThis takes place so slowly, however, that it necessitates the patient\\nbeing laid up for many weeks, or even months; and we agree with the\\nmajority in advising early amputation.\\n\\nIn this connection it is worthy of note that there are certain points at\\nwhich gangrene naturally tends to become arrested--namely, at the highly\\nvascular areas in the neighbourhood of joints. Thus gangrene of the\\ngreat toe often stops when it reaches the metatarso-phalangeal joint; or\\nif it trespasses this limit it may be arrested either at the\\ntarso-metatarsal or at the ankle joint. If these be passed, it usually\\nspreads up the leg to just below the knee before signs of arrestment\\nappear. Further, it is seen from pathological specimens that the spread\\nis greater on the dorsal than on the plantar aspect, and that the death\\nof skin and subcutaneous tissues extends higher than that of bone and\\nmuscle.\\n\\nThese facts furnish us with indications as to the seat and method of\\namputation. Experience has proved that in senile gangrene of the lower\\nextremity the most reliable and satisfactory results are obtained by\\namputating in the region of the knee, care being taken to perform the\\noperation so as to leave the prepatellar anastomosis intact by retaining\\nthe patella in the anterior flap. The most satisfactory operation in\\nthese cases is Gritti\\'s supra-condylar amputation. Haemorrhage is easily\\ncontrolled by digital pressure, and the use of a tourniquet should be\\ndispensed with, as the constriction of the limb is liable to interfere\\nwith the vitality of the flaps.\\n\\nWhen the tibial vessels can be felt pulsating at the ankle it may be\\njustifiable, if the patient urgently desires it, to amputate lower than\\nthe knee; but there is considerable risk of gangrene recurring in the\\nstump and necessitating a second operation.\\n\\nThat amputation for senile gangrene performed between the ankle and the\\nknee seldom succeeds, is explained by the fact that the vascular\\nobstruction is usually in the upper part of the posterior tibial artery,\\nand the operation is therefore performed through tissues with an\\ninadequate blood supply. It is not uncommon, indeed, on amputating above\\nthe knee, to find even the popliteal artery plugged by a clot. This\\nshould be removed at the amputation by squeezing the vessel from above\\ndownward by a \"milking\" movement, or by \"catheterising the artery\" with\\nthe aid of a cannula with a terminal aperture.\\n\\nIt is to be borne in mind that the object of amputation in these cases\\nis merely to remove the gangrenous part, and so relieve the patient of\\nthe discomfort and the risks from infection which its presence involves.\\nWhile it is true that in many of these patients the operation is borne\\nremarkably well, it must be borne in mind that those who suffer from\\nsenile gangrene are of necessity bad lives, and a guarded opinion should\\nbe expressed as to the prospects of survival. The possibility of the\\ndisease developing in the other limb has already been referred to.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Embolic Gangrene of Hand and Arm.]\\n\\n#Embolic Gangrene# (Fig. 21).--This is the most typical form of gangrene\\nresulting from the _sudden_ occlusion of the main artery of a part,\\nwhether by the impaction of an embolus or the formation of a thrombus in\\nits lumen, when the collateral circulation is not sufficiently free to\\nmaintain the vitality of the tissues.\\n\\nThere is sudden pain at the site of impaction of the embolus, and the\\npulses beyond are lost. The limb becomes cold, numb, insensitive, and\\npowerless. It is often pale at first--hence the term \"white gangrene\"\\nsometimes applicable to the early appearances, which closely resemble\\nthose presented by the limb of a corpse.\\n\\nIf the part is aseptic it shrivels, and presents the ordinary features\\nof dry gangrene. It is liable, however, especially in the lower\\nextremity and when the veins also are obstructed, to become infected and\\nto assume the characters of the moist type.\\n\\nThe extent of the gangrene depends upon the site of impaction of the\\nembolus, thus if the _abdominal aorta_ becomes suddenly occluded by an\\nembolus at its bifurcation, the obstruction of the iliacs and femorals\\ninduces symmetrical gangrene of both extremities as high as the inguinal\\nligaments. When gangrene follows occlusion of the _external iliac_ or of\\nthe _femoral artery_ above the origin of its deep branch, the death of\\nthe limb extends as high as the middle or upper third of the thigh. When\\nthe _femoral_ below the origin of its deep branch or the _popliteal\\nartery_ is obstructed, the veins remaining pervious, the anastomosis\\nthrough the profunda is sufficient to maintain the vascular supply, and\\ngangrene does not necessarily follow. The rupture of a popliteal\\naneurysm, however, by compressing the vein and the articular branches,\\nusually determines gangrene. When an embolus becomes impacted at the\\n_bifurcation of the popliteal_, if gangrene ensues it usually spreads\\nwell up the leg.\\n\\nWhen the _axillary artery_ is the seat of embolic impaction, and\\ngangrene ensues, the process usually reaches the middle of the upper\\narm. Gangrene following the blocking of the _brachial_ at its\\nbifurcation usually extends as far as the junction of the lower and\\nmiddle thirds of the forearm.\\n\\nGangrene due to thrombosis or embolism is sometimes met with in patients\\nrecovering from typhus, typhoid, or other fevers, such as that\\nassociated with child-bed. It occurs in peripheral parts, such as the\\ntoes, fingers, nose, or ears.\\n\\n_Treatment._--The general treatment of embolic gangrene is the same as\\nthat for the senile form. Success has followed opening the artery and\\nremoving the embolus. The artery is exposed at the seat of impaction\\nand, having been clamped above and below, a longitudinal opening is made\\nand the clot carefully extracted with the aid of forceps; it is\\nsometimes unexpectedly long (one recorded from the femoral artery\\nmeasured nearly 34 inches); the wound in the artery is then sewn up with\\nfine silk soaked in paraffin. When amputation is indicated, it must be\\nperformed sufficiently high to ensure a free vascular supply to the\\nflaps.\\n\\n#Gangrene following Ligation of Arteries.#--After the ligation of an\\nartery in its continuity--for example, in the treatment of aneurysm--the\\nlimb may for some days remain in a condition verging on gangrene, the\\ndistal parts being cold, devoid of sensation, and powerless. As the\\ncollateral circulation is established, the vitality of the tissues is\\ngradually restored and these symptoms pass off. In some cases,\\nhowever,--and especially in the lower extremity--gangrene ensues and\\npresents the same characters as those resulting from embolism. It tends\\nto be of the dry type. The occlusion of the vein as well as the artery\\nis not found to increase the risk of gangrene.\\n\\n#Gangrene from Mechanical Constriction of the Vessels of the part.#--The\\napplication of a bandage or plaster-of-Paris case too tightly, or of a\\ntourniquet for too long a time, has been known to lead to death of the\\npart beyond; but such cases are rare, as are also those due to the\\npressure of a fractured bone or of a tumour on a large artery or vein.\\nWhen gangrene occurs from such causes, it tends to be of the moist type.\\n\\nMuch commoner is it to meet with localised areas of necrosis due to the\\nexcessive _pressure of splints_ over bony prominences, such as the\\nlateral malleolus, the medial condyle of the humerus, or femur, or over\\nthe dorsum of the foot. This is especially liable to occur when the\\nnutrition of the skin is depressed by any interference with its\\nnerve-supply, such as follows injuries to the spine or peripheral\\nnerves, disease of the brain, or acute anterior poliomyelitis. When the\\nsplint is removed the skin pressed upon is found to be of a pale yellow\\nor grey colour, and is surrounded by a ring of hyperaemia. If protected\\nfrom infection, the clinical course is that of dry gangrene.\\n\\nBed-sores, which are closely allied to pressure sores, will be described\\nat the end of this chapter.\\n\\nWhen a localised portion of tissue, for example, a piece of skin, is so\\nseverely _crushed_ or _bruised_ that its blood vessels are occluded and\\nits structure destroyed, it dies, and, if not infected with bacteria,\\ndries up, and the shrivelled brown skin is slowly separated by the\\ngrowth of granulation tissue beneath and around it.\\n\\nFingers, toes, or even considerable portions of limbs may in the same\\nway be suddenly destroyed by severe trauma, and undergo mummification.\\nIf organisms gain access, typical moist gangrene may ensue, or changes\\nsimilar to those of ordinary post-mortem decomposition may take place.\\n\\n_Treatment._--The first indication is to exclude bacteria by purifying\\nthe damaged part and its surroundings, and applying dry, non-irritating\\ndressings.\\n\\nWhen these measures are successful, dry gangrene ensues. The raw surface\\nleft after the separation of the dead skin may be allowed to heal by\\ngranulation, or may be covered by skin-grafts. In the case of a finger\\nor a limb it is not necessary to wait until spontaneous separation takes\\nplace, as this is often a slow process. When a well-marked line of\\ndemarcation has formed, amputation may be performed just sufficiently\\nfar above it to enable suitable flaps to be made.\\n\\nThe end of a stump, after spontaneous separation of the gangrenous\\nportion, requires to be trimmed, sufficient bone being removed to permit\\nof the soft parts coming together.\\n\\nIf moist gangrene supervenes, amputation must be performed without\\ndelay, and at a higher level.\\n\\n#Gangrene from Heat, Chemical Agents, and Cold.#--Severe #burns# and\\n#scalds# may be followed by necrosis of tissue. So long as the parts are\\nkept absolutely dry--as, for example, by the picric acid method of\\ntreatment--the grossly damaged portions of tissue undergo dry gangrene;\\nbut when wet or oily dressings are applied and organisms gain access,\\nmoist gangrene follows.\\n\\nStrong #chemical agents#, such as caustic potash, nitric or sulphuric\\nacid, may also induce local tissue necrosis, the general appearances of\\nthe lesions produced being like those of severe burns. The resulting\\nsloughs are slow to separate, and leave deep punched-out cavities which\\nare long of healing.\\n\\n#Carbolic Gangrene.#--Carbolic acid, even in comparatively weak\\nsolution, is liable to induce dry gangrene when applied as a fomentation\\nto a finger, especially in women and children. Thrombosis occurs in the\\nblood vessels of the part, which at first is pale and soft, but later\\nbecomes dark and leathery. On account of the anaesthetic action of\\ncarbolic acid, the onset of the process is painless, and the patient\\ndoes not realise his danger. A line of demarcation soon forms, but the\\ndead part separates very slowly.\\n\\n#Gangrene from Frost-bite.#--It is difficult to draw the line between\\nthe third degree of chilblain and the milder forms of true frost-bite;\\nthe difference is merely one of degree. Frost-bite affects chiefly the\\ntoes and fingers--especially the great toe and the little finger--the\\nears, and the nose. In this country it is seldom seen except in members\\nof the tramp class, who, in addition to being exposed to cold by\\nsleeping in the open air, are ill-fed and generally debilitated. The\\ncondition usually manifests itself after the parts, having been\\nsubjected to extreme cold, are brought into warm surroundings. The first\\nsymptom is numbness in the part, followed by a sense of weight,\\ntingling, and finally by complete loss of sensation. The part attacked\\nbecomes white and bleached-looking, feels icy cold, and is insensitive\\nto touch. Either immediately, or, it may be, not for several days, it\\nbecomes discoloured and swollen, and finally contracts and shrivels.\\nAbove the dead area the limb may be the seat of excruciating pain. The\\ndead portion is cast off, as in other forms of dry gangrene, by the\\nformation of a line of demarcation.\\n\\nTo prevent the occurrence of gangrene from frost-bite it is necessary to\\navoid the sudden application of heat. The patient should be placed in a\\ncold room, and the part rubbed with snow, or put in a cold bath, and\\nhave light friction applied to it. As the circulation is restored the\\ngeneral surroundings and the local applications are gradually made\\nwarmer. Elevation of the part, wrapping it in cotton wool, and removal\\nto a warmer room, are then permissible, and stimulants and warm drinks\\nmay be given with caution. When by these means the occurrence of\\ngangrene is averted, recovery ensues, its onset being indicated by the\\nwhite parts assuming a livid red hue and becoming the seat of an acute\\nburning sensation.\\n\\nA condition known as _Trench feet_ was widely prevalent amongst the\\ntroops in France during the European War. Although allied to frost-bite,\\ncold appears to play a less important part in its causation than\\nhumidity and constriction of the limbs producing ischaemia of the feet.\\nChanges were found in the endothelium of the blood vessels, the axis\\ncylinders of nerves, and the muscles. The condition does not occur in\\ncivil life.\\n\\n#Diabetic Gangrene.#--This form of gangrene is prone to occur in persons\\nover fifty years of age who suffer from glycosuria. The arteries are\\noften markedly diseased. In some cases the existence of the glycosuria\\nis unsuspected before the onset of the gangrene, and it is only on\\nexamining the urine that the cause of the condition is discovered. The\\ngangrenous process seldom begins as suddenly as that associated with\\nembolism, and, like senile gangrene, which it may closely simulate in\\nits early stages, it not infrequently begins after a slight injury to\\none of the toes. It but rarely, however, assumes the dry, shrivelling\\ntype, as a rule being attended with swelling, oedema, and dusky redness\\nof the foot, and severe pain. According to Paget, the dead part remains\\nwarm longer than in other forms of senile gangrene; there is a greater\\ntendency for patches of skin at some distance from the primary seat of\\ndisease to become gangrenous, and for the death of tissue to extend\\nupwards in the subcutaneous planes, leaving the overlying skin\\nunaffected. The low vitality of the tissues favours the growth of\\nbacteria, and if these gain access, the gangrene assumes the characters\\nof the moist type and spreads rapidly.\\n\\nThe rules for amputation are the same as those governing the treatment\\nof senile gangrene, the level at which the limb is removed depending\\nupon whether the gangrene is of the dry or moist type. The general\\ntreatment for diabetes must, of course, be employed whether amputation\\nis performed or not. Paget recommended that the dietetic treatment\\nshould not be so rigid as in uncomplicated diabetes, and that opium\\nshould be given freely.\\n\\nThe _prognosis_ even after amputation is unfavourable. In many cases the\\npatient dies with symptoms of diabetic coma within a few days of the\\noperation; or, if he survives this, he may eventually succumb to\\ndiabetes. In others there is sloughing of the flaps and death results\\nfrom toxaemia. Occasionally the other limb becomes gangrenous. On the\\nother hand, the glycosuria may diminish or may even disappear after\\namputation.\\n\\n#Gangrene associated with Spasm of Blood Vessels.#--#Raynaud\\'s Disease#,\\nor symmetrical gangrene, is supposed to be due to spasm of the\\narterioles, resulting from peripheral neuritis. It occurs oftenest in\\nwomen, between the ages of eighteen and thirty, who are the subjects of\\nuterine disorders, anaemia, or chlorosis. Cold is an aggravating factor,\\nas the disease is commonest during the winter months. The digits of both\\nhands or the toes of both feet are simultaneously attacked, and the\\ndisease seldom spreads beyond the phalanges or deeper than the skin.\\n\\nThe first evidence is that the fingers become cold, white, and\\ninsensitive to touch and pain. These attacks of _local syncope_ recur at\\nvarying intervals for months or even years. They last for a few minutes\\nor even for some hours, and as they pass off the parts become hyperaemic\\nand painful.\\n\\nA more advanced stage of the disease is known as _local asphyxia_. The\\ncirculation through the fingers becomes exceedingly sluggish, and the\\nparts assume a dull, livid hue. There is swelling and burning or\\nshooting pain. This may pass off in a few days, or may increase in\\nseverity, with the formation of bullae, and end in dry gangrene. As a\\nrule, the slough which forms is comparatively small and superficial,\\nbut it may take some months to separate. The condition tends to recur in\\nsuccessive winters.\\n\\nThe _treatment_ consists in remedying any nervous or uterine disorder\\nthat may be present, keeping the parts warm by wrapping them in cotton\\nwool, and in the use of hot-air or electric baths, the parts being\\nimmersed in water through which a constant current is passed. When\\ngangrene occurs, it is treated on the same lines as other forms of dry\\ngangrene, but if amputation is called for it is only with a view to\\nremoving the dead part.\\n\\n#Angio-sclerotic Gangrene.#--A form of gangrene due to _angio-sclerosis_\\nis occasionally met with in young persons, even in children. It bears\\ncertain analogies to Raynaud\\'s disease in that spasm of the vessels\\nplays a part in determining the local death.\\n\\nThe main arteries are narrowed by hyperplastic endarteritis followed by\\nthrombosis, and similar changes are found in the veins. The condition is\\nusually met with in the feet, but the upper extremity may be affected,\\nand is attended with very severe pain, rendering sleep impossible.\\n\\nThe patient is liable to sudden attacks of numbness, tingling and\\nweakness of the limbs which pass off with rest--_intermittent\\nclaudication_. During these attacks the large arteries--femoral,\\nbrachial, and subclavian--can be felt as firm cords, while pulsation is\\nlost in the peripheral vessels. Gangrene eventually ensues, is attended\\nwith great pain and runs a slow course. It is treated on the same lines\\nas Raynaud\\'s disease.\\n\\n#Gangrene from Ergot.#--Gangrene may occur from interference with blood\\nsupply, the result of tetanic contraction of the minute vessels, such as\\nresults in ill-nourished persons who eat large quantities of coarse rye\\nbread contaminated with the _claviceps purpurea_ and containing the\\nergot of rye. It has also occurred in the fingers of patients who have\\ntaken ergot medicinally over long periods. The gangrene, which attacks\\nthe toes, fingers, ears, or nose, is preceded by formication, numbness,\\nand pains in the parts to be affected, and is of the dry variety.\\n\\nIn this country it is usually met with in sailors off foreign ships,\\nwhose dietary largely consists of rye bread. Trivial injuries may be the\\nstarting-point, the anaesthesia produced by the ergotin preventing the\\npatient taking notice of them. Alcoholism is a potent predisposing\\ncause.\\n\\nAs it is impossible to predict how far the process will spread, it is\\nadvisable to wait for the formation of a line of demarcation before\\noperating, and then to amputate immediately above the dead part.\\n\\n\\nBACTERIAL VARIETIES OF GANGRENE\\n\\nThe acute bacillary forms of gangrene all assume the moist type from the\\nfirst, and, spreading rapidly, result in extensive necrosis of tissue,\\nand often end fatally.\\n\\nThe infection is usually a mixed one in which anaerobic bacteria\\npredominate. The anaerobe most constantly present is the _bacillus\\naerogenes capsulatus_, usually in association with other anaerobes, and\\nsometimes with pyogenic diplo- and streptococci. According to the mode of\\naction of the associated organisms and the combined effects of their\\ntoxins on the tissues, the gangrenous process presents different\\npathological and clinical features. Some combinations, for example,\\nresult in a rapidly spreading cellulitis with early necrosis of\\nconnective tissue accompanied by thrombosis throughout the capillary and\\nvenous circulation of the parts implicated; other combinations cause\\ngreat oedema of the part, and others again lead to the formation of gases\\nin the tissues, particularly in the muscles.\\n\\nThese different effects do not appear to be due to a specific action of\\nany one of the organisms present, but to the combined effect of a\\nparticular group living in symbiosis.\\n\\nAccording as the cellulitic, the oedematous, or the gaseous\\ncharacteristics predominate, the clinical varieties of bacillary\\ngangrene may be separately described, but it must be clearly understood\\nthat they frequently overlap and cannot always be distinguished from one\\nanother.\\n\\n#Clinical Varieties of Bacillary Gangrene.#--#Acute infective gangrene#\\nis the form most commonly met with in civil practice. It may follow such\\ntrivial injuries as a pin-prick or a scratch, the signs of acute\\ncellulitis rapidly giving place to those of a spreading gangrene. Or it\\nmay ensue on a severe railway, machinery, or street accident, when\\nlacerated and bruised tissues are contaminated with gross dirt. Often\\nwithin a few hours of the injury the whole part rapidly becomes painful,\\nswollen, oedematous, and tense. The skin is at first glazed, and perhaps\\npaler than normal, but soon assumes a dull red or purplish hue, and\\nbullae form on the surface. Putrefactive gases may be evolved in the\\ntissues, and their presence is indicated by emphysematous crackling when\\nthe part is handled. The spread of the disease is so rapid that its\\nprogress is quite visible from hour to hour, and may be traced by the\\noccurrence of red lines along the course of the lymphatics of the limb.\\nIn the most acute cases the death of the affected part takes place so\\nrapidly that the local changes indicative of gangrene have not time to\\noccur, and the fact that the part is dead may be overlooked.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Gangrene of Terminal Phalanx of Index-Finger,\\nfollowing cellulitis of hand resulting from a scratch on the palm of the\\nhand.]\\n\\nRigors may occur, but the temperature is not necessarily raised--indeed,\\nit is sometimes subnormal. The pulse is small, feeble, rapid, and\\nirregular. Unless amputation is promptly performed, death usually\\nfollows within thirty-six or forty-eight hours. Even early operation\\ndoes not always avert the fatal issue, because the quantity of toxin\\nabsorbed and its extreme virulence are often more than even a robust\\nsubject can outlive.\\n\\n_Treatment._--Every effort must be made to purify all such wounds as are\\ncontaminated by earth, street dust, stable refuse, or other forms of\\ngross dirt. Devitalised and contaminated tissue is removed with the\\nknife or scissors and the wound purified with antiseptics of the\\nchlorine group or with hydrogen peroxide. If there is a reasonable\\nprospect that infection has been overcome, the wound may be at once\\nsutured, but if this is doubtful it is left open and packed or\\nirrigated.\\n\\nWhen acute gangrene has set in no treatment short of amputation is of\\nany avail, and the sooner this is done, the greater is the hope of\\nsaving the patient. The limb must be amputated well beyond the apparent\\nlimits of the infected area, and stringent precautions must be taken to\\navoid discharge from the already gangrenous area reaching the operation\\nwound. An assistant or nurse, who is to take no other part in the\\noperation, is told off to carry out the preliminary purification, and to\\nhold the limb during the operation.\\n\\n#Malignant Oedema.#--This form of acute gangrene has been defined as\\n\"a spreading inflammatory oedema attended with emphysema, and ultimately\\nfollowed by gangrene of the skin and adjacent parts.\" The predominant\\norganism is the _bacillus of malignant oedema_ or _vibrion septique_ of\\nPasteur, which is found in garden soil, dung, and various putrefying\\nsubstances. It is anaerobic, and occurs as long, thick rods with\\nsomewhat rounded ends and several laterally placed flagella. Spores,\\nwhich have a high power of resistance, form in the centre of the rods,\\nand bulge out the sides so as to give the organisms a spindle-shaped\\noutline. Other pathogenic organisms are also present and aid the\\nspecific bacillus in its action.\\n\\nAt the bedside it is difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish it\\nfrom acute infective gangrene. Both follow on the same kinds of injury\\nand run an exceedingly rapid course. In malignant oedema, however, the\\nincidence of the disease is mainly on the superficial parts, which\\nbecome oedematous and emphysematous, and acquire a marbled appearance\\nwith the veins clearly outlined. Early disappearance of sensation is a\\nparticularly grave symptom. Bullae form on the skin, and the tissues\\nhave \"a peculiar heavy but not putrid odour.\" The constitutional effects\\nare extremely severe, and death may ensue within a few hours.\\n\\n#Acute Emphysematous# or #Gas Gangrene# was prevalent in certain areas\\nat various periods during the European War. It follows infection of\\nlacerated wounds with the _bacillus aerogenes capsulatus_, usually in\\ncombination with other anaerobes, and its main incidence is on the\\nmuscles, which rapidly become infiltrated with gas that spreads\\nthroughout the whole extent of the muscle, disintegrating its fibres and\\nleading to necrosis. The gangrenous process spreads with appalling\\nrapidity, the limb becoming enormously swollen, painful, and crepitant\\nor even tympanitic. Patches of coppery or purple colour appear on the\\nskin, and bullae containing blood-stained serum form on the surface. The\\ntoxaemia is profound, and the face and lips assume a characteristic\\ncyanosis. The condition is attended with a high mortality. Only in the\\nearly stages and when the infection is limited are local measures\\nsuccessful in arresting the spread; in more severe cases amputation is\\nthe only means of saving life.\\n\\n#Cancrum Oris# or #Noma#.--This disease is believed to be due to a\\nspecific bacillus, which occurs in long delicate rods, and is chiefly\\nfound at the margin of the gangrenous area. It is prone to attack\\nunhealthy children from two to five years of age, especially during\\ntheir convalescence from such diseases as measles, scarlet fever, or\\ntyphoid, but may attack adults when they are debilitated. It is most\\ncommon in the mouth, but sometimes occurs on the vulva. In the mouth it\\nbegins as an ulcerative stomatitis, more especially affecting the gums\\nor inner aspect of the cheek. The child lies prostrated, and from the\\nopen mouth foul-smelling saliva, streaked with blood, escapes; the face\\nis of an ashy-grey colour, the lips dark and swollen. On the inner\\naspect of the cheek is a deeply ulcerated surface, with sloughy shreds\\nof dark-brown or black tissue covering its base; the edges are\\nirregular, firm, and swollen, and the surrounding mucous membrane is\\ninfiltrated and oedematous. In the course of a few hours a dark spot\\nappears on the outer aspect of the cheek, and rapidly increases in size;\\ntowards the centre it is black, shading off through blue and grey into a\\ndark-red area which extends over the cheek (Fig. 23). The tissue\\nimplicated is at first firm and indurated, but as it loses its vitality\\nit becomes doughy and sodden. Finally a slough forms, and, when it\\nseparates, the cheek is perforated.\\n\\nMeanwhile the process spreads inside the mouth, and the gums, the floor\\nof the mouth, or even the jaws, may become gangrenous and the teeth fall\\nout. The constitutional disturbance is severe, the temperature raised,\\nand the pulse feeble and rapid.\\n\\nThe extremely foetid odour which pervades the room or even the house the\\npatient occupies, is usually sufficient to suggest the diagnosis of\\ncancrum oris. The odour must not be mistaken for that due to\\ndecomposition of sordes on the teeth and gums of a debilitated patient.\\n\\nThe _prognosis_ is always grave in the extreme, the main risks being\\ngeneral toxaemia and septic pneumonia. When recovery takes place there is\\nserious deformity, and considerable portions of the jaws may be lost by\\nnecrosis.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Cancrum oris.\\n\\n(From a photograph lent by Sir George T. Beatson.)]\\n\\n_Treatment._--The only satisfactory treatment is thorough removal under\\nan anaesthetic of all the sloughy tissue, with the surrounding zone in\\nwhich the organisms are active. This is most efficiently accomplished by\\nthe knife or scissors, cutting until the tissue bleeds freely, after\\nwhich the raw surface is painted with undiluted carbolic acid and\\ndressed with iodoform gauze. It may be necessary to remove large pieces\\nof bone when the necrotic process has implicated the jaws. The mouth\\nmust be constantly sprayed with peroxide of hydrogen, and washed out\\nwith a disinfectant and deodorant lotion, such as Condy\\'s fluid. The\\npatient\\'s general condition calls for free stimulation.\\n\\nThe deformity resulting from these necessarily heroic measures is not so\\ngreat as might be expected, and can be further diminished by plastic\\noperations, which should be undertaken before cicatricial contraction\\nhas occurred.\\n\\n\\nBED-SORES\\n\\nBed-sores are most frequently met with in old and debilitated patients,\\nor in those whose tissues are devitalised by acute or chronic diseases\\nassociated with stagnation of blood in the peripheral veins. Any\\ninterference with the nerve-supply of the skin, whether from injury or\\ndisease of the central nervous system or of the peripheral nerves,\\nstrongly predisposes to the formation of bed-sores. Prolonged and\\nexcessive pressure over a bony prominence, especially if the parts be\\nmoist with skin secretions, urine, or wound discharges, determines the\\nformation of a sore. Excoriations, which may develop into true\\nbed-sores, sometimes form where two skin surfaces remain constantly\\napposed, as in the region of the scrotum or labium, under pendulous\\nmammae, or between fingers or toes confined in a splint.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Acute Bed-Sores over Right Buttock.]\\n\\n_Clinical Features._--Two clinical varieties are met with--the acute\\nand the chronic bed-sore.\\n\\nThe _acute_ bed-sore usually occurs over the sacrum or buttock. It\\ndevelops rapidly after spinal injuries and in the course of certain\\nbrain diseases. The part affected becomes red and congested, while the\\nsurrounding parts are oedematous and swollen, blisters form, and the skin\\nloses its vitality (Fig. 24).\\n\\nIn advanced cases of general paralysis of the insane, a peculiar form of\\nacute bed-sore beginning as a blister, and passing on to the formation\\nof a black, dry eschar, which slowly separates, occurs on such parts as\\nthe medial side of the knee, the angle of the scapula, and the heel.\\n\\nThe _chronic_ bed-sore begins as a dusky reddish purple patch, which\\ngradually becomes darker till it is almost black. The parts around are\\noedematous, and a blister may form. This bursts and exposes the papillae\\nof the skin, which are of a greenish hue. A tough greyish-black slough\\nforms, and is slowly separated. It is not uncommon for the gangrenous\\narea to continue to spread both in width and in depth till it reaches\\nthe periosteum or bone. Bed-sores over the sacrum sometimes implicate\\nthe vertebral canal and lead to spinal meningitis, which usually proves\\nfatal.\\n\\nIn old and debilitated patients the septic absorption taking place from\\na bed-sore often proves a serious complication of other surgical\\nconditions. From this cause, for example, old people may succumb during\\nthe treatment of a fractured thigh.\\n\\nThe granulating surface left on the separation of the slough tends to\\nheal comparatively rapidly.\\n\\n_Prevention of Bed-sores._--The first essential in the prevention of\\nbed-sores is the regular changing of the patient\\'s position, so that no\\none part of the body is continuously pressed upon for any length of\\ntime. Ring-pads of wool, air-cushions, or water-beds are necessary to\\nremove pressure from prominent parts. Absolute dryness of the skin is\\nall-important. At least once a day, the sacrum, buttocks,\\nshoulder-blades, heels, elbows, malleoli, or other parts exposed to\\npressure, must be sponged with soap and water, thoroughly dried, and\\nthen rubbed with methylated spirit, which is allowed to dry on the skin.\\nDusting the part with boracic acid powder not only keeps it dry, but\\nprevents the development of bacteria in the skin secretions.\\n\\nIn operation cases, care must be taken that irritating chemicals used to\\npurify the skin do not collect under the patient and remain in contact\\nwith the skin of the sacrum and buttocks during the time he is on the\\noperating-table. There is reason to believe that the so-called\\n\"post-operation bed-sore\" may be due to such causes. A similar result\\nhas been known to follow soiling of the sheets by the escape of a\\nturpentine enema.\\n\\n_Treatment._--Once a bed-sore has formed, every effort must be made to\\nprevent its spread. Alcohol is used to cleanse the broken surface, and\\ndry absorbent dressings are applied and frequently changed. It is\\nsometimes found necessary to employ moist or oily substances, such as\\nboracic poultices, eucalyptus ointment, or balsam of Peru, to facilitate\\nthe separation of sloughs, or to promote the growth of granulations. In\\npatients who are not extremely debilitated the slough may be excised,\\nthe raw surface scraped, and then painted with iodine.\\n\\nSkin-grafting is sometimes useful in covering in the large raw surface\\nleft after separation or removal of sloughs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nBACTERIAL AND OTHER WOUND INFECTIONS\\n\\n\\n_Erysipelas_--_Diphtheria_--_Tetanus_--_Hydrophobia_--_Anthrax_--\\n    _Glanders_--_Actinomycosis_--_Mycetoma_--_Delhi\\n    boil_--_Chigoe_--_Poisoning by insects_--_Snake-bites_.\\n\\n\\nERYSIPELAS\\n\\nErysipelas, popularly known as \"rose,\" is an acute spreading infective\\ndisease of the skin or of a mucous membrane due to the action of a\\nstreptococcus. Infection invariably takes place through an abrasion of\\nthe surface, although this may be so slight that it escapes observation\\neven when sought for. The streptococci are found most abundantly in the\\nlymph spaces just beyond the swollen margin of the inflammatory area,\\nand in the serous blebs which sometimes form on the surface.\\n\\n#Clinical Features.#--_Facial erysipelas_ is the commonest clinical\\nvariety, infection usually occurring through some slight abrasion in the\\nregion of the mouth or nose, or from an operation wound in this area.\\nFrom this point of origin the inflammation may spread all over the face\\nand scalp as far back as the nape of the neck. It stops, however, at the\\nchin, and never extends on to the front of the neck. There is great\\noedema of the face, the eyes becoming closed up, and the features\\nunrecognisable. The inflammation may spread to the meninges, the\\nintracranial venous sinuses, the eye, or the ear. In some cases the\\nerysipelas invades the mucous membrane of the mouth, and spreads to the\\nfauces and larynx, setting up an oedema of the glottis which may prove\\ndangerous to life.\\n\\nErysipelas occasionally attacks an operation wound that has become\\nseptic; and it may accompany septic infection of the genital tract in\\npuerperal women, or the separation of the umbilical cord in infants\\n(_erysipelas neonatorum_). After an incubation period, which varies from\\nfifteen to sixty hours, the patient complains of headache, pains in the\\nback and limbs, loss of appetite, nausea, and frequently there is\\nvomiting. He has a chill or slight rigor, initiating a rise of\\ntemperature to 103 o, 104 o, or 105 o F.; and a full bounding pulse of\\nabout 100 (Fig. 25). The tongue is foul, the breath heavy, and, as a\\nrule, the bowels are constipated. There is frequently albuminuria, and\\noccasionally nocturnal delirium. A moderate degree of leucocytosis\\n(15,000 to 20,000) is usually present.\\n\\nAround the seat of inoculation a diffuse red patch forms, varying in hue\\nfrom a bright scarlet to a dull brick-red. The edges are slightly raised\\nabove the level of the surrounding skin, as may readily be recognised by\\ngently stroking the part from the healthy towards the affected area. The\\nskin is smooth, tense, and glossy, and presents here and there blisters\\nfilled with serous fluid. The local temperature is raised, and the part\\nis the seat of a burning sensation and is tender to the touch, the most\\ntender area being the actively spreading zone which lies about half an\\ninch beyond the red margin.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Chart of Erysipelas occurring in a wound.]\\n\\nThe disease tends to spread spasmodically and irregularly, and the\\ndirection and extent of its progress may be recognised by mapping out\\nthe peripheral zone of tenderness. Red streaks appear along the lines of\\nthe superficial lymph vessels, and the deep lymphatics may sometimes be\\npalpated as firm, tender cords. The neighbouring glands, also, are\\ngenerally enlarged and tender.\\n\\nThe disease lasts for from two or three days to as many weeks, and\\nrelapses are frequent. Spontaneous resolution usually takes place, but\\nthe disease may prove fatal from absorption of toxins, involvement of\\nthe brain or meninges, or from general streptococcal infection.\\n\\n#Complications.#--_Diffuse suppurative cellulitis_ is the most serious\\nlocal complication, and results from a mixed infection with other\\npyogenic bacteria. Small _localised superficial abscesses_ may form\\nduring the convalescent stage. They are doubtless due to the action of\\nskin bacteria, which attack the tissues devitalised by the erysipelas. A\\npersistent form of _oedema_ sometimes remains after recurrent attacks of\\nerysipelas, especially when they affect the face or the lower extremity,\\na condition which is referred to with elephantiasis.\\n\\n#Treatment.#--The first indication is to endeavour to arrest the spread\\nof the process. We have found that by painting with linimentum iodi, a\\nring half an inch broad, about an inch in front of the peripheral tender\\nzone--not the red margin--an artificial leucocytosis is produced, and\\nthe advancing streptococci are thereby arrested. Several coats of the\\niodine are applied, one after the other, and this is repeated daily for\\nseveral days, even although the erysipelas has not overstepped the ring.\\nSuccess depends upon using the liniment of iodine (the tincture is not\\nstrong enough), and in applying it well in front of the disease. To\\nallay pain the most useful local applications are ichthyol ointment (1\\nin 6), or lead and opium fomentations.\\n\\nThe general treatment consists in attending to the emunctories, in\\nadministrating quinine in small--two-grain--doses every four hours, or\\nsalicylate of iron (2-5 gr. every three hours), and in giving plenty of\\nfluid nourishment. It is worthy of note that the anti-streptococcic\\nserum has proved of less value in the treatment of erysipelas than might\\nhave been expected, probably because the serum is not made from the\\nproper strain of streptococcus.\\n\\nIt is not necessary to isolate cases of erysipelas, provided the usual\\nprecautions against carrying infection from one patient to another are\\nrigidly carried out.\\n\\n\\nDIPHTHERIA\\n\\nDiphtheria is an acute infective disease due to the action of a specific\\nbacterium, the _bacillus diphtheriae_ or _Klebs-Loffler bacillus_. The\\ndisease is usually transmitted from one patient to another, but it may\\nbe contracted from cats, fowls, or through the milk of infected cows.\\nCases have occurred in which the surgeon has carried the infection from\\none patient to another through neglect of antiseptic precautions. The\\nincubation period varies from two to seven days.\\n\\n#Clinical Features.#--In _pharyngeal diphtheria_, on the first or\\nsecond day of the disease, redness and swelling of the mucous membrane\\nof the pharynx, tonsils, and palate are well marked, and small, circular\\ngreenish or grey patches of false membrane, composed of necrosed\\nepithelium, fibrin, leucocytes, and red blood corpuscles, begin to\\nappear. These rapidly increase in area and thickness, till they coalesce\\nand form a complete covering to the parts. In the pharynx the false\\nmembrane is less adherent to the surface than it is when the disease\\naffects the air-passages. The diphtheritic process may spread from the\\npharynx to the nasal cavities, causing blocking of the nares, with a\\nprofuse ichorous discharge from the nostrils, and sometimes severe\\nepistaxis. The infection may spread along the nasal duct to the\\nconjunctiva. The middle ear also may become involved by spread along the\\nauditory (Eustachian) tube.\\n\\nThe lymph glands behind the angle of the jaw enlarge and become tender,\\nand may suppurate from superadded infection. There is pain on\\nswallowing, and often earache; and the patient speaks with a nasal\\naccent. He becomes weak and anaemic, and loses his appetite. There is\\noften albuminuria. Leucocytosis is usually well marked before the\\ninjection of antitoxin; after the injection there is usually a\\ndiminution in the number of leucocytes. The false membrane may separate\\nand be cast off, after which the patient gradually recovers. Death may\\ntake place from gradual failure of the heart\\'s action or from syncope\\nduring some slight exertion.\\n\\n_Laryngeal Diphtheria._--The disease may arise in the larynx, although,\\nas a rule, it spreads thence from the pharynx. It first manifests itself\\nby a short, dry, croupy cough, and hoarseness of the voice. The first\\ndifficulty in breathing usually takes place during the night, and once\\nit begins, it rapidly gets worse. Inspiration becomes noisy, sometimes\\nstridulous or metallic or sibilant, and there is marked indrawing of the\\nepigastrium and lower intercostal spaces. The hoarseness becomes more\\nmarked, the cough more severe, and the patient restless. The difficulty\\nof breathing occurs in paroxysms, which gradually increase in frequency\\nand severity, until at length the patient becomes asphyxiated. The\\nduration of the disease varies from a few hours to four or five days.\\n\\nAfter the acute symptoms have passed off, various localised\\nparalyses may develop, affecting particularly the nerves of the palatal\\nand orbital muscles, less frequently the lower limbs.\\n\\n#Diagnosis.#--The finding of the Klebs-Loffler bacillus is the only\\nconclusive evidence of the disease. The bacillus may be obtained by\\nswabbing the throat with a piece of aseptic--not antiseptic--cotton wool\\nor clean linen rag held in a pair of forceps, and rotated so as to\\nentangle portions of the false membrane or exudate. The swab thus\\nobtained is placed in a test-tube, previously sterilised by having had\\nsome water boiled in it, and sent to a laboratory for investigation. To\\nidentify the bacillus a piece of the membrane from the swab is rubbed on\\na cover glass, dried, and stained with methylene blue or other basic\\nstain; or cultures may be made on agar or other suitable medium. When a\\nbacteriological examination is impossible, or when the clinical features\\ndo not coincide with the results obtained, the patient should always be\\ntreated on the assumption that he suffers from diphtheria. So much doubt\\nexists as to the real nature of membranous croup and its relationship to\\ntrue diphtheria, that when the diagnosis between the two is uncertain\\nthe safest plan is to treat the case as one of diphtheria.\\n\\nIn children, diphtheria may occur on the vulva, vagina, prepuce, or\\nglans penis, and give rise to difficulty in diagnosis, which is only\\ncleared up by demonstration of the bacillus.\\n\\n#Treatment.#--An attempt may be made to destroy or to counteract the\\norganisms by swabbing the throat with strong antiseptic solutions, such\\nas 1 in 1000 corrosive sublimate or 1 in 30 carbolic acid, or by\\nspraying with peroxide of hydrogen.\\n\\nThe antitoxic serum is our sheet-anchor in the treatment of diphtheria,\\nand recourse should be had to its use as early as possible.\\n\\nDifficulty of swallowing may be met by the use of a stomach tube passed\\neither through the mouth or nose. When this is impracticable, nutrient\\nenemata are called for.\\n\\nIn laryngeal diphtheria, the interference with respiration may call for\\nintubation of the larynx, or tracheotomy, but the antitoxin treatment\\nhas greatly diminished the number of cases in which it becomes necessary\\nto have recourse to these measures.\\n\\nIntubation consists in introducing through the mouth into the larynx a\\ntube which allows the patient to breathe freely during the period while\\nthe membrane is becoming separated and thrown off. This is best done\\nwith the apparatus of O\\'Dwyer; but when this instrument is not\\navailable, a simple gum-elastic catheter with a terminal opening (as\\nsuggested by Macewen and Annandale) may be employed.\\n\\nWhen intubation is impracticable, the operation of tracheotomy is\\ncalled for if the patient\\'s life is endangered by embarrassment of\\nrespiration. Unless the patient is in hospital with skilled assistance\\navailable, tracheotomy is the safer of the two procedures.\\n\\n\\nTETANUS\\n\\nTetanus is a disease resulting from infection of a wound by a specific\\nmicro-organism, the _bacillus tetani_, and characterised by increased\\nreflex excitability, hypertonus, and spasm of one or more groups of\\nvoluntary muscles.\\n\\n_Etiology and Morbid Anatomy._--The tetanus bacillus, which is a perfect\\nanaerobe, is widely distributed in nature and can be isolated from\\ngarden earth, dung-heaps, and stable refuse. It is a slender rod-shaped\\nbacillus, with a single large spore at one end giving it the shape of a\\ndrum-stick (Fig. 26). The spores, which are the active agents in\\nproducing tetanus, are highly resistant to chemical agents, retain their\\nvitality in a dry condition, and even survive boiling for five minutes.\\n\\nThe organism does not readily establish itself in the human body, and\\nseems to flourish best when it finds a nidus in necrotic tissue and is\\naccompanied by aerobic organisms, which, by using up the oxygen in the\\ntissues, provide for it a suitable environment. The presence of a\\nforeign body in the wound seems to favour its action. The infection is\\nfor all practical purposes a local one, the symptoms of the disease\\nbeing due to the toxins produced in the wound of infection acting upon\\nthe central nervous system.\\n\\nThe toxin acts principally on the nerve centres in the spinal medulla,\\nto which it travels from the focus of infection by way of the nerve\\nfibres supplying the voluntary muscles. Its first effect on the motor\\nganglia of the cord is to render them hypersensitive, so that they are\\nexcited by mild stimuli, which under ordinary conditions would produce\\nno reaction. As the toxin accumulates the reflex arc is affected, with\\nthe result that when a stimulus reaches the ganglia a motor discharge\\ntakes place, which spreads by ascending and descending collaterals to\\nthe reflex apparatus of the whole cord. As the toxin spreads it causes\\nboth motor hyper-tonus and hyper-excitability, which accounts for the\\ntonic contraction and the clonic spasms characteristic of tetanus.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Bacillus of Tetanus from scraping of a wound of\\nfinger, x 1000 diam. Basic fuchsin stain.]\\n\\n#Clinical Varieties of Tetanus.#--_Acute_ or _Fulminating\\nTetanus_.--This variety is characterised by the shortness of the\\nincubation period, the rapidity of its progress, the severity of its\\nsymptoms, and its all but universally fatal issue in spite of\\ntreatment, death taking place in from one to four days. The\\ncharacteristic symptoms may appear within three or four days of the\\ninfliction of the wound, but the incubation period may extend to three\\nweeks, and the wound may be quite healed before the disease declares\\nitself--_delayed tetanus_. Usually, however, the wound is inflamed and\\nsuppurating, with ragged and sloughy edges. A slight feverish attack may\\nmark the onset of the tetanic condition, or the patient may feel\\nperfectly well until the spasms begin. If careful observations be made,\\nit may be found that the muscles in the immediate neighbourhood of the\\nwound are the first to become contracted; but in the majority of\\ninstances the patient\\'s first complaint is of pain and stiffness in the\\nmuscles of mastication, notably the masseter, so that he has difficulty\\nin opening the mouth--hence the popular name \"lock-jaw.\" The muscles of\\nexpression soon share in the rigidity, and the face assumes a taut,\\nmask-like aspect. The angles of the mouth may be retracted, producing a\\ngrinning expression known as the _risus sardonicus_.\\n\\nThe next muscles to become stiff and painful are those of the neck,\\nespecially the sterno-mastoid and trapezius. The patient is inclined to\\nattribute the pain and stiffness to exposure to cold or rheumatism. At\\nan early stage the diaphragm and the muscles of the anterior abdominal\\nwall become contracted; later the muscles of the back and thorax are\\ninvolved; and lastly those of the limbs. Although this is the typical\\norder of involvement of the different groups of muscles, it is not\\nalways adhered to.\\n\\nTo this permanent tonic contraction of the muscles there are soon added\\nclonic spasms. These spasms are at first slight and transient, with\\nprolonged intervals between the attacks, but rapidly tend to become more\\nfrequent, more severe, and of longer duration, until eventually the\\npatient simply passes out of one seizure into another.\\n\\nThe distribution of the spasms varies in different cases: in some it is\\nconfined to particular groups of muscles, such as those of the neck,\\nback, abdominal walls, or limbs; in others all these groups are\\nsimultaneously involved.\\n\\nWhen the muscles of the back become spasmodically contracted, the body\\nis raised from the bed, sometimes to such an extent that the patient\\nrests only on his heels and occiput--the position of _opisthotonos_.\\nLateral arching of the body from excessive action of the muscles on one\\nside--_pleurosthotonos_--is not uncommon, the arching usually taking\\nplace towards the side on which the wound of infection exists. Less\\nfrequently the body is bent forward so that the knees and chin almost\\nmeet (_emprosthotonos_). Sometimes all the muscles simultaneously become\\nrigid, so that the body assumes a statuesque attitude (_orthotonos_).\\nWhen the thoracic muscles, including the diaphragm, are thrown into\\nspasm, the patient experiences a distressing sensation as if he were\\ngripped in a vice, and has extreme difficulty in getting breath. Between\\nthe attacks the limbs are kept rigidly extended. The clonic spasms may\\nbe so severe as to rupture muscles or even to fracture one of the long\\nbones.\\n\\nAs time goes on, the clonic exacerbations become more and more frequent,\\nand the slightest external stimulus, such as the feeling of the pulse, a\\nwhisper in the room, a noise in the street, a draught of cold air, the\\neffort to swallow, a question addressed to the patient or his attempt to\\nanswer, is sufficient to determine an attack. The movements are so\\nforcible and so continuous that the nurse has great difficulty in\\nkeeping the bedclothes on the patient, or even in keeping him in bed.\\n\\nThe general condition of the patient is pitiful in the extreme. He is\\nfully conscious of the gravity of the disease, and his mind remains\\nclear to the end. The suffering induced by the cramp-like spasms of the\\nmuscles keeps him in a constant state of fearful apprehension of the\\nnext seizure, and he is unable to sleep until he becomes utterly\\nexhausted.\\n\\nThe temperature is moderately raised (100 o to 102 o F.), or may remain\\nnormal throughout. Shortly before death very high temperatures (110 o F.)\\nhave been recorded, and it has been observed that the thermometer\\nsometimes continues to rise after death, and may reach as high as\\n112 o F. or more.\\n\\nThe pulse corresponds with the febrile condition. It is accelerated\\nduring the spasms, and may become exceedingly rapid and feeble before\\ndeath, probably from paralysis of the vagus. Sudden death from cardiac\\nparalysis or from cardiac spasm is not uncommon.\\n\\nThe respiration is affected in so far as the spasms of the respiratory\\nmuscles produce dyspnoea, and a feeling of impending suffocation which\\nadds to the horrors of the disease.\\n\\nOne of the most constant symptoms is a copious perspiration, the patient\\nbeing literally bathed in sweat. The urine is diminished in quantity,\\nbut as a rule is normal in composition; as in other acute infective\\nconditions, albumen and blood may be present. Retention of urine may\\nresult from spasm of the urethral muscles, and necessitate the use of\\nthe catheter.\\n\\nThe fits may cease some time before death, or, on the other hand, death\\nmay occur during a paroxysm from fixation of the diaphragm and arrest of\\nrespiration.\\n\\n_Differential Diagnosis._--There is little difficulty, as a rule, in\\ndiagnosing a case of fulminating tetanus, but there are several\\nconditions with which it may occasionally be confused. In _strychnin\\npoisoning_, for example, the spasms come on immediately after the\\npatient has taken a toxic dose of the drug; they are clonic in\\ncharacter, but the muscles are relaxed between the fits. If the dose is\\nnot lethal, the spasms soon cease. In _hydrophobia_ a history of having\\nbeen bitten by a rabid animal is usually forthcoming; the spasms, which\\nare clonic in character, affect chiefly the muscles of respiration and\\ndeglutition, and pass off entirely in the intervals between attacks.\\nCertain cases of _haemorrhage into the lateral ventricles_ of the brain\\nalso simulate tetanus, but an analysis of the symptoms will prevent\\nerrors in diagnosis. _Cerebro-spinal meningitis_ and _basal meningitis_\\npresent certain superficial resemblances to tetanus, but there is no\\ntrismus, and the spasms chiefly affect the muscles of the neck and\\nback. _Hysteria and catalepsy_ may assume characters resembling those\\nof tetanus, but there is little difficulty in distinguishing between\\nthese diseases. Lastly, in the _tetany_ of children, or that following\\noperations on the thyreoid gland, the spasms are of a jerking character,\\naffect chiefly the hands and fingers, and yield to medicinal treatment.\\n\\n#Chronic Tetanus.#--The difference between this and acute tetanus is\\nmainly one of degree. Its incubation period is longer, it is more slow\\nand insidious in its progress, and it never reaches the same degree of\\nseverity. Trismus is the most marked and constant form of spasm; and\\nwhile the trunk muscles may be involved, those of respiration as a rule\\nescape. Every additional day the patient lives adds to the probability\\nof his ultimate recovery. When the disease does prove fatal, it is from\\nexhaustion, and not from respiratory or cardiac spasm. The usual\\nduration is from six to ten weeks.\\n\\n#Delayed Tetanus.#--During the European War acute tetanus occasionally\\ndeveloped many weeks or even months after a patient had been injured,\\nand when the original wound had completely healed. It usually followed\\nsome secondary operation, _e.g._, for the removal of a foreign body, or\\nthe breaking down of adhesions, which aroused latent organisms.\\n\\n#Local Tetanus.#--This term is applied to a form of the disease in which\\nthe hypertonus and spasms are localised to the muscles in the vicinity\\nof the wound. It usually occurs in patients who have had prophylactic\\ninjections of anti-tetanic serum, the toxins entering the blood being\\nprobably neutralised by the antibodies in circulation, while those\\npassing along the motor nerves are unaffected.\\n\\nWhen it occurs in the _limbs_, attention is usually directed to the fact\\nby pain accompanying the spasms; the muscles are found to be hard and\\nthere are frequent twitchings of the limb. A characteristic reflex is\\npresent in the lower extremity, namely, extension of the foot and leg\\nwhen the sole is tickled.\\n\\n_Cephalic Tetanus_ is another localised variety which follows injury in\\nthe distribution of the facial nerve. It is characterised by the\\noccurrence on the same side as the injury, of facial spasm, rapidly\\nfollowed by more or less complete paralysis of the muscles of\\nexpression, with unilateral trismus and difficulty in swallowing. Other\\ncranial nerves, particularly the oculomotor and the hypoglossal, may\\nalso be implicated. A remarkable feature of this condition is that\\nalthough the muscles are irresponsive to ordinary physiological stimuli,\\nthey are thrown into spasm by the abnormal impulses of tetanus.\\n\\n_Trismus._--This term is used to denote a form of tetanic spasm limited\\nto the muscles of mastication. It is really a mild form of chronic\\ntetanus, and the prognosis is favourable. It must not be confused with\\nthe fixation of the jaw sometimes associated with a wisdom-tooth\\ngumboil, with tonsillitis, or with affections of the temporo-mandibular\\narticulation.\\n\\n_Tetanus neonatorum_ is a form of tetanus occurring in infants of about\\na week old. Infection takes place through the umbilicus, and manifests\\nitself clinically by spasms of the muscles of mastication. It is almost\\ninvariably fatal within a few days.\\n\\n_Prophylaxis._--Experience in the European War has established the\\nfact that the routine injection of anti-tetanic serum to all patients\\nwith lacerated and contaminated wounds greatly reduces the frequency of\\ntetanus. The sooner the serum is given after the injury, the more\\ncertain is its effect; within twenty-four hours 1500 units injected\\nsubcutaneously is sufficient for the initial dose; if a longer period\\nhas elapsed, 2000 to 3000 units should be given intra-muscularly, as\\nthis ensures more rapid absorption. A second injection is given a week\\nafter the first.\\n\\nThe wound must be purified in the usual way, and all instruments and\\nappliances used for operations on tetanic patients must be immediately\\nsterilised by prolonged boiling.\\n\\n_Treatment._--When tetanus has developed the main indications are to\\nprevent the further production of toxins in the wound, and to neutralise\\nthose that have been absorbed into the nervous system. Thorough\\npurification with antiseptics, excision of devitalised tissues, and\\ndrainage of the wound are first carried out. To arrest the absorption of\\ntoxins intra-muscular injections of 10,000 units of serum are given\\ndaily into the muscles of the affected limb, or directly into the nerve\\ntrunks leading from the focus of infection, in the hope of \"blocking\"\\nthe nerves with antitoxin and so preventing the passage of toxins\\ntowards the spinal cord.\\n\\nTo neutralise the toxins that have already reached the spinal cord, 5000\\nunits should be injected intra-thecally daily for four or five days, the\\nfoot of the bed being raised to enable the serum to reach the upper\\nparts of the cord.\\n\\nThe quantity of toxin circulating in the blood is so small as to be\\npractically negligible, and the risk of anaphylactic shock attending\\nintra-venous injection outweighs any benefit likely to follow this\\nprocedure.\\n\\nBaccelli recommends the injection of 20 c.c. of a 1 in 100 solution of\\ncarbolic acid into the subcutaneous tissues every four hours during the\\nperiod that the contractions persist. Opinions vary as to the\\nefficiency of this treatment. The intra-thecal injection of 10 c.c. of a\\n15 per cent. solution of magnesium sulphate has proved beneficial in\\nalleviating the severity of the spasms, but does not appear to have a\\ncurative effect.\\n\\nTo conserve the patient\\'s strength by preventing or diminishing the\\nseverity of the spasms, he should be placed in a quiet room, and every\\nform of disturbance avoided. Sedatives, such as bromides, paraldehyde,\\nor opium, must be given in large doses. Chloral is perhaps the best, and\\nthe patient should rarely have less than 150 grains in twenty-four\\nhours. When he is unable to swallow, it should be given by the rectum.\\nThe administration of chloroform is of value in conserving the strength\\nof the patient, by abolishing the spasms, and enabling the attendants to\\nadminister nourishment or drugs either through a stomach tube or by the\\nrectum. Extreme elevation of temperature is met by tepid sponging. It is\\nnecessary to use the catheter if retention of urine occurs.\\n\\n\\nHYDROPHOBIA\\n\\nHydrophobia is an acute infective disease following on the bite of a\\nrabid animal. It most commonly follows the bite or lick of a rabid dog\\nor cat. The virus appears to be communicated through the saliva of the\\nanimal, and to show a marked affinity for nerve tissues; and the disease\\nis most likely to develop when the patient is infected on the face or\\nother uncovered part, or in a part richly endowed with nerves.\\n\\nA dog which has bitten a person should on no account be killed until its\\ncondition has been proved one way or the other. Should rabies develop\\nand its destruction become necessary, the head and spinal cord should be\\nretained and forwarded, packed in ice, to a competent observer. Much\\nanxiety to the person bitten and to his friends would be avoided if\\nthese rules were observed, because in many cases it will be shown that\\nthe animal did not after all suffer from rabies, and that the patient\\nconsequently runs no risk. If, on the other hand, rabies is proved to be\\npresent, the patient should be submitted to the Pasteur treatment.\\n\\n_Clinical Features._--There is almost always a history of the patient\\nhaving been bitten or licked by an animal supposed to suffer from\\nrabies. The incubation period averages about forty days, but varies from\\na fortnight to seven or eight months, and is shorter in young than in\\nold persons. The original wound has long since healed, and beyond a\\nslight itchiness or pain shooting along the nerves of the part, shows no\\nsign of disturbance. A few days of general malaise, with chills and\\ngiddiness precede the onset of the acute manifestations, which affect\\nchiefly the muscles of deglutition and respiration. One of the earliest\\nsigns is that the patient has periodically a sudden catch in his\\nbreathing \"resembling what often occurs when a person goes into a cold\\nbath.\" This is due to spasm of the diaphragm, and is frequently\\naccompanied by a loud-sounding hiccough, likened by the laity to the\\nbarking of a dog. Difficulty in swallowing fluids may be the first\\nsymptom.\\n\\nThe spasms rapidly spread to all the muscles of deglutition and\\nrespiration, so that the patient not only has the greatest difficulty in\\nswallowing, but has a constant sense of impending suffocation. To add to\\nhis distress, a copious secretion of viscid saliva fills his mouth. Any\\nvoluntary effort, as well as all forms of external stimuli, only serve\\nto aggravate the spasms which are always induced by the attempt to\\nswallow fluid, or even by the sound of running water.\\n\\nThe temperature is raised; the pulse is small, rapid, and intermittent;\\nand the urine may contain sugar and albumen.\\n\\nThe mind may remain clear to the end, or the patient may have delusions,\\nsupposing himself to be surrounded by terrifying forms. There is always\\nextreme mental agitation and despair, and the sufferer is in constant\\nfear of his impending fate. Happily the inevitable issue is not long\\ndelayed, death usually occurring in from two to four days from the\\nonset. The symptoms of the disease are so characteristic that there is\\nno difficulty in diagnosis. The only condition with which it is liable\\nto be confused is the variety of cephalic tetanus in which the muscles\\nof deglutition are specially involved--the so-called tetanus\\nhydrophobicus.\\n\\n_Prophylaxis._--The bite of an animal suspected of being rabid should be\\ncauterised at once by means of the actual or Paquelin cautery, or by a\\nstrong chemical escharotic such as pure carbolic acid, after which\\nantiseptic dressings are applied.\\n\\nIt is, however, to Pasteur\\'s _preventive inoculation_ that we must look\\nfor our best hope of averting the onset of symptoms. \"It may now be\\ntaken as established that a grave responsibility rests on those\\nconcerned if a person bitten by a mad animal is not subjected to the\\nPasteur treatment\" (Muir and Ritchie).\\n\\nThis method is based on the fact that the long incubation period of the\\ndisease admits of the patient being inoculated with a modified virus\\nproducing a mild attack, which protects him from the natural disease.\\n\\n_Treatment._--When the symptoms have once developed they can only be\\npalliated. The patient must be kept absolutely quiet and free from all\\nsources of irritation. The spasms may be diminished by means of chloral\\nand bromides, or by chloroform inhalation.\\n\\n\\nANTHRAX\\n\\nAnthrax is a comparatively rare disease, communicable to man from\\ncertain of the lower animals, such as sheep, oxen, horses, deer, and\\nother herbivora. In animals it is characterised by symptoms of acute\\ngeneral poisoning, and, from the fact that it produces a marked\\nenlargement of the spleen, is known in veterinary surgery as \"splenic\\nfever.\"\\n\\nThe _bacillus anthracis_ (Fig. 27), the largest of the known pathogenic\\nbacteria, occurs in groups or in chains made up of numerous bacilli,\\neach bacillus measuring from 6 to 8 u in length. The organisms are found\\nin enormous numbers throughout the bodies of animals that have died of\\nanthrax, and are readily recognised and cultivated. Sporulation only\\ntakes place outside the body, probably because free oxygen is necessary\\nto the process. In the spore-free condition, the organisms are readily\\ndestroyed by ordinary germicides, and by the gastric juice. The spores,\\non the other hand, have a high degree of resistance. Not only do they\\nremain viable in the dry state for long periods, even up to a year, but\\nthey survive boiling for five minutes, and must be subjected to dry heat\\nat 140 o C. for several hours before they are destroyed.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Bacillus of Anthrax in section of skin, from a\\ncase of malignant pustule; shows vesicle containing bacilli. x 400 diam.\\nGram\\'s stain.]\\n\\n_Clinical Varieties of Anthrax._--In man, anthrax may manifest itself in\\none of three clinical forms.\\n\\nIt may be transmitted by means of spores or bacilli directly from a\\ndiseased animal to those who, by their occupation or otherwise, are\\nbrought into contact with it--for example, shepherds, butchers,\\nveterinary surgeons, or hide-porters. Infection may occur on the face by\\nthe use of a shaving-brush contaminated by spores. The path of infection\\nis usually through an abrasion of the skin, and the primary\\nmanifestations are local, constituting what is known as _the malignant\\npustule_.\\n\\nIn other cases the disease is contracted through the inhalation of the\\ndried spores into the respiratory passages. This occurs oftenest in\\nthose who work amongst wool, fur, and rags, and a form of acute\\npneumonia of great virulence ensues. This affection is known as\\n_wool-sorter\\'s disease_, and is almost universally fatal.\\n\\nThere is reason to believe that infection may also take place by means\\nof spores ingested into the alimentary canal in meat or milk derived\\nfrom diseased animals, or in infected water.\\n\\n#Clinical Features of Malignant Pustule.#--We shall here confine\\nourselves to the consideration of the local lesion as it occurs in the\\nskin--_the malignant pustule_.\\n\\nThe point of infection is usually on an uncovered part of the body, such\\nas the face, hands, arms, or back of the neck, and the wound may be\\nexceedingly minute. After an incubation period varying from a few hours\\nto several days, a reddish nodule resembling a small boil appears at the\\nseat of inoculation, the immediately surrounding skin becomes swollen\\nand indurated, and over the indurated area there appear a number of\\nsmall vesicles containing serum, which at first is clear but soon\\nbecomes blood-stained (Fig. 28). Coincidently the subcutaneous tissue\\nfor a considerable distance around becomes markedly oedematous, and the\\nskin red and tense. Within a few hours, blood is extravasated in the\\ncentre of the indurated area, the blisters burst, and a dark brown or\\nblack eschar, composed of necrosed skin and subcutaneous tissue and\\naltered blood, forms (Fig. 29). Meanwhile the induration extends, fresh\\nvesicles form and in turn burst, and the eschar increases in size. The\\nneighbouring lymph glands soon become swollen and tender. The affected\\npart is hot and itchy, but the patient does not complain of great pain.\\nThere is a moderate degree of constitutional disturbance, with headache,\\nnausea, and sometimes shivering.\\n\\nIf the infection becomes generalised--_anthracaemia_--the temperature\\nrises to 103 o or 104 o F., the pulse becomes feeble and rapid, and other\\nsigns of severe blood-poisoning appear: vomiting, diarrhoea, pains in the\\nlimbs, headache and delirium, and the condition proves fatal in from\\nfive to eight days.\\n\\n_Differential Diagnosis._--When the malignant pustule is fully\\ndeveloped, the central slough with the surrounding vesicles and the\\nwidespread oedema are characteristic. The bacillus can be obtained from\\nthe peripheral portion of the slough, from the blisters, and from the\\nadjacent lymph vessels and glands. The occupation of the patient may\\nsuggest the possibility of anthrax infection.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Malignant Pustule, third day after infection\\nwith Anthrax, showing great oedema of upper extremity and pectoral region\\n(cf. Fig. 29).]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Malignant Pustule, fourteen days after\\ninfection, showing black eschar in process of separation. The oedema has\\nlargely disappeared. Treated by Sclavo\\'s serum (cf. Fig. 28).]\\n\\n_Prophylaxis._--Any wound suspected of being infected with anthrax\\nshould at once be cauterised with caustic potash, the actual cautery, or\\npure carbolic acid.\\n\\n_Treatment._--The best results hitherto obtained have followed the use\\nof the anti-anthrax serum introduced by Sclavo. The initial dose is 40\\nc.c., and if the serum is given early in the disease, the beneficial\\neffects are manifest in a few hours. Favourable results have also\\nfollowed the use of pyocyanase, a vaccine prepared from the bacillus\\npyocyaneus.\\n\\nBy some it is recommended that the local lesion should be freely\\nexcised; others advocate cauterisation of the affected part with solid\\ncaustic potash till all the indurated area is softened. Graf has had\\nexcellent results by the latter method in a large series of cases, the\\noedema subsiding in about twenty-four hours and the constitutional\\nsymptoms rapidly improving. Wolff and Wiewiorowski, on the other hand,\\nhave had equally good results by simply protecting the local lesion with\\na mild antiseptic dressing, and relying upon general treatment.\\n\\nThe general treatment consists in feeding and stimulating the patient as\\nfreely as possible. Quinine, in 5 to 10 grain doses every four hours,\\nand powdered ipecacuanha, in 40 to 60 grain doses every four hours, have\\nalso been employed with apparent benefit.\\n\\n\\nGLANDERS\\n\\nGlanders is due to the action of a specific bacterium, the _bacillus\\nmallei_, which resembles the tubercle bacillus, save that it is somewhat\\nshorter and broader, and does not stain by Gram\\'s method. It requires\\nhigher temperatures for its cultivation than the tubercle bacillus, and\\nits growth on potato is of a characteristic chocolate-brown colour, with\\na greenish-yellow ring at the margin of the growth. The bacillus mallei\\nretains its vitality for long periods under ordinary conditions, but is\\nreadily killed by heat and chemical agents. It does not form spores.\\n\\n_Clinical Features._--Both in the lower animals and in man the bacillus\\ngives rise to two distinct types of disease--_acute glanders_, and\\n_chronic glanders_ or _farcy_.\\n\\nAcute Glanders is most commonly met with in the horse and in other\\nequine animals, horned cattle being immune. It affects the septum of the\\nnose and adjacent parts, firm, translucent, greyish nodules containing\\nlymphoid and epithelioid cells appearing in the mucous membrane. These\\nnodules subsequently break down in the centre, forming irregular\\nulcers, which are attended with profuse discharge, and marked\\ninflammatory swelling. The cervical lymph glands, as well as the lungs,\\nspleen, and liver, may be the seat of secondary nodules.\\n\\n_In man_, acute glanders is commoner than the chronic variety. Infection\\nalways takes place through an abraded surface, and usually on one of the\\nuncovered parts of the body--most commonly the skin of the hands, arms,\\nor face; or on the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, or eye. The\\ndisease has been acquired by accidental inoculation in the course of\\nexperimental investigations in the laboratory, and proved fatal. The\\nincubation period is from three to five days.\\n\\nThe _local_ manifestations are pain and swelling in the region of the\\ninfected wound, with inflammatory redness around it and along the lines\\nof the superficial lymphatics. In the course of a week, small, firm\\nnodules appear, and are rapidly transformed into pustules. These may\\noccur on the face and in the vicinity of joints, and may be mistaken for\\nthe eruption of small-pox.\\n\\nAfter breaking down, these pustules give rise to irregular ulcers, which\\nby their confluence lead to extensive destruction of skin. Sometimes the\\nnasal mucous membrane becomes affected, and produces a discharge--at\\nfirst watery, but later sanious and purulent. Necrosis of the bones of\\nthe nose may take place, in which case the discharge becomes peculiarly\\noffensive. In nearly every case metastatic abscesses form in different\\nparts of the body, such as the lungs, joints, or muscles.\\n\\nDuring the development of the disease the patient feels ill, complains\\nof headache and pains in the limbs, the temperature rises to 104 o or\\neven to 106 o F., and assumes a pyaemic type. The pulse becomes rapid and\\nweak. The tongue is dry and brown. There is profuse sweating,\\nalbuminuria, and often insomnia with delirium. Death may take place\\nwithin a week, but more frequently occurs during the second or third\\nweek.\\n\\n_Differential Diagnosis._--There is nothing characteristic in the site\\nof the primary lesion in man, and the condition may, during the early\\nstages, be mistaken for a boil or carbuncle, or for any acute\\ninflammatory condition. Later, the disease may simulate acute articular\\nrheumatism, or may manifest all the symptoms of acute septicaemia or\\npyaemia. The diagnosis is established by the recognition of the bacillus.\\nVeterinary surgeons attach great importance to the mallein test as a\\nmeans of diagnosis in animals, but in the human subject its use is\\nattended with considerable risk and is not to be recommended.\\n\\n_Treatment._--Excision of the primary nodule, followed by the\\napplication of the thermo-cautery and sponging with pure carbolic acid,\\nshould be carried out, provided the condition is sufficiently limited to\\nrender complete removal practicable.\\n\\nWhen secondary abscesses form in accessible situations, they must be\\nincised, disinfected, and drained. The general treatment is carried out\\non the same lines as in other acute infective diseases.\\n\\n#Chronic Glanders.#--_In the horse_ the chronic form of glanders is\\nknown as _farcy_, and follows infection through an abrasion of the skin,\\ninvolving chiefly the superficial lymph vessels and glands. The\\nlymphatics become indurated and nodular, constituting what veterinarians\\ncall _farcy pipes_ and _farcy buds_.\\n\\n_In man_ also the clinical features of the chronic variety of the\\ndisease are somewhat different from those of the acute form. Here, too,\\ninfection takes place through a broken cutaneous surface, and leads to a\\nsuperficial lymphangitis with nodular thickening of the lymphatics\\n(_farcy buds_). The neighbouring glands soon become swollen and\\nindurated. The primary lesion meanwhile inflames, suppurates, and, after\\nbreaking down, leaves a large, irregular ulcer with thickened edges and\\na foul, purulent or bloody discharge. The glands break down in the same\\nway, and lead to wide destruction of skin, and the resulting sinuses and\\nulcers are exceedingly intractable. Secondary deposits in the\\nsubcutaneous tissue, the muscles, and other parts, are not uncommon, and\\nthe nasal mucous membrane may become involved. The disease often runs a\\nchronic course, extending to four or five months, or even longer.\\nRecovery takes place in about 50 per cent. of cases, but the\\nconvalescence is prolonged, and at any time the disease may assume the\\ncharacters of the acute variety and speedily prove fatal.\\n\\nThe _differential diagnosis_ is often difficult, especially in the\\nchronic nodules, in which it may be impossible to demonstrate the\\nbacillus. The ulcerated lesions of farcy have to be distinguished from\\nthose of tubercle, syphilis, and other forms of infective granuloma.\\n\\n_Treatment._--Limited areas of disease should be completely excised. The\\ngeneral condition of the patient must be improved by tonics, good food,\\nand favourable hygienic surroundings. In some cases potassium iodide\\nacts beneficially.\\n\\n\\nACTINOMYCOSIS\\n\\nActinomycosis is a chronic disease due to the action of an organism\\nsomewhat higher in the vegetable scale than ordinary bacteria--the\\n_streptothrix actinomyces_ or _ray fungus_.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Section of Actinomycosis Colony in Pus from\\nAbscess of Liver, showing filaments and clubs of streptothrix\\nactinomyces. x 400 diam. Gram\\'s stain.]\\n\\n_Etiology and Morbid Anatomy._--The actinomyces, which has never been\\nmet with outside the body, gives rise in oxen, horses, and other animals\\nto tumour-like masses composed of granulation tissue; and in man to\\nchronic suppurative processes which may result in a condition resembling\\nchronic pyaemia. The actinomyces is more complex in structure than other\\npathogenic organisms, and occurs in the tissues in the form of small,\\nround, semi-translucent bodies, about the size of a pin-head or less,\\nand consisting of colonies of the fungus. On account of their yellow\\ntint they are spoken of as \"sulphur grains.\" Each colony is made up of a\\nseries of thin, interlacing, and branching _filaments_, some of which\\nare broken up so as to form masses or chains of _cocci_; and around the\\nperiphery of the colony are elongated, pear-shaped, hyaline, _club-like\\nbodies_ (Fig. 30).\\n\\nInfection is believed to be conveyed by the husks of cereals, especially\\nbarley; and the organism has been found adhering to particles of grain\\nembedded in the tissues of animals suffering from the disease. In the\\nhuman subject there is often a history of exposure to infection from\\nsuch sources, and the disease is said to be most common during the\\nharvesting months.\\n\\nAround each colony of actinomyces is a zone of granulation tissue in\\nwhich suppuration usually occurs, so that the fungus comes to lie in a\\nbath of greenish-yellow pus. As the process spreads these purulent foci\\nbecome confluent and form abscess cavities. When metastasis takes place,\\nas it occasionally does, the fungus is transmitted by the blood vessels,\\nas in pyaemia.\\n\\n_Clinical features._--In man the disease may be met with in the skin,\\nthe organisms gaining access through an abrasion, and spreading by the\\nformation of new nodules in the same way as tuberculosis.\\n\\nThe region of the mouth and jaws is one of the commonest sites of\\nsurgical actinomycosis. Infection takes place, as a rule, along the side\\nof a carious tooth, and spreads to the lower jaw. A swelling is slowly\\nand insidiously developed, but when the loose connective tissue of the\\nneck becomes infiltrated, the spread is more rapid. The whole region\\nbecomes infiltrated and swollen, and the skin ultimately gives way and\\nfree suppuration occurs, resulting in the formation of sinuses. The\\ncharacteristic greenish-grey or yellow granules are seen in the pus, and\\nwhen examined microscopically reveal the colonies of actinomyces.\\n\\nLess frequently the maxilla becomes affected, and the disease may spread\\nto the base of the skull and brain. The vertebrae may become involved by\\ninfection taking place through the pharynx or oesophagus, and leading to\\na condition simulating tuberculous disease of the spine. When it\\nimplicates the intestinal canal and its accessory glands, the lungs,\\npleura, and bronchial tubes, or the brain, the disease is not amenable\\nto surgical treatment.\\n\\n_Differential Diagnosis._--The conditions likely to be mistaken for\\nsurgical actinomycosis are sarcoma, tubercle, and syphilis. In the early\\nstages the differential diagnosis is exceedingly difficult. In many\\ncases it is only possible when suppuration has occurred and the fungus\\ncan be demonstrated.\\n\\nThe slow destruction of the affected tissue by suppuration, the absence\\nof pain, tenderness, and redness, simulate tuberculosis, but the absence\\nof glandular involvement helps to distinguish it.\\n\\nSyphilitic lesions are liable to be mistaken for actinomycosis, all the\\nmore that in both diseases improvement follows the administration of\\niodides. When it affects the lower jaw, in its early stages,\\nactinomycosis may closely simulate a periosteal sarcoma.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Actinomycosis of Maxilla. The disease spread to\\nopposite side; finally implicated base of skull, and proved fatal.\\nTreated by radium.\\n\\n(Mr. D. P. D. Wilkie\\'s case.)]\\n\\nThe recognition of the fungus is the crucial point in diagnosis.\\n\\n_Prognosis._--Spontaneous cure rarely occurs. When the disease\\nimplicates internal organs, it is almost always fatal. On external parts\\nthe destructive process gradually spreads, and the patient eventually\\nsuccumbs to superadded septic infection. When, from its situation, the\\nprimary focus admits of removal, the prognosis is more favourable.\\n\\n_Treatment._--The surgical treatment is early and free removal of the\\naffected tissues, after which the wound is cauterised by the actual\\ncautery, and sponged over with pure carbolic acid. The cavity is packed\\nwith iodoform gauze, no attempt being made to close the wound.\\n\\nSuccess has attended the use of a vaccine prepared from cultures of the\\norganism; and the X-rays and radium, combined with the administration of\\niodides in large doses, or with intra-muscular injections of a 10 per\\ncent. solution of cacodylate of soda, have proved of benefit.\\n\\nMYCETOMA, OR MADURA FOOT.--Mycetoma is a chronic disease due to\\nan organism resembling that of actinomycosis, but not identical with it.\\nIt is endemic in certain tropical countries, and is most frequently met\\nwith in India. Infection takes place through an abrasion of the skin,\\nand the disease usually occurs on the feet of adult males who work\\nbarefooted in the fields.\\n\\n_Clinical Features._--The disease begins on the foot as an indurated\\npatch, which becomes discoloured and permeated by black or yellow\\nnodules containing the organism. These nodules break down by\\nsuppuration, and numerous minute abscesses lined by granulation tissues\\nare thus formed. In the pus are found yellow particles likened to\\nfish-roe, or black pigmented granules like gunpowder. Sinuses form, and\\nthe whole foot becomes greatly swollen and distorted by flattening of\\nthe sole and dorsiflexion of the toes. Areas of caries or necrosis occur\\nin the bones, and the disease gradually extends up the leg (Fig. 32).\\nThere is but little pain, and no glandular involvement or constitutional\\ndisturbance. The disease runs a prolonged course, sometimes lasting for\\ntwenty or thirty years. Spontaneous cure never takes place, and the risk\\nto life is that of prolonged suppuration.\\n\\nIf the disease is localised, it may be removed by the knife or sharp\\nspoon, and the part afterwards cauterised. As a rule, amputation well\\nabove the disease is the best line of treatment. Unlike actinomycosis,\\nthis disease does not appear to be benefited by iodides.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Mycetoma, or Madura Foot. (Museum of Royal\\nCollege of Surgeons, Edinburgh.)]\\n\\nDELHI BOIL.--_Synonyms_--Aleppo boil, Biskra button, Furunculus\\norientalis, Natal sore.\\n\\nDelhi boil is a chronic inflammatory disease, most commonly met with in\\nIndia, especially towards the end of the wet season. The disease occurs\\noftenest on the face, and is believed to be due to an organism, although\\nthis has not been demonstrated. The infection is supposed to be conveyed\\nthrough water used for washing, or by the bites of insects.\\n\\n_Clinical Features._--A red spot, resembling the mark of a mosquito\\nbite, appears on the affected part, and is attended with itching. After\\nbecoming papular and increasing to the size of a pea, desquamation takes\\nplace, leaving a dull-red surface, over which in the course of several\\nweeks there develops a series of small yellowish-white spots, from which\\nserum exudes, and, drying, forms a thick scab. Under this scab the skin\\nulcerates, leaving small oval sores with sharply bevelled edges, and an\\nuneven floor covered with yellow or sanious pus. These sores vary in\\nnumber from one to forty or fifty. They may last for months and then\\nheal spontaneously, or may continue to spread until arrested by suitable\\ntreatment. There is no enlargement of adjacent glands, and but little\\ninflammatory reaction in the surrounding tissues; nor is there any\\nmarked constitutional disturbance. Recovery is often followed by\\ncicatricial contraction leading to deformity of the face.\\n\\nThe _treatment_ consists in destroying the original papule by the actual\\ncautery, acid nitrate of mercury, or pure carbolic acid. The ulcers\\nshould be scraped with the sharp spoon, and cauterised.\\n\\nCHIGOE.--Chigoe or jigger results from the introduction of the\\neggs of the sand-flea (_Pulex penetrans_) into the tissues. It occurs in\\ntropical Africa, South America, and the West Indies. The impregnated\\nfemale flea remains attached to the part till the eggs mature, when by\\ntheir irritation they cause localised inflammation with pustules or\\nvesicles on the surface. Children are most commonly attacked,\\nparticularly about the toe-nails and on the scrotum. The treatment\\nconsists in picking out the insect with a blunt needle, special care\\nbeing taken not to break it up. The puncture is then cauterised. The\\napplication of essential oils to the feet acts as a preventive.\\n\\nPOISONING BY INSECTS.--The bites of certain insects, such as\\nmosquitoes, midges, different varieties of flies, wasps, and spiders,\\nmay be followed by serious complications. The effects are mainly due to\\nthe injection of an irritant acid secretion, the exact nature of which\\nhas not been ascertained.\\n\\nThe local lesion is a puncture, surrounded by a zone of hyperaemia,\\nwheals, or vesicles, and is associated with burning sensations and\\nitching which usually pass off in a few hours, but may recur at\\nintervals, especially when the patient is warm in bed. Scratching also\\nreproduces the local signs and symptoms. Where the connective tissue is\\nloose--for example, in the eyelid or scrotum--there is often\\nconsiderable swelling; and in the mouth and fauces this may lead to\\noedema of the glottis, which may prove fatal.\\n\\nThe _treatment_ consists in the local application of dilute alkalies\\nsuch as ammonia water, solutions of carbonate or bicarbonate of soda, or\\nsal-volatile. Weak carbolic lotions, or lead and opium lotion, are\\nuseful in allaying the local irritation. One of the best means of\\nneutralising the poison is to apply to the sting a drop of a mixture\\ncontaining equal parts of pure carbolic acid and liquor ammoniae.\\n\\nFree stimulation is called for when severe constitutional symptoms are\\npresent.\\n\\nSNAKE-BITES.--We are here only concerned with the injuries\\ninflicted by the venomous varieties of snakes, the most important of\\nwhich are the hooded snakes of India, the rattle-snakes of America, the\\nhorned snakes of Africa, the viper of Europe, and the adder of the\\nUnited Kingdom.\\n\\nWhile the virulence of these creatures varies widely, they are all\\ncapable of producing in a greater or less degree symptoms of acute\\npoisoning in man and other animals. By means of two recurved fangs\\nattached to the upper jaw, and connected by a duct with poison-secreting\\nglands, they introduce into their prey a thick, transparent, yellowish\\nfluid, of acid reaction, probably of the nature of an albumose, and\\nknown as the _venom_.\\n\\nThe _clinical features_ resulting from the injection of the venom vary\\ndirectly in intensity with the amount of the poison introduced, and the\\nrapidity with which it reaches the circulating blood, being most marked\\nwhen it immediately enters a large vein. The poison is innocuous when\\ntaken into the stomach.\\n\\n_Locally_ the snake inflicts a double wound, passing vertically into the\\nsubcutaneous tissue; the edges of the punctures are ecchymosed, and the\\nadjacent vessels the seat of thrombosis. Immediately there is intense\\npain, and considerable swelling with congestion, which tends to spread\\ntowards the trunk. Extensive gangrene may ensue. There is no special\\ninvolvement of the lymphatics.\\n\\nThe _general symptoms_ may come on at once if the snake is a\\nparticularly venomous one, or not for some hours if less virulent. In\\nthe majority of viper or adder bites the constitutional disturbance is\\nslight and transient, if it appears at all. Snake-bites in children are\\nparticularly dangerous.\\n\\nThe patient\\'s condition is one of profound shock with faintness,\\ngiddiness, dimness of sight, and a feeling of great terror. The pupils\\ndilate, the skin becomes moist with a clammy sweat, and nausea with\\nvomiting, sometimes of blood, ensues. High fever, cramps, loss of\\nsensation, haematuria, and melaena are among the other symptoms that may\\nbe present. The pulse becomes feeble and rapid, the respiratory nerve\\ncentres are profoundly depressed, and delirium followed by coma usually\\nprecedes the fatal issue, which may take place in from five to\\nforty-eight hours. If the patient survives for two days the prognosis is\\nfavourable.\\n\\n_Treatment._--A broad ligature should be tied tightly round the limb\\nabove the seat of infection, to prevent the poison passing into the\\ngeneral circulation, and bleeding from the wound should be encouraged.\\nThe application of an elastic bandage from above downward to empty the\\nblood out of the infected portion of the limb has been recommended. The\\nwhole of the bite should at once be excised, and crystals of\\npermanganate of potash rubbed into the wound until it is black, or\\nperoxide of hydrogen applied with the object of destroying the poison by\\noxidation.\\n\\nThe general treatment consists in free stimulation with whisky, brandy,\\nammonia, digitalis, etc. Hypodermic injections of strychnin in doses\\nsufficiently large to produce a slight degree of poisoning by the drug\\nare particularly useful. The most rational treatment, when it is\\navailable, is the use of the _antivenin_ introduced by Fraser and\\nCalmette.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nTUBERCULOSIS\\n\\n\\nTubercle bacillus--Methods of infection--Inherited and acquired\\n    predisposition--Relationship of tuberculosis to injury--Human and\\n    bovine tuberculosis--Action of the bacillus upon the\\n    tissues--Tuberculous granulation tissue--Natural cure--Recrudescence\\n    of the disease--THE TUBERCULOUS ABSCESS--Contents and wall of the\\n    abscess--Tuberculous sinuses.\\n\\nTuberculosis occurs more frequently in some situations than in others;\\nit is common, for example, in lymph glands, in bones and joints, in the\\nperitoneum, the intestine, the kidney, prostate and testis, and in the\\nskin and subcutaneous cellular tissue; it is seldom met with in the\\nbreast or in muscles, and it rarely affects the ovary, the pancreas, the\\nparotid, or the thyreoid.\\n\\n_Tubercle bacilli_ vary widely in their virulence, and they are more\\ntenacious of life than the common pyogenic bacteria. In a dry state, for\\nexample, they can retain their vitality for months; and they can also\\nsurvive immersion in water for prolonged periods. They resist the action\\nof the products of putrefaction for a considerable time, and are not\\ndestroyed by digestive processes in the stomach and intestine. They may\\nbe killed in a few minutes by boiling, or by exposure to steam under\\npressure, or by immersion for less than a minute in 1 in 20 carbolic\\nlotion.\\n\\n#Methods of Infection.#--In marked contrast to what obtains in the\\ninfective diseases that have already been described, tuberculosis rarely\\nresults from the _infection of a wound_. In exceptional instances,\\nhowever, this does occur, and in illustration of the fact may be cited\\nthe case of a servant who cut her finger with a broken spittoon\\ncontaining the sputum of her consumptive master; the wound subsequently\\nshowed evidence of tuberculous infection, which ultimately spread up\\nalong the lymph vessels of the arm. Pathologists, too, whose hands,\\nbefore the days of rubber gloves, were frequently exposed to the contact\\nof tuberculous tissues and pus, were liable to suffer from a form of\\ntuberculosis of the skin of the finger, known as _anatomical tubercle_.\\nSlight wounds of the feet in children who go about barefoot in towns\\nsometimes become infected with tubercle. Operation wounds made with\\ninstruments contaminated with tuberculous material have also been known\\nto become infected. It is highly probable that the common form of\\ntuberculosis of the skin known as \"lupus\" arises by direct infection\\nfrom without.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Tubercle Bacilli in caseous material\\nx 1000 diam. Z. Neilsen stain.]\\n\\nIn the vast majority of cases the tubercle bacillus gains entrance to\\nthe body by way of the mucous surfaces, the organisms being either\\ninhaled or swallowed; those inhaled are mostly derived from the human\\nsubject, those swallowed, from cattle. Bacilli, whether inhaled or\\nswallowed, are especially apt to lodge about the pharynx and pass to the\\npharyngeal lymphoid tissue and tonsils, and by way of the lymph vessels\\nto the glands. The glands most frequently infected in this way are the\\ncervical glands, and those within the cavity of the chest--particularly\\nthe bronchial glands at the root of the lung. From these, infection\\nextends at any later period in life to the bones, joints, and internal\\norgans.\\n\\nThere is reason to believe that the organisms may lie in a dormant\\ncondition for an indefinite period in these glands, and only become\\nactive long afterwards, when some depression of the patient\\'s health\\nproduces conditions which favour their growth. When the organisms become\\nactive in this way, the tuberculous tissue undergoes softening and\\ndisintegration, and the infective material, by bursting into an adjacent\\nvein, may enter the blood-stream, in which it is carried to distant\\nparts of the body. In this way a _general tuberculosis_ may be set up,\\nor localised foci of tuberculosis may develop in the tissues in which\\nthe organisms lodge. Many tuberculous patients are to be regarded as\\npossessing in their bronchial glands, or elsewhere, an internal store of\\nbacilli, to which the disease for which advice is sought owes its\\norigin, and from which similar outbreaks of tuberculosis may originate\\nin the future.\\n\\n_The alimentary mucous membrane_, especially that of the lower ileum and\\ncaecum, is exposed to infection by swallowed sputum and by food\\nmaterials, such as milk, containing tubercle bacilli. The organisms may\\nlodge in the mucous membrane and cause tuberculous ulceration, or they\\nmay be carried through the wall of the bowel into the lacteals, along\\nwhich they pass to the mesenteric glands where they become arrested and\\ngive rise to tuberculous disease.\\n\\n#Relationship of Tuberculosis to Trauma.#--Any tissue whose vitality has\\nbeen lowered by injury or disease furnishes a favourable nidus for the\\nlodgment and growth of tubercle bacilli. The injury or disease, however,\\nis to be looked upon as determining the _localisation_ of the\\ntuberculous lesion rather than as an essential factor in its causation.\\nIn a person, for example, in whose blood tubercle bacilli are\\ncirculating and reaching every tissue and organ of the body, the\\noccurrence of tuberculous disease in a particular part may be determined\\nby the depression of the tissues resulting from an injury of that part.\\nThere can be no doubt that excessive movement and jarring of a limb\\naggravates tuberculous disease of a joint; also that an injury may light\\nup a focus that has been long quiescent, but we do not agree with\\nthose--Da Costa, for example--who maintain that injury may be a\\ndetermining cause of tuberculosis. The question is not one of mere\\nacademic interest, but one that may raise important issues in the law\\ncourts.\\n\\n#Human and Bovine Tuberculosis.#--The frequency of the bovine bacillus\\nin the abdominal and in the glandular and osseous tuberculous lesions of\\nchildren would appear to justify the conclusion that the disease is\\ntransmissible from the ox to the human subject, and that the milk of\\ntuberculous cows is probably a common vehicle of transmission.\\n\\n#Changes in the Tissues following upon the successful Lodgment of\\nTubercle Bacilli.#--The action of the bacilli on the tissues results in\\nthe formation of granulation tissue comprising characteristic tissue\\nelements and with a marked tendency to undergo caseation.\\n\\nThe recognition of the characteristic elements, with or without\\ncaseation, is usually sufficient evidence of the tuberculous nature of\\nany portion of tissue examined for diagnostic purposes. The recognition\\nof the bacillus itself by appropriate methods of staining makes the\\ndiagnosis a certainty; but as it is by no means easy to identify the\\norganism in many forms of surgical tuberculosis, it may be necessary to\\nhave recourse to experimental inoculation of susceptible animals such as\\nguinea-pigs.\\n\\nThe changes subsequent to the formation of tuberculous granulation\\ntissue are liable to many variations. It must always be borne in mind\\nthat although the bacilli have effected a lodgment and have inaugurated\\ndisease, the relation between them and the tissues remains one of mutual\\nantagonism; which of them is to gain and keep the upper hand in the\\nconflict depends on their relative powers of resistance.\\n\\nIf the tissues prevail, there ensues a process of repair. In the\\nimmediate vicinity of the area of infection young connective tissue, and\\nlater, fibrous tissue, is formed. This may replace the tuberculous\\ntissue and bring about repair--a fibrous cicatrix remaining to mark the\\nscene of the previous contest. Scars of this nature are frequently\\ndiscovered at the apex of the lung after death in persons who have at\\none time suffered from pulmonary phthisis. Under other circumstances,\\nthe tuberculous tissue that has undergone caseation, or even\\ncalcification, is only encapsulated by the new fibrous tissue, like a\\nforeign body. Although this may be regarded as a victory for the\\ntissues, the cure, if such it may be called, is not necessarily a\\npermanent one, for at any subsequent period, if the part affected is\\ndisturbed by injury or through some other influence, the encapsulated\\ntubercle may again become active and get the upper hand of the tissues,\\nand there results a relapse or recrudescence of the disease. This\\n_tendency to relapse_ after apparent cure is a notable feature of\\ntuberculous disease as it is met with in the spine, or in the\\nhip-joint, and it necessitates a prolonged course of treatment to give\\nthe best chance of a lasting cure.\\n\\nIf, however, at the inauguration of the tuberculous disease the bacilli\\nprevail, the infection tends to spread into the tissues surrounding\\nthose originally infected, and more and more tuberculous granulation\\ntissue is formed. Finally the tuberculous tissue breaks down and\\nliquefies, resulting in the formation of a cold abscess. In their\\nstruggle with the tissues, tubercle bacilli receive considerable support\\nand assistance from any pyogenic organisms that may be present. A\\ntuberculous infection may exhibit its aggressive qualities in a more\\nserious manner by sending off detachments of bacilli, which are carried\\nby the lymphatics to the nearest glands, or by the blood-stream to more\\ndistant, and it may be to all, parts of the body. When the infection is\\nthus generalised, the condition is called _general tuberculosis_.\\nConsidering the extraordinary frequency of localised forms of surgical\\ntuberculosis, general dissemination of the disease is rare.\\n\\n#The clinical features# of surgical tuberculosis will be described with\\nthe individual tissues and organs, as they vary widely according to the\\nsituation of the lesion.\\n\\n#The general treatment# consists in combating the adverse influences\\nthat have been mentioned as increasing the liability to tuberculous\\ninfection. Within recent years the value of the \"open-air\" treatment has\\nbeen widely recognised. An open-air life, even in the centre of a city,\\nmay be followed by marked improvement, especially in the hospital class\\nof patient, whose home surroundings tend to favour the progress of the\\ndisease. The purer air of places away from centres of population is\\nstill better; and, according to the idiosyncrasies of the individual\\npatient, mountain air or that of the sea coast may be preferred. In view\\nof the possible discomforts and gastric disturbance which may attend a\\nsea-voyage, this should be recommended to patients suffering from\\ntuberculous lesions with more caution than has hitherto been exercised.\\nThe diet must be a liberal one, and should include those articles which\\nare at the same time easily digested and nourishing, especially proteids\\nand fats; milk obtained from a reliable source and underdone\\nbutcher-meat are among the best. When the ordinary nourishment taken is\\ninsufficient, it may be supplemented by such articles as malt extract,\\nstout, and cod-liver oil. The last is specially beneficial in patients\\nwho do not take enough fat in other forms. It is noteworthy that many\\ntuberculous patients show an aversion to fat.\\n\\nFor _the use of tuberculin in diagnosis_ and for _the vaccine treatment\\nof tuberculosis_ the reader is referred to text-books on medicine.\\n\\nIn addition to increasing the resisting power of the patient, it is\\nimportant to enable the fluids of the body, so altered, to come into\\ncontact with the tuberculous focus. One of the obstacles to this is that\\nthe focus is often surrounded by tissues or fluids which have been\\nalmost entirely deprived of bactericidal substances. In the case of\\ncaseated glands in the neck, for example, it is obvious that the removal\\nof this inert material is necessary before the tissues can be irrigated\\nwith fluids of high bactericidal value. Again, in tuberculous ascites\\nthe abdominal cavity is filled with a fluid practically devoid of\\nanti-bacterial substances, so that the bacilli are able to thrive and\\nwork their will on the tissues. When the stagnant fluid is got rid of by\\nlaparotomy, the parts are immediately douched with lymph charged with\\nprotective substances, the bactericidal power of which may be many times\\nthat of the fluid displaced.\\n\\nIt is probable that the beneficial influence of _counter-irritants_,\\nsuch as blisters, and exposure to the _Finsen light_ and other forms of\\n_rays_, is to be attributed in part to the increased flow of blood to\\nthe infected tissues.\\n\\n_Artificial Hyperaemia._--As has been explained, the induction of\\nhyperaemia by the method devised by Bier, constitutes one of our most\\nefficient means of combating bacterial infection. The treatment of\\ntuberculosis on this plan has been proved by experience to be a valuable\\naddition to our therapeutic measures, and the simplicity of its\\napplication has led to its being widely adopted in practice. It results\\nin an increase in the reactive changes around the tuberculous focus, an\\nincrease in the immigration of leucocytes, and infiltration with the\\nlymphocytes.\\n\\nThe constricting bandage should be applied at some distance above the\\nseat of infection; for instance, in disease of the wrist, it is put on\\nabove the elbow, and it must not cause pain either where it is applied\\nor in the diseased part. The bandage is only applied for a few hours\\neach day, either two hours at a time or twice a day for one hour, and,\\nwhile it is on, all dressings are removed save a piece of sterile gauze\\nover any wound or sinus that may be present. The process of cure takes a\\nlong time--nine or even twelve months in the case of a severe joint\\naffection.\\n\\nIn cases in which a constricting bandage is inapplicable, for example,\\nin cold abscesses, tuberculous glands or tendon sheaths, Klapp\\'s suction\\nbell is employed. The cup is applied for five minutes at a time and then\\ntaken off for three minutes, and this is repeated over a period of\\nabout three-quarters of an hour. The pus is allowed to escape by a small\\nincision, and no packing or drain should be introduced.\\n\\nIt has been found that tuberculous lesions tend to undergo cure\\nwhen the infected tissues are exposed to the rays of the\\nsun--_heliotherapy_--therefore whenever practicable this therapeutic\\nmeasure should be had recourse to.\\n\\nSince the introduction of the methods of treatment described above, and\\nespecially by their employment at an early stage in the disease, the\\nnumber of cases of tuberculosis requiring operative interference has\\ngreatly diminished. There are still circumstances, however, in which an\\noperation is required; for example, in disease of the lymph glands for\\nthe removal of inert masses of caseous material, in disease of bone for\\nthe removal of sequestra, or in disease of joints to improve the\\nfunction of the limb. It is to be understood, however, that operative\\ntreatment must always be preceded by and combined with other therapeutic\\nmeasures.\\n\\n\\nTUBERCULOUS ABSCESS\\n\\nThe caseation of tuberculous granulation tissue and its liquefaction is\\na slow and insidious process, and is unattended with the classical signs\\nof inflammation--hence the terms \"cold\" and \"chronic\" applied to the\\ntuberculous abscess.\\n\\nIn a cold abscess, such as that which results from tuberculous disease\\nof the vertebrae, the clinical appearances are those of a soft, fluid\\nswelling without heat, redness, pain, or fever. When toxic symptoms are\\npresent, they are usually due to a mixed infection.\\n\\nA tuberculous abscess results from the disintegration and liquefaction\\nof tuberculous granulation tissue which has undergone caseation. Fluid\\nand cells from the adjacent blood vessels exude into the cavity, and\\nlead to variations in the character of its contents. In some cases the\\ncontents consist of a clear amber-coloured fluid, in which are suspended\\nfragments of caseated tissue; in others, of a white material like\\ncream-cheese. From the addition of a sufficient number of leucocytes,\\nthe contents may resemble the pus of an ordinary abscess.\\n\\nThe wall of the abscess is lined with tuberculous granulation tissue,\\nthe inner layers of which are undergoing caseation and disintegration,\\nand present a shreddy appearance; the outer layers consist of\\ntuberculous tissue which has not yet undergone caseation. The abscess\\ntends to increase in size by progressive liquefaction of the inner\\nlayers, caseation of the outer layers, and the further invasion of the\\nsurrounding tissues by tubercle bacilli. In this way a tuberculous\\nabscess is capable of indefinite extension and increase in size until it\\nreaches a free surface and ruptures externally. The direction in which\\nit spreads is influenced by the anatomical arrangement of the tissues,\\nand possibly to some extent by gravity, and the abscess may reach the\\nsurface at a considerable distance from its seat of origin. The best\\nillustration of this is seen in the psoas abscess, which may originate\\nin the dorsal vertebrae, extend downwards within the sheath of the psoas\\nmuscle, and finally appear in the thigh.\\n\\n#Clinical Features.#--The insidious development of the tuberculous\\nabscess is one of its characteristic features. The swelling may attain a\\nconsiderable size without the patient being aware of its existence, and,\\nas a matter of fact, it is often discovered accidentally. The absence of\\ntoxaemia is to be associated with the incapacity of the wall of the\\nabscess to permit of absorption; this is shown also by the fact that\\nwhen even a large quantity of iodoform is inserted into the cavity of\\nthe abscess, there are no symptoms of poisoning. The abscess varies in\\nsize from a small cherry to a cavity containing several pints of pus.\\nIts shape also varies; it is usually that of a flattened sphere, but it\\nmay present pockets or burrows running in various directions. Sometimes\\nit is hour-glass or dumb-bell shaped, as is well illustrated in the\\nregion of the groin in disease of the spine or pelvis, where there may\\nbe a large sac occupying the venter ilii, and a smaller one in the\\nthigh, the two communicating by a narrow channel under Poupart\\'s\\nligament. By pressing with the fingers the pus may be displaced from one\\ncompartment to the other. The usual course of events is that the abscess\\nprogresses slowly, and finally reaches a free surface--generally the\\nskin. As it does so there may be some pain, redness, and local elevation\\nof temperature. Fluctuation becomes evident and superficial, and the\\nskin becomes livid and finally gives way. If the case is left to nature,\\nthe discharge of pus continues, and the track opening on the skin\\nremains as a _sinus_. The persistence of suppuration is due to the\\npresence in the wall of the abscess and of the sinus, of tuberculous\\ngranulation tissue, which, so long as it remains, continues to furnish\\ndischarge, and so prevents healing. Sooner or later pyogenic organisms\\ngain access to the sinus, and through it to the wall of the abscess.\\nThey tend further to depress the resisting power of the tissues, and\\nthereby aggravate and perpetuate the tuberculous disease. This\\nsuperadded infection with pyogenic organisms exposes the patient to the\\nfurther risks of septic intoxication, especially in the form of hectic\\nfever and septicaemia, and increases the liability to general\\ntuberculosis, and to waxy degeneration of the internal organs. The mixed\\ninfection is chiefly responsible for the pyrexia, sweating, and\\nemaciation which the laity associate with consumptive disease. A\\ntuberculous abscess may in one or other of these ways be a cause of\\ndeath.\\n\\n_Residual abscess_ is the name given to an abscess that makes its\\nappearance months, or even years, after the apparent cure of tuberculous\\ndisease--as, for example, in the hip-joint or spine. It is called\\nresidual because it has its origin in the remains of the original\\ndisease.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Tuberculous Abscess in right lumbar region in a\\nwoman aged thirty.]\\n\\n#Diagnosis.#--A cold abscess is to be diagnosed from a syphilitic gumma,\\na cyst, and from lipoma and other soft tumours. The differential\\ndiagnosis of these affections will be considered later; it is often made\\neasier by recognising the presence of a lesion that is likely to cause a\\ncold abscess, such as tuberculous disease of the spine or of the\\nsacro-iliac joint. When it is about to burst externally, it may be\\ndifficult to distinguish a tuberculous abscess from one due to infection\\nwith pyogenic organisms. Even when the abscess is opened, the\\nappearances of the pus may not supply the desired information, and it\\nmay be necessary to submit it to bacteriological examination. When the\\npus is found to be sterile, it is usually safe to assume that the\\ncondition is tuberculous, as in other forms of suppuration the causative\\norganisms can usually be recognised. Experimental inoculation will\\nestablish a definite diagnosis, but it implies a delay of two to three\\nweeks.\\n\\n#Treatment.#--The tuberculous abscess may recede and disappear under\\ngeneral treatment. Many surgeons advise that so long as the abscess is\\nquiescent it should be left alone. All agree, however, that if it shows\\na tendency to spread, to increase in size, or to approach the skin or a\\nmucous membrane, something should be done to avoid the danger of its\\nbursting and becoming infected with pyogenic organisms. Simple\\nevacuation of the abscess by a hollow needle may suffice, or bismuth or\\niodoform may be introduced after withdrawal of the contents.\\n\\n_Evacuation of the Abscess and Injection of Iodoform._--The iodoform is\\nemployed in the form of a 10 per cent. solution in ether or the same\\nproportion suspended in glycerin. Either form becomes sterile soon after\\nit is prepared. Its curative effects would appear to depend upon the\\nliberation of iodine, which restrains the activity of the bacilli, and\\nupon its capacity for irritating the tissues and so inducing a\\nprotective leucocytosis, and also of stimulating the formation of scar\\ntissue. An anaesthetic is rarely called for, except in children. The\\nabscess is first evacuated by means of a large trocar and cannula\\nintroduced obliquely through the overlying soft parts, avoiding any part\\nwhere the skin is thin or red. If the cannula becomes blocked with\\ncaseous material, it may be cleared with a probe, or a small quantity of\\nsaline solution is forced in by the syringe. The iodoform is injected by\\nmeans of a glass-barrelled syringe, which is firmly screwed on to the\\ncannula. The amount injected varies with the size of the abscess and the\\nage of the patient; it may be said to range from two or three drams in\\nthe case of children to several ounces in large abscesses in adults. The\\ncannula is withdrawn, the puncture is closed by a Michel\\'s clip, and a\\ndressing applied so as to exert a certain amount of compression. If the\\nabscess fills up again, the procedure should be repeated; in doing so,\\nthe contents show the coloration due to liberated iodine. When the\\ncontents are semi-solid, and cannot be withdrawn even through a large\\ncannula, an incision must be made, and, after the cavity has been\\nemptied, the iodoform is introduced through a short rubber tube attached\\nto the syringe. Experience has shown that even large abscesses, such as\\nthose associated with spinal disease, may be cured by iodoform\\ninjection, and this even when rupture of the abscess on the skin surface\\nhas appeared to be imminent.\\n\\nAnother method of treatment which is less popular now than it used to\\nbe, and which is chiefly applicable in abscesses of moderate size, is by\\n_incision of the abscess and removal of the tuberculous tissue in its\\nwall_ with the sharp spoon. An incision is made which will give free\\naccess to the interior of the abscess, so that outlying pockets or\\nrecesses may not be overlooked. After removal of the pus, the wall of\\nthe abscess is scraped with the Volkmann spoon or with Barker\\'s flushing\\nspoon, to get rid of the tuberculous tissue with which it is lined. In\\nusing the spoon, care must be taken that its sharp edge does not\\nperforate the wall of a vein or other important structure. Any debris\\nwhich may adhere to the walls is removed by rubbing with dry gauze. The\\noozing of blood is arrested by packing the cavity for a few minutes with\\ngauze. After the packing is removed, iodoform powder is rubbed into the\\nraw surface. The soft parts divided by the incision are sutured in\\nlayers so as to ensure primary union. If, on the other hand, there is\\nfear of a mixed infection, especially in abscesses near the rectum or\\nanus, it is safer to treat it by the open method, packing the cavity\\nwith iodoform worsted or bismuth gauze, which is renewed at intervals of\\na week or ten days as the cavity heals from the bottom.\\n\\nAnother method is to incise the abscess, cleanse the cavity with gauze,\\nirrigate with Carrel-Dakin solution and pack with gauze smeared with the\\ndilute non-toxic B.I.P.P. (bismuth and iodoform 2 parts, vaseline 12\\nparts, hard paraffin, sufficient to give the consistence of butter). The\\nwound is closed with \"bipped\" silk sutures; one of these--the \"waiting\\nsuture\"--is left loose to permit of withdrawal of the gauze after\\nforty-eight hours; the waiting suture is then tied, and delayed primary\\nunion is thus effected.\\n\\nWhen the skin over the abscess is red, thin, and about to give way, as\\nis frequently the case when the abscess is situated in the subcutaneous\\ncellular tissue, any skin which is undermined and infected with tubercle\\nshould be removed with the scissors at the same time that the abscess is\\ndealt with.\\n\\nIn abscesses treated by the open method, when the cavity has become\\nlined with healthy granulations, it may be closed by secondary suture,\\nor, if the granulating surface is flush with the skin, healing may be\\nhastened by skin-grafting.\\n\\nIf the tuberculous abscess has burst and left a _sinus_, this is apt to\\npersist because of the presence of tuberculous tissue in its wall, and\\nof superadded pyogenic infection, or because it serves as an avenue for\\nthe escape of discharge from a focus of tubercle in a bone or a lymph\\ngland.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Tuberculous Sinus injected through its opening\\nin the forearm with bismuth paste.\\n\\n(Mr. Pirie Watson\\'s case--Radiogram by Dr. Hope Fowler.)]\\n\\nThe treatment varies with the conditions present, and must include\\nmeasures directed to the lesion from which the sinus has originated. The\\nextent and direction of any given sinus may be demonstrated by the use\\nof the probe, or, more accurately, by injecting the sinus with a paste\\nconsisting of white vaseline containing 10 to 30 per cent. of bismuth\\nsubcarbonate, and following its track with the X-rays (Fig. 35).\\n\\nIt was found by Beck of Chicago that the injection of bismuth paste is\\nfrequently followed by healing of the sinus, and that, if one injection\\nfails to bring about a cure, repeating the injection every second day\\nmay be successful. Some caution must be observed in this treatment, as\\nsymptoms of poisoning have been observed to follow its use. If they\\nmanifest themselves, an injection of warm olive oil should be given; the\\noil, left in for twelve hours or so, forms an emulsion with the bismuth,\\nwhich can be withdrawn by aspiration. Iodoform suspended in glycerin may\\nbe employed in a similar manner. When these and other non-operative\\nmeasures fail, and the whole track of the sinus is accessible, it should\\nbe laid open, scraped, and packed with bismuth or iodoform gauze until\\nit heals from the bottom.\\n\\nThe _tuberculous ulcer_ is described in the chapter on ulcers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nSYPHILIS\\n\\n\\nDefinition.--Virus.--ACQUIRED SYPHILIS--Primary period:\\n    _Incubation, primary chancre, glandular enlargement_;\\n    _Extra-genital chancres_--Treatment--Secondary period: _General\\n    symptoms, skin affections, mucous patches, affections of bones,\\n    joints, eyes_, etc.--Treatment: _Salvarsan_--_Methods of\\n    administering mercury_--Syphilis and marriage--Intermediate\\n    stage--_Reminders_--Tertiary period: _General symptoms_,\\n    _gummata_, _tertiary ulcers_, _tertiary lesions of skin, mucous\\n    membrane, bones, joints_, etc.--Second attacks.--INHERITED\\n    SYPHILIS--Transmission--_Clinical features in infancy, in later\\n    life_--Contagiousness--Treatment.\\n\\nSyphilis is an infective disease due to the entrance into the body of a\\nspecific virus. It is nearly always communicated from one individual to\\nanother by contact infection, the discharge from a syphilitic lesion\\nbeing the medium through which the virus is transmitted, and the seat of\\ninoculation is almost invariably a surface covered by squamous\\nepithelium. The disease was unknown in Europe before the year 1493, when\\nit was introduced into Spain by Columbus\\' crew, who were infected in\\nHaiti, where the disease had been endemic from time immemorial (Bloch).\\n\\nThe granulation tissue which forms as a result of the reaction of the\\ntissues to the presence of the virus is chiefly composed of lymphocytes\\nand plasma cells, along with an abundant new formation of capillary\\nblood vessels. Giant cells are not uncommon, but the endothelioid cells,\\nwhich are so marked a feature of tuberculous granulation tissue, are\\npractically absent.\\n\\nWhen syphilis is communicated from one individual to another by contact\\ninfection, the condition is spoken of as _acquired syphilis_, and the\\nfirst visible sign of the disease appears at the site of inoculation,\\nand is known as _the primary lesion_. Those who have thus acquired the\\ndisease may transmit it to their offspring, who are then said to suffer\\nfrom _inherited syphilis_.\\n\\n#The Virus of Syphilis.#--The cause of syphilis, whether acquired or\\ninherited, is the organism, described by Schaudinn and Hoffman, in 1905,\\nunder the name of _spirochaeta pallida_ or _spironema pallidum_. It is a\\ndelicate, thread-like spirilla, in length averaging from 8 to 10 u and\\nin width about 0.25 u, and is distinguished from other spirochaetes by\\nits delicate shape, its dead-white appearance, together with its closely\\ntwisted spiral form, with numerous undulations (10 to 26), which are\\nperfectly regular, and are characteristic in that they remain the same\\nduring rest and in active movement (Fig. 36). In a fresh specimen, such\\nas a scraping from a hard chancre suspended in a little salt solution,\\nit shows active movements. The organism is readily destroyed by heat,\\nand perishes in the absence of moisture. It has been proved\\nexperimentally that it remains infective only up to six hours after its\\nremoval from the body. Noguchi has succeeded in obtaining pure cultures\\nfrom the infected tissues of the rabbit.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Spirochaeta pallida from scraping of hard\\nChancre of Prepuce. x 1000 diam. Burri method.]\\n\\nThe spirochaete may be recognised in films made by scraping the deeper\\nparts of the primary lesion, from papules on the skin, or from blisters\\nartificially raised on lesions of the skin or on the immediately\\nadjacent portion of healthy skin. It is readily found in the mucous\\npatches and condylomata of the secondary period. It is best stained by\\nGiemsa\\'s method, and its recognition is greatly aided by the use of the\\nultra-microscope.\\n\\nThe spirochaete has been demonstrated in every form of syphilitic lesion,\\nand has been isolated from the blood--with difficulty--and from lymph\\nwithdrawn by a hollow needle from enlarged lymph glands. The saliva of\\npersons suffering from syphilitic lesions of the mouth also contains the\\norganism.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Spirochaeta refrigerans from scraping of Vagina.\\nx 1000 diam. Burri method.]\\n\\nIn tertiary lesions there is greater difficulty in demonstrating the\\nspirochaete, but small numbers have been found in the peripheral parts of\\ngummata and in the thickened patches in syphilitic disease of the aorta.\\nNoguchi and Moore have discovered the spirochaete in the brain in a\\nnumber of cases of general paralysis of the insane. The spirochaete may\\npersist in the body for a long time after infection; its presence has\\nbeen demonstrated as long as sixteen years after the original\\nacquisition of the disease.\\n\\nIn inherited syphilis the spirochaete is present in enormous numbers\\nthroughout all the organs and fluids of the body.\\n\\nConsiderable interest attaches to the observations of Metchnikoff, Roux,\\nand Neisser, who have succeeded in conveying syphilis to the chimpanzee\\nand other members of the ape tribe, obtaining primary and secondary\\nlesions similar to those observed in man, and also containing the\\nspirochaete. In animals the disease has been transmitted by material from\\nall kinds of syphilitic lesions, including even the blood in the\\nsecondary and tertiary stages of the disease. The primary lesion is in\\nthe form of an indurated papule, in every respect resembling the\\ncorresponding lesion in man, and associated with enlargement and\\ninduration of the lymph glands. The primary lesion usually appears about\\nthirty days after inoculation, to be followed, in about half the cases,\\nby secondary manifestations, which are usually of a mild character; in\\nno instance has any tertiary lesion been observed. The severity of the\\naffection amongst apes would appear to be in proportion to the nearness\\nof the relationship of the animal to the human subject. The eye of the\\nrabbit is also susceptible to inoculation from syphilitic lesions; the\\nmaterial in a finely divided state is introduced into the anterior\\nchamber of the eye.\\n\\nAttempts to immunise against the disease have so far proved negative,\\nbut Metchnikoff has shown that the inunction of the part inoculated with\\nan ointment containing 33 per cent. of calomel, within one hour of\\ninfection, suffices to neutralise the virus in man, and up to eighteen\\nhours in monkeys. He recommends the adoption of this procedure in the\\nprophylaxis of syphilis.\\n\\nNoguchi has made an emulsion of dead spirochaetes which he calls\\n_luetin_, and which gives a specific reaction resembling that of\\ntuberculin in tuberculosis, a papule or a pustule forming at the site of\\nthe intra-dermal injection. It is said to be most efficacious in the\\ntertiary and latent forms of syphilis, which are precisely those forms\\nin which the diagnosis is surrounded with difficulties.\\n\\n\\nACQUIRED SYPHILIS\\n\\nIn the vast majority of cases, infection takes place during the congress\\nof the sexes. Delicate, easily abraded surfaces are then brought into\\ncontact, and the discharge from lesions containing the virus is placed\\nunder favourable conditions for conveying the disease from one person to\\nthe other. In the male the possibility of infection taking place is\\nincreased if the virus is retained under cover of a long and tight\\nprepuce, and if there are abrasions on the surface with which it comes\\nin contact. The frequency with which infection takes place on the\\ngenitals during sexual intercourse warrants syphilis being considered a\\nvenereal disease, although there are other ways in which it may be\\ncontracted.\\n\\nSome of these imply direct contact--such, for example, as kissing, the\\ndigital examination of syphilitic patients by doctors or nurses, or\\ninfection of the surgeon\\'s fingers while operating upon a syphilitic\\npatient. In suckling, a syphilitic wet nurse may infect a healthy\\ninfant, or a syphilitic infant may infect a healthy wet nurse. In other\\ncases the infection is by indirect contact, the virus being conveyed\\nthrough the medium of articles contaminated by a syphilitic\\npatient--such, for example, as surgical instruments, tobacco pipes, wind\\ninstruments, table utensils, towels, or underclothing. Physiological\\nsecretions, such as saliva, milk, or tears, are not capable of\\ncommunicating the disease unless contaminated by discharge from a\\nsyphilitic sore. While the saliva itself is innocuous, it can be, and\\noften is, contaminated by the discharge from mucous patches or other\\nsyphilitic lesions in the mouth and throat, and is then a dangerous\\nmedium of infection. Unless these extra-genital sources of infection are\\nborne in mind, there is a danger of failing to recognise the primary\\nlesion of syphilis in unusual positions, such as the lip, finger, or\\nnipple. When the disease is thus acquired by innocent transfer, it is\\nknown as _syphilis insontium_.\\n\\n#Stages or Periods of Syphilis.#--Following the teaching of Ricord, it\\nis customary to divide the life-history of syphilis into three periods\\nor stages, referred to, for convenience, as primary, secondary, and\\ntertiary. This division is to some extent arbitrary and artificial, as\\nthe different stages overlap one another, and the lesions of one stage\\nmerge insensibly into those of another. Wide variations are met with in\\nthe manifestations of the secondary stage, and histologically there is\\nno valid distinction to be drawn between secondary and tertiary lesions.\\n\\n_The primary period_ embraces the interval that elapses between the\\ninitial infection and the first constitutional manifestations,--roughly,\\nfrom four to eight weeks,--and includes the period of incubation, the\\ndevelopment of the primary sore, and the enlargement of the nearest\\nlymph glands.\\n\\n_The secondary period_ varies in duration from one to two years, during\\nwhich time the patient is liable to suffer from manifestations which are\\nfor the most part superficial in character, affecting the skin and its\\nappendages, the mucous membranes, and the lymph glands.\\n\\n_The tertiary period_ has no time-limit except that it follows upon the\\nsecondary, so that during the remainder of his life the patient is\\nliable to suffer from manifestations which may affect the deeper tissues\\nand internal organs as well as the skin and mucous membranes.\\n\\n#Primary Syphilis.#--_The period of incubation_ represents the interval\\nthat elapses between the occurrence of infection and the appearance of\\nthe primary lesion at the site of inoculation. Its limits may be stated\\nas varying from two to six weeks, with an average of from twenty-one to\\ntwenty-eight days. While the disease is incubating, there is nothing to\\nshow that infection has occurred.\\n\\n_The Primary Lesion._--The incubation period having elapsed, there\\nappears at the site of inoculation a circumscribed area of infiltration\\nwhich represents the reaction of the tissues to the entrance of the\\nvirus. The first appearance is that of a sharply defined papule, rarely\\nlarger than a split pea. Its surface is at first smooth and shiny, but\\nas necrosis of the tissue elements takes place in the centre, it becomes\\nconcave, and in many cases the epithelium is shed, and an ulcer is\\nformed. Such an ulcer has an elevated border, sharply cut edges, an\\nindurated base, and exudes a scanty serous discharge; its surface is at\\nfirst occupied by yellow necrosed tissue, but in time this is replaced\\nby smooth, pale-pink granulation tissue; finally, epithelium may spread\\nover the surface, and the ulcer heals. As a rule, the patient suffers\\nlittle discomfort, and may even be ignorant of the existence of the\\nlesion, unless, as a result of exposure to mechanical or septic\\nirritation, ulceration ensues, and the sore becomes painful and tender,\\nand yields a purulent discharge. The primary lesion may persist until\\nthe secondary manifestations make their appearance, that is, for several\\nweeks.\\n\\nIt cannot be emphasised too strongly that the induration of the primary\\nlesion, which has obtained for it the name of \"hard chancre,\" is its\\nmost important characteristic. It is best appreciated when the sore is\\ngrasped from side to side between the finger and thumb. The sensation on\\ngrasping it has been aptly compared to that imparted by a nodule of\\ncartilage, or by a button felt through a layer of cloth. The evidence\\nobtained by touch is more valuable than that obtained by inspection, a\\nfact which is made use of in the recognition of _concealed\\nchancres_--that is, those which are hidden by a tight prepuce. The\\ninduration is due not only to the dense packing of the connective-tissue\\nspaces with lymphocytes and plasma cells, but also to the formation of\\nnew connective-tissue elements. It is most marked in chancres situated\\nin the furrow between the glans and the prepuce.\\n\\n_In the male_, the primary lesion specially affects certain\\n_situations_, and the appearances vary with these: (1) On the inner\\naspect of the prepuce, and in the fold between the prepuce and the\\nglans; in the latter situation the induration imparts a \"collar-like\"\\nrigidity to the prepuce, which is most apparent when it is rolled back\\nover the corona. (2) At the orifice of the prepuce the primary lesion\\nassumes the form of multiple linear ulcers or fissures, and as each of\\nthese is attended with infiltration, the prepuce cannot be pulled\\nback--a condition known as _syphilitic phimosis_. (3) On the glans penis\\nthe infiltration may be so superficial that it resembles a layer of\\nparchment, but if it invades the cavernous tissue there is a dense mass\\nof induration. (4) On the external aspect of the prepuce or on the skin\\nof the penis itself. (5) At either end of the torn fraenum, in the form\\nof a diamond-shaped ulcer raised above the surroundings. (6) In relation\\nto the meatus and canal of the urethra, in either of which situations\\nthe swelling and induration may lead to narrowing of the urethra, so\\nthat the urine is passed with pain and difficulty and in a minute\\nstream; stricture results only in the exceptional cases in which the\\nchancre has ulcerated and caused destruction of tissue. A chancre within\\nthe orifice of the urethra is rare, and, being concealed from view, it\\ncan only be recognised by the discharge from the meatus and by the\\ninduration felt between the finger and thumb on palpating the urethra.\\n\\n_In the female_, the primary lesion is not so typical or so easily\\nrecognised as in men; it is usually met with on the labia; the\\ninduration is rarely characteristic and does not last so long. The\\nprimary lesion may take the form of condylomata. Indurated oedema, with\\nbrownish-red or livid discoloration of one or both labia, is diagnostic\\nof syphilis.\\n\\nThe hard chancre is usually solitary, but sometimes there are two or\\nmore; when there are several, they are individually smaller than the\\nsolitary chancre.\\n\\nIt is the exception for a hard chancre to leave a visible scar, hence,\\nin examining patients with a doubtful history of syphilis, little\\nreliance can be placed on the presence or absence of a scar on the\\ngenitals. When the primary lesion has taken the form of an open ulcer\\nwith purulent discharge, or has sloughed, there is a permanent scar.\\n\\n_Infection of the adjacent lymph glands_ is usually found to have taken\\nplace by the time the primary lesion has acquired its characteristic\\ninduration. Several of the glands along Poupart\\'s ligament, on one or on\\nboth sides, become enlarged, rounded, and indurated; they are usually\\nfreely movable, and are rarely sensitive unless there is superadded\\nseptic infection. The term _bullet-bubo_ has been applied to them, and\\ntheir presence is of great value in diagnosis. In a certain number of\\ncases, one of the main _lymph vessels_ on the dorsum of the penis is\\ntransformed into a fibrous cord easily recognisable on palpation, and\\nwhen grasped between the fingers appears to be in size and consistence\\nnot unlike the vas deferens.\\n\\n_Concealed chancre_ is the term applied when one or more chancres are\\nsituated within the sac of a prepuce which cannot be retracted. If the\\ninduration is well marked, the chancre can be palpated through the\\nprepuce, and is tender on pressure. As under these conditions it is\\nimpossible for the patient to keep the parts clean, septic infection\\nbecomes a prominent feature, the prepuce is oedematous and inflamed, and\\nthere is an abundant discharge of pus from its orifice. It occasionally\\nhappens that the infection assumes a virulent character and causes\\nsloughing of the prepuce--a condition known as _phagedaena_. The\\ndischarge is then foul and blood-stained, and the prepuce becomes of a\\ndusky red or purple colour, and may finally slough, exposing the glans.\\n\\n_Extra-genital or Erratic Chancres_ (Fig. 38).--Erratic chancre is the\\nterm applied by Jonathan Hutchinson to the primary lesion of syphilis\\nwhen it appears on parts of the body other than the genitals. It differs\\nin some respects from the hard chancre as met with on the penis; it is\\nusually larger, the induration is more diffused, and the enlarged glands\\nare softer and more sensitive. The glands in nearest relation to the\\nsore are those first affected, for example, the epitrochlear or axillary\\nglands in chancre of the finger; the submaxillary glands in chancre of\\nthe lip or mouth; or the pre-auricular gland in chancre of the eyelid or\\nforehead. In consequence of their divergence from the typical chancre,\\nand of their being often met with in persons who, from age,\\nsurroundings, or moral character, are unlikely subjects of venereal\\ndisease, the true nature of erratic chancres is often overlooked until\\nthe persistence of the lesion, its want of resemblance to anything else,\\nor the onset of constitutional symptoms, determines the diagnosis of\\nsyphilis. A solitary, indolent sore occurring on the lip, eyelid,\\nfinger, or nipple, which does not heal but tends to increase in size,\\nand is associated with induration and enlargement of the adjacent\\nglands, is most likely to be the primary lesion of syphilis.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Primary Lesion on Thumb, with Secondary\\nEruption on Forearm.[1]]\\n\\n[1] From _A System of Syphilis_, vol. ii., edited by D\\'Arcy Power and\\nJ. Keogh Murphy, Oxford Medical Publications.\\n\\n#The Soft Sore, Soft Chancre, or Chancroid.#--The differential diagnosis\\nof syphilis necessitates the consideration of the _soft sore_, _soft\\nchancre_, or _chancroid_, which is also a common form of venereal\\ndisease, and is due to infection with a virulent pus-forming bacillus,\\nfirst described by Ducrey in 1889. Ducrey\\'s bacillus occurs in the form\\nof minute oval rods measuring about 1.5 u in length, which stain readily\\nwith any basic aniline dye, but are quickly decolorised by Gram\\'s\\nmethod. They are found mixed with other organisms in the purulent\\ndischarge from the sore, and are chiefly arranged in small groups or in\\nshort chains. Soft sores are always contracted by direct contact from\\nanother individual, and the incubation period is a short one of from two\\nto five days. They are usually situated in the vicinity of the fraenum,\\nand, in women, about the labia minora or fourchette; they probably\\noriginate in abrasions in these situations. They appear as pustules,\\nwhich are rapidly converted into small, acutely inflamed ulcers with\\nsharply cut, irregular margins, which bleed easily and yield an abundant\\nyellow purulent discharge. They are devoid of the induration of\\nsyphilis, are painful, and nearly always multiple, reproducing\\nthemselves in successive crops by auto-inoculation. Soft sores are often\\ncomplicated by phimosis and balanitis, and they frequently lead to\\ninfection of the glands in the groin. The resulting bubo is ill-defined,\\npainful, and tender, and suppuration occurs in about one-fourth of the\\ncases. The overlying skin becomes adherent and red, and suppuration\\ntakes place either in the form of separate foci in the interior of the\\nindividual glands, or around them; in the latter case, on incision, the\\nglands are found lying bathed in pus. Ducrey\\'s bacillus is found in pure\\nculture in the pus. Sometimes other pyogenic organisms are superadded.\\nAfter the bubo has been opened the wound may take on the characters of a\\nsoft sore.\\n\\n_Treatment._--Soft sores heal rapidly when kept clean. If concealed\\nunder a tight prepuce, an incision should be made along the dorsum to\\ngive access to the sores. They should be washed with eusol, and dusted\\nwith a mixture of one part iodoform and two parts boracic or salicylic\\nacid, or, when the odour of iodoform is objected to, of equal parts of\\nboracic acid and carbonate of zinc. Immersion of the penis in a bath of\\neusol for some hours daily is useful. The sore is then covered with a\\npiece of gauze kept in position by drawing the prepuce over it, or by a\\nfew turns of a narrow bandage. Sublimed sulphur frequently rubbed into\\nthe sore is recommended by C. H. Mills. If the sores spread in spite of\\nthis, they should be painted with cocaine and then cauterised. When the\\nglands in the groin are infected, the patient must be confined to bed,\\nand a dressing impregnated with ichthyol and glycerin (10 per cent.)\\napplied; the repeated use of a suction bell is of great service.\\nHarrison recommends aspiration of a bubonic abscess, followed by\\ninjection of 1 in 20 solution of tincture of iodine into the cavity;\\nthis is in turn aspirated, and then 1 or 2 c.c. of the solution injected\\nand left in. This is repeated as often as the cavity refills. It is\\nsometimes necessary to let the pus out by one or more small incisions\\nand continue the use of the suction bell.\\n\\n_Diagnosis of Primary Syphilis._--In cases in which there is a history\\nof an incubation period of from three to five weeks, when the sore is\\nindurated, persistent, and indolent, and attended with bullet-buboes in\\nthe groin, the diagnosis of primary syphilis is not difficult. Owing,\\nhowever, to the great importance of instituting treatment at the\\nearliest possible stage of the infection, an effort should be made to\\nestablish the diagnosis without delay by demonstrating the spirochaete.\\nBefore any antiseptic is applied, the margin of the suspected sore is\\nrubbed with gauze, and the serum that exudes on pressure is collected\\nin a capillary tube and sent to a pathologist for microscopical\\nexamination. A better specimen can sometimes be obtained by puncturing\\nan enlarged lymph gland with a hypodermic needle, injecting a few minims\\nof sterile saline solution and then aspirating the blood-stained fluid.\\n\\nThe Wassermann test must not be relied upon for diagnosis in the early\\nstage, as it does not appear until the disease has become generalised\\nand the secondary manifestations are about to begin. The practice of\\nwaiting in doubtful cases before making a diagnosis until secondary\\nmanifestations appear is to be condemned.\\n\\nExtra-genital chancres, _e.g._ sores on the fingers of doctors or\\nnurses, are specially liable to be overlooked, if the possibility of\\nsyphilis is not kept in mind.\\n\\nIt is important to bear in mind _the possibility of a patient having\\nacquired a mixed infection_ with the virus of soft chancre, which will\\nmanifest itself a few days after infection, and the virus of syphilis,\\nwhich shows itself after an interval of several weeks. This occurrence\\nwas formerly the source of much confusion in diagnosis, and it was\\nbelieved at one time that syphilis might result from soft sores, but it\\nis now established that syphilis does not follow upon soft sores unless\\nthe virus of syphilis has been introduced at the same time. The\\npractitioner must be on his guard, therefore, when a patient asks his\\nadvice concerning a venereal sore which has appeared within a few days\\nof exposure to infection. Such a patient is naturally anxious to know\\nwhether he has contracted syphilis or not, but neither a positive nor a\\nnegative answer can be given--unless the spirochaete can be identified.\\n\\nSyphilis is also to be diagnosed from _epithelioma_, the common form of\\ncancer of the penis. It is especially in elderly patients with a tight\\nprepuce that the induration of syphilis is liable to be mistaken for\\nthat associated with epithelioma. In difficult cases the prepuce must be\\nslit open.\\n\\nDifficulty may occur in the diagnosis of primary syphilis from _herpes_,\\nas this may appear as late as ten days after connection; it commences as\\na group of vesicles which soon burst and leave shallow ulcers with a\\nyellow floor; these disappear quickly on the use of an antiseptic\\ndusting powder.\\n\\nApprehensive patients who have committed sexual indiscretions are apt to\\nregard as syphilitic any lesion which happens to be located on the\\npenis--for example, acne pustules, eczema, psoriasis papules, boils,\\nbalanitis, or venereal warts.\\n\\n_The local treatment_ of the primary sore consists in attempting to\\ndestroy the organisms _in situ_. An ointment made up of calomel 33\\nparts, lanoline 67 parts, and vaseline 10 parts (Metchnikoff\\'s cream) is\\nrubbed into the sore several times a day. If the surface is unbroken, it\\nmay be dusted lightly with a powder composed of equal parts of calomel\\nand carbonate of zinc. A gauze dressing is applied, and the penis and\\nscrotum should be supported against the abdominal wall by a triangular\\nhandkerchief or bathing-drawers; if there is inflammatory oedema the\\npatient should be confined to bed.\\n\\nIn _concealed chancres_ with phimosis, the sac of the prepuce should be\\nslit up along the dorsum to admit of the ointment being applied. If\\nphagedaena occurs, the prepuce must be slit open along the dorsum, or if\\nsloughing, cut away, and the patient should have frequent sitz baths of\\nweak sublimate lotion. When the chancre is within the meatus, iodoform\\nbougies are inserted into the urethra, and the urine should be rendered\\nbland by drinking large quantities of fluid.\\n\\nGeneral treatment is considered on p. 149.\\n\\n#Secondary Syphilis.#--The following description of secondary syphilis\\nis based on the average course of the disease in untreated cases. The\\nonset of constitutional symptoms occurs from six to twelve weeks after\\ninfection, and the manifestations are the result of the entrance of the\\nvirus into the general circulation, and its being carried to all parts\\nof the body. The period during which the patient is liable to suffer\\nfrom secondary symptoms ranges from six months to two years.\\n\\nIn some cases the general health is not disturbed; in others the patient\\nis feverish and out of sorts, losing appetite, becoming pale and anaemic,\\ncomplaining of lassitude, incapacity for exertion, headache, and pains\\nof a rheumatic type referred to the bones. There is a moderate degree of\\nleucocytosis, but the increase is due not to the polymorpho-nuclear\\nleucocytes but to lymphocytes. In isolated cases the temperature rises\\nto 101 o or 102 o F. and the patient loses flesh. The lymph glands,\\nparticularly those along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid,\\nbecome enlarged and slightly tender. The hair comes out, eruptions\\nappear on the skin and mucous membranes, and the patient may suffer from\\nsore throat and affections of the eyes. The local lesions are to be\\nregarded as being of the nature of reactions against accumulations of\\nthe parasite, lymphocytes and plasma cells being the elements chiefly\\nconcerned in the reactive process.\\n\\n_Affections of the Skin_ are among the most constant manifestations. An\\nevanescent macular rash, not unlike that of measles--_roseola_--is the\\nfirst to appear, usually in from six to eight weeks from the date of\\ninfection; it is widely diffused over the trunk, and the original dull\\nrose-colour soon fades, leaving brownish stains, which in time\\ndisappear. It is usually followed by a _papular eruption_, the\\nindividual papules being raised above the surface of the skin, smooth or\\nscaly, and as they are due to infiltration of the skin they are more\\npersistent than the roseoles. They vary in size and distribution, being\\nsometimes small, hard, polished, and closely aggregated like lichen,\\nsometimes as large as a shilling-piece, with an accumulation of scales\\non the surface like that seen in psoriasis. The co-existence of scaly\\npapules and faded roseoles is very suggestive of syphilis.\\n\\nOther types of eruption are less common, and are met with from the third\\nmonth onwards. A _pustular_ eruption, not unlike that of acne, is\\nsometimes a prominent feature, but is not characteristic of syphilis\\nunless it affects the scalp and forehead and is associated with the\\nremains of the papular eruption. The term _ecthyma_ is applied when the\\npustules are of large size, and, after breaking on the surface, give\\nrise to superficial ulcers; the discharge from the ulcer often dries up\\nand forms a scab or crust which is continually added to from below as\\nthe ulcer extends in area and depth. The term _rupia_ is applied when\\nthe crusts are prominent, dark in colour, and conical in shape, roughly\\nresembling the shell of a limpet. If the crust is detached, a sharply\\ndefined ulcer is exposed, and when this heals it leaves a scar which is\\nusually circular, thin, white, shining like satin, and the surrounding\\nskin is darkly pigmented; in the case of deep ulcers, the scar is\\ndepressed and adherent (Fig. 39).\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Syphilitic Rupia, showing the limpet-shaped\\ncrusts or scabs.]\\n\\nIn the later stages there may occur a form of creeping or _spreading\\nulceration of the skin_ of the face, groin, or scrotum, healing at one\\nedge and spreading at another like tuberculous lupus, but distinguished\\nfrom this by its more rapid progress and by the pigmentation of the\\nscar.\\n\\n_Condylomata_ are more characteristic of syphilis than any other type of\\nskin lesion. They are papules occurring on those parts of the body where\\nthe skin is habitually moist, and especially where two skin surfaces are\\nin contact. They are chiefly met with on the external genitals,\\nespecially in women, around the anus, beneath large pendulous mammae,\\nbetween the toes, and at the angles of the mouth, and in these\\nsituations their development is greatly favoured by neglect of\\ncleanliness. They present the appearance of well-defined circular or\\novoid areas in which the skin is thickened and raised above the surface;\\nthey are covered with a white sodden epidermis, and furnish a scanty but\\nvery infective discharge. Under the influence of irritation and want of\\nrest, as at the anus or at the angle of the mouth, they are apt to\\nbecome fissured and superficially ulcerated, and the discharge then\\nbecomes abundant and may crust on the surface, forming yellow scabs. At\\nthe angle of the mouth the condylomatous patches may spread to the\\ncheek, and when they ulcerate may leave fissure-like scars radiating\\nfrom the mouth--an appearance best seen in inherited syphilis (Fig. 44).\\n\\n_The Appendages of the Skin._--The _hair_ loses its gloss, becomes dry\\nand brittle, and readily falls out, either as an exaggeration of the\\nnormal shedding of the hair, or in scattered areas over the scalp\\n(_syphilitic alopoecia_). The hair is not re-formed in the scars which\\nresult from ulcerated lesions of the scalp. The _nail-folds_\\noccasionally present a pustular eruption and superficial ulceration, to\\nwhich the name _syphilitic onychia_ has been applied; more commonly the\\nnails become brittle and ragged, and they may even be shed.\\n\\n_The Mucous Membranes_, and especially those of the _mouth_ and\\n_throat_, suffer from lesions similar to those met with on the skin. On\\na mucous surface the papular eruption assumes the form of _mucous\\npatches_, which are areas with a congested base covered with a thin\\nwhite film of sodden epithelium like wet tissue-paper. They are best\\nseen on the inner aspect of the cheeks, the soft palate, uvula, pillars\\nof the fauces, and tonsils. In addition to mucous patches, there may be\\na number of small, _superficial, kidney-shaped ulcers_, especially along\\nthe margins of the tongue and on the tonsils. In the absence of mucous\\npatches and ulcers, the sore throat may be characterised by a bluish\\ntinge of the inflamed mucous membrane and a thin film of shed epithelium\\non the surface. Sometimes there is an elongated sinuous film which has\\nbeen likened to the track of a snail. In the _larynx_ the presence of\\ncongestion, oedema, and mucous patches may be the cause of persistent\\nhoarseness. The _tongue_ often presents a combination of lesions,\\nincluding ulcers, patches where the papillae are absent, fissures, and\\nraised white papules resembling warts, especially towards the centre of\\nthe dorsum. These lesions are specially apt to occur in those who smoke,\\ndrink undiluted alcohol or spirits, or eat hot condiments to excess, or\\nwho have irregular, sharp-cornered teeth. At a later period, and in\\nthose who are broken down in health from intemperance or other cause,\\nthe sore throat may take the form of rapidly spreading, penetrating\\nulcers in the soft palate and pillars of the fauces, which may lead to\\nextensive destruction of tissue, with subsequent scars and deformity\\nhighly characteristic of previous syphilis.\\n\\nIn the _Bones_, lesions occur which assume the clinical features of an\\nevanescent periostitis, the patient complaining of nocturnal pains over\\nthe frontal bone, sternum, tibiae, and ulnae, and localised tenderness on\\ntapping over these bones.\\n\\nIn the _Joints_, a serous synovitis or hydrops may occur, chiefly in the\\nknee, on one or on both sides.\\n\\n_The Affections of the Eyes_, although fortunately rare, are of great\\nimportance because of the serious results which may follow if they are\\nnot recognised and treated. _Iritis_ is the commonest of these, and may\\noccur in one or in both eyes, one after the other, from three to eight\\nmonths after infection. The patient complains of impairment of sight and\\nof frontal or supraorbital pain. The eye waters and is hypersensitive,\\nthe iris is discoloured and reacts sluggishly to light, and there is a\\nzone of ciliary congestion around the cornea. The appearance of minute\\nwhite nodules or flakes of lymph at the margin of the pupil is\\nespecially characteristic of syphilitic iritis. When adhesions have\\nformed between the iris and the structures in relation to it, the pupil\\ndilates irregularly under atropin. Although complete recovery is to be\\nexpected under early and energetic treatment, if neglected, _iritis_ may\\nresult in occlusion of the pupil and permanent impairment or loss of\\nsight.\\n\\nThe other lesions of the eye are much rarer, and can only be discovered\\non ophthalmoscopic examination.\\n\\nThe virus of syphilis exerts a special influence upon the _Blood\\nVessels_, exciting a proliferation of the endothelial lining which\\nresults in narrowing of their lumen, _endarteritis_, and a perivascular\\ninfiltration in the form of accumulations of plasma cells around the\\nvessels and in the lymphatics that accompany them.\\n\\nIn the _Brain_, in the later periods of secondary and in tertiary\\nsyphilis, changes occur as a result of the narrowing of the lumen of the\\narteries, or of their complete obliteration by thrombosis. By\\ninterfering with the nutrition of those parts of the brain supplied by\\nthe affected arteries, these lesions give rise to clinical features of\\nwhich severe headache and paralysis are the most prominent.\\n\\nAffections of the _Spinal Cord_ are extremely rare, but paraplegia from\\nmyelitis has been observed.\\n\\nLastly, attention must be directed to the remarkable variations observed\\nin different patients. Sometimes the virulent character of the disease\\ncan only be accounted for by an idiosyncrasy of the patient.\\nConstitutional symptoms, particularly pyrexia and anaemia, are most often\\nmet with in young women. Patients over forty years of age have greater\\ndifficulty in overcoming the infection than younger adults. Malarial and\\nother infections, and the conditions attending life in tropical\\ncountries, from the debility which they cause, tend to aggravate and\\nprolong the disease, which then assumes the characters of what has been\\ncalled _malignant syphilis_. All chronic ailments have a similar\\ninfluence, and alcoholic intemperance is universally regarded as a\\nserious aggravating factor.\\n\\n_Diagnosis of Secondary Syphilis._--A routine examination should be made\\nof the parts of the body which are most often affected in this\\ndisease--the scalp, mouth, throat, posterior cervical glands, and the\\ntrunk, the patient being stripped and examined by daylight. Among the\\n_diagnostic features of the skin affections_ the following may be\\nmentioned: They are frequently, and sometimes to a marked degree,\\nsymmetrical; more than one type of eruption--papules and pustules, for\\nexample--are present at the same time; there is little itching; they are\\nat first a dull-red colour, but later present a brown pigmentation which\\nhas been likened to the colour of raw ham; they exhibit a predilection\\nfor those parts of the forehead and neck which are close to the roots of\\nthe hair; they tend to pass off spontaneously; and they disappear\\nrapidly under treatment.\\n\\n#Serum Diagnosis--Wassermann Reaction.#--Wassermann found that if an\\nextract of syphilitic liver rich in spirochaetes is mixed with the serum\\nfrom a syphilitic patient, a large amount of complement is fixed. The\\napplication of the test is highly complicated and can only be carried\\nout by an expert pathologist. For the purpose he is supplied with from 5\\nc.c. to 10 c.c. of the patient\\'s blood, withdrawn under aseptic\\nconditions from the median basilic vein by means of a serum syringe, and\\ntransferred to a clean and dry glass tube. There is abundant evidence\\nthat the Wassermann test is a reliable means of establishing a diagnosis\\nof syphilis.\\n\\nA definitely positive reaction can usually be obtained between the\\nfifteenth and thirtieth day after the appearance of the primary lesion,\\nand as time goes on it becomes more marked. During the secondary period\\nthe reaction is practically always positive. In the tertiary stage also\\nit is positive except in so far as it is modified by the results of\\ntreatment. In para-syphilitic lesions such as general paralysis and\\ntabes a positive reaction is almost always present. In inherited\\nsyphilis the reaction is positive in every case. A positive reaction may\\nbe present in other diseases, for example, frambesia, trypanosomiasis,\\nand leprosy.\\n\\nAs the presence of the reaction is an evidence of the activity of the\\nspirochaetes, repeated applications of the test furnish a valuable means\\nof estimating the efficacy of treatment. The object aimed at is to\\nchange a persistently positive reaction to a permanently negative one.\\n\\n#Treatment of Syphilis.#--In the treatment of syphilis the two main\\nobjects are to maintain the general health at the highest possible\\nstandard, and to introduce into the system therapeutic agents which will\\ninhibit or destroy the invading parasite.\\n\\nThe second of these objects has been achieved by the researches of\\nEhrlich, who, in conjunction with his pupil, Hata, has built up a\\ncompound, the dihydrochloride of dioxydiamido-arseno-benzol, popularly\\nknown as salvarsan or \"606.\" Other preparations, such as kharsivan,\\narseno-billon, and diarsenol, are chemically equivalent to salvarsan,\\ncontaining from 27 to 31 per cent. of arsenic, and are equally\\nefficient. The full dose is 0.6 grm. All these members of the \"606\"\\ngroup form an acid solution when dissolved in water, and must be\\nrendered alkaline before being injected. As subcutaneous and\\nintra-muscular injections cause considerable pain, and may cause\\nsloughing of the tissues, \"606\" preparations must be injected\\nintravenously. Ehrlich has devised a preparation--neo-salvarsan, or\\n\"914,\" which is more easily prepared and forms a neutral solution. It\\ncontains from 18 to 20 per cent. of arsenic. Neo-kharsivan,\\nnovo-arseno-billon, and neo-diarsenol belong to the \"914\" group, the\\nfull dosage of which is 0.9 grm. As subcutaneous and intra-muscular\\ninjections of the \"914\" group are not painful, and even more efficient\\nthan intravenous injections, the administration is simpler.\\n\\nGalyl, luargol, and other preparations act in the same way as the \"606\"\\nand \"914\" groups.\\n\\nThe \"606\" preparations may be introduced into the veins by injection or\\nby means of an apparatus which allows the solution to flow in by\\ngravity. The left median basilic vein is selected, and a platino-iridium\\nneedle with a short point and a bore larger than that of the ordinary\\nhypodermic syringe is used. The needle is passed for a few millimetres\\nalong the vein, and the solution is then slowly introduced; before\\nwithdrawing the needle some saline is run in to diminish the risk of\\nthrombosis.\\n\\nThe \"914\" preparations may be injected either into the subcutaneous\\ntissue of the buttock or into the substance of the gluteus muscle. The\\npart is then massaged for a few minutes, and the massage is repeated\\ndaily for a few days.\\n\\nNo hard-and-fast rules can be laid down as to what constitutes a\\ncomplete course of treatment. Harrison recommends as a _minimum_ course\\nof one of the \"914\" preparations in _early primary cases_ an initial\\ndose of 0.45 grm. given intra-muscularly or into the deep subcutaneous\\ntissue; the same dose a week later; 0.6 grm. the following week; then\\nmiss a week and give 9.6 grms. on two successive weeks; then miss two\\nweeks and give 0.6 grm. on two more successive weeks.\\n\\nWhen a _positive Wassermann reaction_ is present before treatment is\\ncommenced, the above course is prolonged as follows: for three weeks is\\ngiven a course of potassium iodide, after which four more weekly\\ninjections of 0.6 grm. of \"914\" are given.\\n\\nWith each injection of \"914\" after the first, throughout the whole\\ncourse 1 grain of mercury is injected intra-muscularly.\\n\\nIn the course of a few hours, there is usually some indisposition, with\\na feeling of chilliness and slight rise of temperature; these symptoms\\npass off within twenty-four hours, and in a few days there is a decided\\nimprovement of health. Three or four days after an intra-muscular\\ninjection there may be pain and stiffness in the gluteal region.\\n\\nThese preparations are the most efficient therapeutic agents that have\\nyet been employed in the treatment of syphilis.\\n\\nThe manifestations of the disease disappear with remarkable rapidity.\\nObservations show that the spirochaetes lose their capacity for movement\\nwithin an hour or two of the administration, and usually disappear\\naltogether in from twenty-four to thirty-six hours. Wassermann\\'s\\nreaction usually yields a negative result in from three weeks to two\\nmonths, but later may again become positive. Subsequent doses of the\\narsenical preparation are therefore usually indicated, and should be\\ngiven in from 7 to 21 days according to the dose.\\n\\nWhen syphilis occurs in a _pregnant woman_, she should be given in the\\nearly months an ordinary course of \"914,\" followed by 10-grain doses of\\npotassium iodide twice daily. The injections may be repeated two months\\nlater, and during the remainder of the pregnancy 2-grain mercury pills\\nare given twice daily (A. Campbell). The presence of albumen in the\\nurine contra-indicates arsenical treatment.\\n\\nIt need scarcely be pointed out that the use of powerful drugs like\\n\"606\" and \"914\" is not free from risk; it may be mentioned that each\\ndose contains nearly three grains of arsenic. Before the administration\\nthe patient must be overhauled; its administration is contra-indicated\\nin the presence of disease of the heart and blood vessels, especially a\\ncombination of syphilitic aortitis and sclerosis of the coronary\\narteries, with degeneration of the heart muscle; in affections of the\\ncentral nervous system, especially advanced paralysis, and in such\\ndisturbances of metabolism as are associated with diabetes and Bright\\'s\\ndisease. Its use is not contra-indicated in any lesion of active\\nsyphilis.\\n\\nThe administration is controlled by the systematic examination of the\\nurine for arsenic.\\n\\n_The Administration of Mercury._--The success of the arsenical\\npreparations has diminished the importance of mercury in the treatment\\nof syphilis, but it is still used to supplement the effect of the\\ninjections. The amount of mercury to be given in any case must be\\nproportioned to the idiosyncrasies of the patient, and it is advisable,\\nbefore commencing the treatment, to test his urine and record his\\nbody-weight. The small amount of mercury given at the outset is\\ngradually increased. If the body-weight falls, or if the gums become\\nsore and the breath foul, the mercury should be stopped for a time. If\\nsalivation occurs, the drinking of hot water and the taking of hot baths\\nshould be insisted upon, and half-dram doses of the alkaline sulphates\\nprescribed.\\n\\n_Methods of Administering Mercury._--(1) _By the Mouth._--This was for\\nlong the most popular method in this country, the preparation usually\\nemployed being grey powder, in pills or tablets, each of which contains\\none grain of the powder. Three of these are given daily in the first\\ninstance, and the daily dose is increased to five or even seven grains\\ntill the standard for the individual patient is arrived at. As the grey\\npowder alone sometimes causes irritation of the bowels, it should be\\ncombined with iron, as in the following formula: Hydrarg. c. cret. gr. 1;\\nferri sulph. exsiccat. gr. 1 or 2.\\n\\n(2) _By Inunction._--Inunction consists in rubbing into the pores of the\\nskin an ointment composed of equal parts of 20 per cent. oleate of\\nmercury and lanolin. Every night after a hot bath, a dram of the\\nointment (made up by the chemist in paper packets) is rubbed for fifteen\\nminutes into the skin where it is soft and comparatively free from\\nhairs. When the patient has been brought under the influence of the\\nmercury, inunction may be replaced by one of the other methods, of\\nadministering the drug.\\n\\n(3) _By Intra-muscular Injection._--This consists in introducing the\\ndrug by means of a hypodermic syringe into the substance of the gluteal\\nmuscles. The syringe is made of glass, and has a solid glass piston; the\\nneedle of platino-iridium should be 5 cm. long and of a larger calibre\\nthan the ordinary hypodermic needle. The preparation usually employed\\nconsists of: metallic mercury or calomel 1 dram, lanolin and olive oil\\neach 2 drams; it must be warmed to allow of its passage through the\\nneedle. Five minims--containing one grain of metallic mercury--represent\\na dose, and this is injected into the muscles above and behind the great\\ntrochanter once a week. The contents of the syringe are slowly\\nexpressed, and, after withdrawing the needle, gentle massage of the\\nbuttock should be employed. Four courses each of ten injections are\\ngiven the first year, three courses of the same number during the second\\nand third years, and two courses during the fourth year (Lambkin).\\n\\n_The General Health._--The patient must lead a regular life and\\ncultivate the fresh-air habit, which is as beneficial in syphilis as in\\ntuberculosis. Anaemia, malaria, and other sources of debility must\\nreceive appropriate treatment. The diet should be simple and easily\\ndigested, and should include a full supply of milk. Alcohol is\\nprohibited. The excretory organs are encouraged to act by the liberal\\ndrinking of hot water between meals, say five or six tumblerfuls in the\\ntwenty-four hours. The functions of the skin are further aided by\\nfrequent hot baths, and by the wearing of warm underclothing. While the\\npatient should avoid exposure to cold, and taxing his energies by undue\\nexertion, he should be advised to take exercise in the open air. On\\naccount of the liability to lesions of the mouth and throat, he should\\nuse tobacco in moderation, his teeth should be thoroughly overhauled by\\nthe dentist, and he should brush them after every meal, using an\\nantiseptic tooth powder or wash. The mouth and throat should be rinsed\\nout night and morning with a solution of chlorate of potash and alum, or\\nwith peroxide of hydrogen.\\n\\n_Treatment of the Local Manifestations._--_The skin lesions_ are treated\\non the same lines as similar eruptions of other origin. As local\\napplications, preparations of mercury are usually selected, notably the\\nointments of the red oxide of mercury, ammoniated mercury, or oleate of\\nmercury (5 per cent.), or the mercurial plaster introduced by Unna. In\\nthe treatment of condylomata the greatest attention must be paid to\\ncleanliness and dryness. After washing and drying the affected patches,\\nthey are dusted with a powder consisting of equal parts of calomel and\\ncarbonate of zinc; and apposed skin surfaces, such as the nates or\\nlabia, are separated by sublimate wool. In the ulcers of later secondary\\nsyphilis, crusts are got rid of in the first instance by means of a\\nboracic poultice, after which a piece of lint or gauze cut to the size\\nof the ulcer and soaked in black wash is applied and covered with\\noil-silk. If the ulcer tends to spread in area or in depth, it should be\\nscraped with a sharp spoon, and painted over with acid nitrate of\\nmercury, or a local hyperaemia may be induced by Klapp\\'s suction\\napparatus.\\n\\n_In lesions of the mouth and throat_, the teeth should be attended to;\\nthe best local application is a solution of chromic acid--10 grains to\\nthe ounce--painted on with a brush once daily. If this fails, the\\nlesions may be dusted with calomel the last thing at night. For deep\\nulcers of the throat the patient should gargle frequently with chlorine\\nwater or with perchloride of mercury (1 in 2000); if the ulcer continues\\nto spread it should be painted with acid nitrate of mercury.\\n\\nIn the treatment of _iritis_ the eyes are shaded from the light and\\ncompletely rested, and the pupil is well dilated by atropin to prevent\\nadhesions. If there is much pain, a blister may be applied to the\\ntemple.\\n\\n_The Relations of Syphilis to Marriage._--Before the introduction of the\\nEhrlich-Hata treatment no patient was allowed to marry until three years\\nhad elapsed after the disappearance of the last manifestation. While\\nmarriage might be entered upon under these conditions without risk of\\nthe husband infecting the wife, the possibility of his conveying the\\ndisease to the offspring cannot be absolutely excluded. It is\\nrecommended, as a precautionary measure, to give a further mercurial\\ncourse of two or three months\\' duration before marriage, and an\\nintravenous injection of an arsenical preparation.\\n\\n#Intermediate Stage.#--After the dying away of the secondary\\nmanifestations and before the appearance of tertiary lesions, the\\npatient may present certain symptoms which Hutchinson called\\n_reminders_. These usually consist of relapses of certain of the\\naffections of the skin, mouth, or throat, already described. In the\\nskin, they may assume the form of peeling patches in the palms, or may\\nappear as spreading and confluent circles of a scaly papular eruption,\\nwhich if neglected may lead to the formation of fissures and superficial\\nulcers. Less frequently there is a relapse of the eye affections, or of\\nparalytic symptoms from disease of the cerebral arteries.\\n\\n#Tertiary Syphilis.#--While the manifestations of primary and secondary\\nsyphilis are common, those of the tertiary period are by comparison\\nrare, and are observed chiefly in those who have either neglected\\ntreatment or who have had their powers of resistance lowered by\\nprivation, by alcoholic indulgence, or by tropical disease.\\n\\nIt is to be borne in mind that in a certain proportion of men and in a\\nlarger proportion of women, the patient has no knowledge of having\\nsuffered from syphilis. Certain slight but important signs may give the\\nclue in a number of cases, such as irregularity of the pupils or failure\\nto react to light, abnormality of the reflexes, and the discovery of\\npatches of leucoplakia on the tongue, cheek, or palate.\\n\\nThe _general character of tertiary manifestations_ may be stated as\\nfollows: They attack by preference the tissues derived from the\\nmesoblastic layer of the embryo--the cellular tissue, bones, muscles,\\nand viscera. They are often localised to one particular tissue or organ,\\nsuch, for example, as the subcutaneous cellular tissue, the bones, or\\nthe liver, and they are rarely symmetrical. They are usually aggressive\\nand persistent, with little tendency to natural cure, and they may be\\ndangerous to life, because of the destructive changes produced in such\\norgans as the brain or the larynx. They are remarkably amenable to\\ntreatment if instituted before the stage which is attended with\\ndestruction of tissue is reached. Early tertiary lesions may be\\ninfective, and the disease may be transmitted by the discharges from\\nthem; but the later the lesions the less is the risk of their containing\\nan infective virus.\\n\\nThe most prominent feature of tertiary syphilis consists in the\\nformation of granulation tissue, and this takes place on a scale\\nconsiderably larger than that observed in lesions of the secondary\\nperiod. The granulation tissue frequently forms a definite swelling or\\ntumour-like mass (syphiloma), which, from its peculiar elastic\\nconsistence, is known as a _gumma_. In its early stages a gumma is a\\nfirm, semi-translucent greyish or greyish-red mass of tissue; later it\\nbecomes opaque, yellow, and caseous, with a tendency to soften and\\nliquefy. The gumma does harm by displacing and replacing the normal\\ntissue elements of the part affected, and by involving these in the\\ndegenerative changes, of the nature of caseation and necrosis, which\\nproduce the destructive lesions of the skin, mucous membranes, and\\ninternal organs. This is true not only of the circumscribed gumma, but\\nof the condition known as _gummatous infiltration_ or _syphilitic\\ncirrhosis_, in which the granulation tissue is diffused throughout the\\nconnective-tissue framework of such organs as the tongue or liver. Both\\nthe gummatous lesions and the fibrosis of tertiary syphilis are directly\\nexcited by the spirochaetes.\\n\\nThe life-history of an untreated gumma varies with its environment. When\\nprotected from injury and irritation in the substance of an internal\\norgan such as the liver, it may become encapsulated by fibrous tissue,\\nand persist in this condition for an indefinite period, or it may be\\nabsorbed and leave in its place a fibrous cicatrix. In the interior of a\\nlong bone it may replace the rigid framework of the shaft to such an\\nextent as to lead to pathological fracture. If it is near the surface of\\nthe body--as, for example, in the subcutaneous or submucous cellular\\ntissue, or in the periosteum of a superficial bone, such as the palate,\\nthe skull, or the tibia--the tissue of which it is composed is apt to\\nundergo necrosis, in which the overlying skin or mucous membrane\\nfrequently participates, the result being an ulcer--the tertiary\\nsyphilitic ulcer (Figs. 40 and 41).\\n\\n_Tertiary Lesions of the Skin and Subcutaneous Cellular Tissue._--The\\nclinical features of a _subcutaneous gumma_ are those of an indolent,\\npainless, elastic swelling, varying in size from a pea to an almond or\\nwalnut. After a variable period it usually softens in the centre, the\\nskin over it becomes livid and dusky, and finally separates as a slough,\\nexposing the tissue of the gumma, which sometimes appears as a mucoid,\\nyellowish, honey-like substance, more frequently as a sodden, caseated\\ntissue resembling wash-leather. The caseated tissue of a gumma differs\\nfrom that of a tuberculous lesion in being tough and firm, of a buff\\ncolour like wash-leather, or whitish, like boiled fish. The degenerated\\ntissue separates slowly and gradually, and in untreated cases may be\\nvisible for weeks in the floor of the ulcer.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Ulcerating Gumma of Lips.\\n\\n(From a photograph lent by Dr. Stopford Taylor and Dr. R. W. Mackenna.)]\\n\\n_The tertiary ulcer_ may be situated anywhere, but is most frequently\\nmet with on the leg, especially in the region of the knee (Fig. 42) and\\nover the calf. There may be one or more ulcers, and also scars of\\nantecedent ulcers. The edges are sharply cut, as if punched out; the\\nmargins are rounded in outline, firm, and congested; the base is\\noccupied by gummatous tissue, or, if this has already separated and\\nsloughed out, by unhealthy granulations and a thick purulent discharge.\\nWhen the ulcer has healed it leaves a scar which is depressed, and if\\nover a bone, is adherent to it. The features of the tertiary ulcer,\\nhowever, are not always so characteristic as the above description would\\nimply. It is to be diagnosed from the \"leg ulcer,\" which occurs almost\\nexclusively on the lower third of the leg; from Bazin\\'s disease (p. 74);\\nfrom the ulcers that result from certain forms of malignant disease,\\nsuch as rodent cancer, and from those met with in chronic glanders.\\n\\n_Gummatous Infiltration of the Skin_ (\"Syphilitic Lupus\").--This is a\\nlesion, met with chiefly on the face and in the region of the external\\ngenitals, in which the skin becomes infiltrated with granulation tissue\\nso that it is thickened, raised above the surface, and of a brownish-red\\ncolour. It appears as isolated nodules, which may fuse together; the\\nepidermis becomes scaly and is shed, giving rise to superficial ulcers\\nwhich are usually covered by crusted discharge. The disease tends to\\nspread, creeping over the skin with a serpiginous, crescentic, or\\nhorse-shoe margin, while the central portion may heal and leave a scar.\\nFrom the fact of its healing in the centre while it spreads at the\\nmargin, it may resemble tuberculous disease of the skin. It can usually\\nbe differentiated by observing that the infiltration is on a larger\\nscale; the progress is much more rapid, involving in the course of\\nmonths an area which in the case of tuberculosis would require as many\\nyears; the scars are sounder and are less liable to break down again;\\nand the disease rapidly yields to anti-syphilitic treatment.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Ulceration of nineteen year\\'s duration\\nin a woman aet. 24, the subject of inherited syphilis, showing active\\nulceration, cicatricial contraction, and sabre-blade deformity of\\ntibiae.]\\n\\n_Tertiary lesions of mucous membrane and of the submucous cellular\\ntissue_ are met with chiefly in the tongue, nose, throat, larynx, and\\nrectum. They originate as gummata or as gummatous infiltrations, which\\nare liable to break down and lead to the formation of ulcers which may\\nprove locally destructive, and, in such situations as the larynx, even\\ndangerous to life. In the tongue the tertiary ulcer may prove the\\nstarting-point of cancer; and in the larynx or rectum the healing of the\\nulcer may lead to cicatricial stenosis.\\n\\nTertiary lesions of the _bones and joints_, of the _muscles_, and of the\\n_internal organs_, will be described under these heads. The part played\\nby syphilis in the production of disease of arteries and of aneurysm\\nwill be referred to along with diseases of blood vessels.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Tertiary Syphilitic Ulceration in region of\\nKnee and on both Thumbs of woman aet. 37.]\\n\\n_Treatment._--The most valuable drugs for the treatment of the\\nmanifestations of the tertiary period are the arsenical preparations and\\nthe iodides of sodium and potassium. On account of their depressing\\neffects, the latter are frequently prescribed along with carbonate of\\nammonium. The dose is usually a matter of experiment in each individual\\ncase; 5 grains three times a day may suffice, or it may be necessary to\\nincrease each dose to 20 or 25 grains. The symptoms of iodism which may\\nfollow from the smaller doses usually disappear on giving a larger\\namount of the drug. It should be taken after meals, with abundant water\\nor other fluid, especially if given in tablet form. It is advisable to\\ncontinue the iodides for from one to three months after the lesions for\\nwhich they are given have cleared up. If the potassium salt is not\\ntolerated, it may be replaced by the ammonium or sodium iodide.\\n\\n_Local Treatment._--The absorption of a subcutaneous gumma is often\\nhastened by the application of a fly-blister. When a gumma has broken on\\nthe surface and caused an ulcer, this is treated on general principles,\\nwith a preference, however, for applications containing mercury or\\niodine, or both. If a wet dressing is required to cleanse the ulcer,\\nblack wash may be used; if a powder to promote dryness, one containing\\niodoform; if an ointment is indicated, the choice lies between the red\\noxide of mercury or the dilute nitrate of mercury ointment, and one\\nconsisting of equal parts of lanolin and vaselin with 2 per cent. of\\niodine. Deep ulcers, and obstinate lesions of the bones, larynx, and\\nother parts may be treated by excision or scraping with the sharp spoon.\\n\\n#Second Attacks of Syphilis.#--Instances of re-infection of syphilis\\nhave been recorded with greater frequency since the more general\\nintroduction of arsenical treatment. A remarkable feature in such cases\\nis the shortness of the interval between the original infection and the\\nalleged re-infection; in a recent series of twenty-eight cases, this\\ninterval was less than a year. Another feature of interest is that when\\npatients in the tertiary stage of syphilis are inoculated with the virus\\nfrom lesions from these in the primary and secondary stage lesions of\\nthe tertiary type are produced.\\n\\nReference may be made to the #relapsing false indurated chancre#,\\ndescribed by Hutchinson and by Fournier, as it may be the source of\\ndifficulty in diagnosis. A patient who has had an infecting chancre one\\nor more years before, may present a slightly raised induration on the\\npenis at or close to the site of his original sore. This relapsed\\ninduration is often so like that of a primary chancre that it is\\nimpossible to distinguish between them, except by the history. If there\\nhas been a recent exposure to venereal infection, it is liable to be\\nregarded as the primary lesion of a second attack of syphilis, but the\\nfurther progress shows that neither bullet-buboes nor secondary\\nmanifestations develop. These facts, together with the disappearance of\\nthe induration under treatment, make it very likely that the lesion is\\nreally gummatous in character.\\n\\n\\nINHERITED SYPHILIS\\n\\nOne of the most striking features of syphilis is that it may be\\ntransmitted from infected parents to their offspring, the children\\nexhibiting the manifestations that characterise the acquired form of the\\ndisease.\\n\\nThe more recent the syphilis in the parent, the greater is the risk of\\nthe disease being communicated to the offspring; so that if either\\nparent suffers from secondary syphilis the infection is almost\\ninevitably transmitted.\\n\\nWhile it is certain that either parent may be responsible for\\ntransmitting the disease to the next generation, the method of\\ntransmission is not known. In the case of a syphilitic mother it is most\\nprobable that the infection is conveyed to the foetus by the placental\\ncirculation. In the case of a syphilitic father, it is commonly believed\\nthat the infection is conveyed to the ovum through the seminal fluid at\\nthe moment of conception. If a series of children, one after the other,\\nsuffer from inherited syphilis, it is almost invariably the case that\\nthe mother has been infected.\\n\\nIn contrast to the acquired form, inherited syphilis is remarkable for\\nthe absence of any primary stage, the infection being a general one from\\nthe outset. The spirochaete is demonstrated in incredible numbers in the\\nliver, spleen, lung, and other organs, and in the nasal secretion, and,\\nfrom any of these, successful inoculations in monkeys can readily be\\nmade. The manifestations differ in degree rather than in kind from those\\nof the acquired disease; the difference is partly due to the fact that\\nthe virus is attacking developing instead of fully formed tissues.\\n\\nThe virus exercises an injurious influence on the foetus, which in many\\ncases dies during the early months of intra-uterine life, so that\\nmiscarriage results, and this may take place in repeated pregnancies,\\nthe date at which the miscarriage occurs becoming later as the virus in\\nthe mother becomes attenuated. Eventually a child is carried to full\\nterm, and it may be still-born, or, if born alive, may suffer from\\nsyphilitic manifestations. It is difficult to explain such vagaries of\\nsyphilitic inheritance as the infection of one twin and the escape of\\nthe other.\\n\\n_Clinical Features._--We are not here concerned with the severe forms of\\nthe disease which prove fatal, but with the milder forms in which the\\ninfant is apparently healthy when born, but after from two to six weeks\\nbegins to show evidence of the syphilitic taint.\\n\\nThe usual phenomena are that the child ceases to thrive, becomes thin\\nand sallow, and suffers from eruptions on the skin and mucous membranes.\\nThere is frequently a condition known as _snuffles_, in which the nasal\\npassages are obstructed by an accumulation of thin muco-purulent\\ndischarge which causes the breathing to be noisy. It usually begins\\nwithin a month after birth and before the eruptions on the skin appear.\\nWhen long continued it is liable to interfere with the development of\\nthe nasal bones, so that when the child grows up there results a\\ncondition known as the \"saddle-nose\" deformity (Figs. 43 and 44).\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Facies of Inherited Syphilis.\\n\\n(From Dr. Byrom Bramwell\\'s _Atlas of Clinical Medicine_.)]\\n\\n_Affections of the Skin._--Although all types of skin affection are met\\nwith in the inherited disease, the most important is a _papular_\\neruption, the papules being of large size, with a smooth shining top and\\nof a reddish-brown colour. It affects chiefly the buttocks and thighs,\\nthe genitals, and other parts which are constantly moist. It is\\nnecessary to distinguish this specific eruption from a form of eczema\\nwhich occurs in these situations in non-syphilitic children, the points\\nthat characterise the syphilitic condition being the infiltration of the\\nskin and the coppery colour of the eruption. At the anus the papules\\nacquire the characters of _condylomata_, also at the angles of the\\nmouth, where they often ulcerate and leave radiating scars.\\n\\n_Affections of the Mucous Membranes._--The inflammation of the nasal\\nmucous membrane that causes snuffles has already been referred to. There\\nmay be mucous patches in the mouth, or a stomatitis which is of\\nimportance, because it results in interference with the development of\\nthe permanent teeth. The mucous membrane of the larynx may be the seat\\nof mucous patches or of catarrh, and as a result the child\\'s cry is\\nhoarse.\\n\\n_Affections of the Bones._--Swellings at the ends of the long bones, due\\nto inflammation at the epiphysial junctions, are most often observed at\\nthe upper end of the humerus and in the bones in the region of the\\nelbow. Partial displacement and mobility at the ossifying junction may\\nbe observed. The infant cries when the part is touched; and as it does\\nnot move the limb voluntarily, the condition is spoken of as _the\\npseudo-paralysis of syphilis_. Recovery takes place under\\nanti-syphilitic treatment and immobilisation of the limb.\\n\\nDiffuse thickening of the shafts of the long bones, due to a deposit of\\nnew bone by the periosteum, is sometimes met with.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Facies of Inherited Syphilis.]\\n\\nThe conditions of the skull known as Parrot\\'s nodes or bosses, and\\ncraniotabes, were formerly believed to be characteristic of inherited\\nsyphilis, but they are now known to occur, particularly in rickety\\nchildren, from other causes. The _bosses_ result from the heaping up of\\nnew spongy bone beneath the pericranium, and they may be grouped\\nsymmetrically around the anterior fontanelle, or may extend along either\\nside of the sagittal suture, which appears as a deep groove--the\\n\"natiform skull.\" The bosses disappear in time, but the skull may remain\\npermanently altered in shape, the frontal and parietal eminences\\nappearing unduly prominent. The term _craniotabes_ is applied when the\\nbone becomes thin and soft, reverting to its original membranous\\ncondition, so that the affected areas dimple under the finger like\\nparchment or thin cardboard; its localisation in the posterior parts of\\nthe skull suggests that the disappearance of the osseous tissue is\\ninfluenced by the pressure of the head on the pillow. Craniotabes is\\nrecovered from as the child improves in health.\\n\\nBetween the ages of three and six months, certain other phenomena may be\\nmet with, such as _effusion into the joints_, especially the knees;\\n_iritis_, in one or in both eyes, and enlargement of the spleen and\\nliver.\\n\\nIn the majority of cases the child recovers from these early\\nmanifestations, especially when efficiently treated, and may enjoy an\\nindefinite period of good health. On the other hand, when it attains the\\nage of from two to four years, it may begin to manifest lesions which\\ncorrespond to those of the tertiary period of acquired syphilis.\\n\\n#Later Lesions.#--In the skin and subcutaneous tissue, the later\\nmanifestations may take the form of localised gummata, which tend to\\nbreak down and form ulcers, on the leg for example, or of a spreading\\ngummatous infiltration which is also liable to ulcerate, leaving\\ndisfiguring scars, especially on the face. The palate and fauces may be\\ndestroyed by ulceration. In the nose, especially when the ulcerative\\nprocess is associated with a putrid discharge--ozaena--the destruction of\\ntissue may be considerable and result in unsightly deformity. The entire\\npalatal portions of the upper jaws, the vomer, turbinate, and other\\nbones bounding the nasal and oral cavities, may disappear, so that on\\nlooking into the mouth the base of the skull is readily seen. Gummatous\\ndisease is frequently observed also in the flat bones of the skull, in\\nthe bones of the hand, as syphilitic dactylitis, and in the bones of the\\nforearm and leg. When the tibia is affected the disease is frequently\\nbilateral, and may assume the form of gummatous ulcers and sinuses. In\\nlater years the tibia may present alterations in shape resulting from\\nantecedent gummatous disease--for example, nodular thickenings of the\\nshaft, flattening of the crest, or a more uniform increase in thickness\\nand length of the shaft of the bone, which, when it is curved in\\naddition, is described as the \"sabre-blade\" deformity. Among lesions of\\nthe viscera, mention should be made of gumma of the testis, which causes\\nthe organ to become enlarged, uneven, and indurated. This has even been\\nobserved in infants a few months old.\\n\\nOccasionally a syphilitic child suffers from a succession of these\\ngummatous lesions with resulting ill-health, and, it may be, waxy\\ndisease of the internal organs; on the other hand, it may recover and\\npresent no further manifestations of the inherited taint.\\n\\n_Affections of the Eyes._--At or near puberty there is frequently\\nobserved an affection of the eyes, known as _chronic interstitial\\nkeratitis_, the relationship of which to inherited syphilis was first\\nestablished by Hutchinson. It occurs between the ages of six and sixteen\\nyears, and usually affects one eye before the other. It commences as a\\ndiffuse haziness or steaminess near the centre of the cornea, and as it\\nspreads the entire cornea assumes the appearance of ground glass. The\\nchief complaint is of dimness of sight, which may almost amount to\\nblindness, but there is little pain or photophobia; a certain amount of\\nconjunctival and ciliary congestion is usually present, and there may be\\n_iritis_ in addition. The cornea, or parts of it, may become of a deep\\npink or salmon colour from the formation in it of new blood vessels. The\\naffection may last for from eighteen months to two years. Complete\\nrecovery usually takes place, but slight opacities, especially in the\\nsite of former salmon patches, may persist, and the disease occasionally\\nrelapses. _Choroiditis_ and _retinitis_ may also occur, and leave\\npermanent changes easily recognised on examination with the\\nophthalmoscope.\\n\\nAmong the rarer and more serious lesions of the inherited disease may be\\nmentioned gummatous disease in the _larynx and trachea_, attended with\\nulceration and resulting in stenosis; and lesions of the _nervous\\nsystem_ which may result in convulsions, paralysis, or dementia.\\n\\nIn a limited number of cases, about the period of puberty there may\\ndevelop _deafness_, which is usually bilateral and may become absolute.\\n\\n_Changes in the Permanent Teeth._--These affect specially the upper\\ncentral incisors, which are dwarfed and stand somewhat apart in the gum,\\nwith their free edges converging towards one another. They are tapering\\nor peg-shaped, and present at their cutting margin a deep semilunar\\nnotch. These appearances are commonly associated with the name of\\nHutchinson, who first described them. Affecting as they do the\\npermanent teeth, they are not available for diagnosis until the child is\\nover eight years of age. Henry Moon drew attention to a change in the\\nfirst molars; these are reduced in size and dome-shaped through dwarfing\\nof the central tubercle of each cusp.\\n\\n#Diagnosis of Inherited Syphilis.#--When there is a typical eruption on\\nthe buttocks and snuffles there is no difficulty in recognising the\\ndisease. When, however, the rash is scanty or is obscured by co-existing\\neczema, most reliance should be placed on the distribution of the\\neruption, on the brown stains which are left after it has passed off, on\\nthe presence of condylomata, and of fissuring and scarring at the angles\\nof the mouth. The history of the mother relative to repeated\\nmiscarriages and still-born children may afford confirmatory evidence.\\nIn doubtful cases, the diagnosis may be aided by the Wassermann test and\\nby noting the therapeutic effects of grey powder, which, in syphilitic\\ninfants, usually effects a marked and rapid improvement both in the\\nsymptoms and in the general health.\\n\\nWhile a considerable number of syphilitic children grow up without\\nshowing any trace of their syphilitic inheritance, the majority retain\\nthroughout life one or more of the following characteristics, which may\\ntherefore be described as _permanent signs of the inherited disease_:\\nDwarfing of stature from interference with growth at the epiphysial\\njunctions; the forehead low and vertical, and the parietal and frontal\\neminences unduly prominent; the bridge of the nose sunken and rounded;\\nradiating scars at the angles of the mouth; perforation or destruction\\nof the hard palate; Hutchinson\\'s teeth; opacities of the cornea from\\nantecedent keratitis; alterations in the fundus oculi from choroiditis;\\ndeafness; depressed scars or nodes on the bones from previous gummata;\\n\"sabre-blade\" or other deformity of the tibiae.\\n\\n#The Contagiousness of Inherited Syphilis.#--In 1837, Colles of Dublin\\nstated his belief that, while a syphilitic infant may convey the disease\\nto a healthy wet nurse, it is incapable of infecting its own mother if\\nnursed by her, even although she may never have shown symptoms of the\\ndisease. This doctrine, which is known as _Colles\\' law_, is generally\\naccepted in spite of the alleged occurrence of occasional exceptions.\\nThe older the child, the less risk there is of its communicating the\\ndisease to others, until eventually the tendency dies out altogether, as\\nit does in the tertiary period of acquired syphilis. It should be\\nadded, however, that the contagiousness of inherited syphilis is denied\\nby some observers, who affirm that, when syphilitic infants prove\\ninfective, the disease has been really acquired at or soon after birth.\\n\\nThere is general agreement that the subjects of inherited syphilis\\ncannot transmit the disease by inheritance to their offspring, and that,\\nalthough they very rarely acquire the disease _de novo_, it is possible\\nfor them to do so.\\n\\n#Prognosis of Inherited Syphilis.#--Although inherited syphilis is\\nresponsible for a large but apparently diminishing mortality in infancy,\\nthe subjects of this disease may grow up to be as strong and healthy as\\ntheir neighbours. Hutchinson insisted on the fact that there is little\\nbad health in the general community that can be attributed to inherited\\nsyphilis.\\n\\n#Treatment.#--Arsenical injections are as beneficial in the inherited as\\nin the acquired disease. An infant the subject of inherited syphilis\\nshould, if possible, be nursed by its mother, and failing this it should\\nbe fed by hand. In infants at the breast, the drug may be given to the\\nmother; in others, it is administered in the same manner as already\\ndescribed--only in smaller doses. On the first appearance of syphilitic\\nmanifestations it should be given 0.05 grm, novarsenbillon, injected\\ninto the deep subcutaneous tissues every week for six weeks, followed by\\none year\\'s mercurial inunction--a piece of mercurial ointment the size\\nof a pea being inserted under the infant\\'s binder. In older children the\\ndose is proportionately increased. The general health should be improved\\nin every possible direction; considerable benefit may be derived from\\nthe use of cod-liver oil, and from preparations containing iron and\\ncalcium. Surgical interference may be required in the destructive\\ngummatous lesions of the nose, throat, larynx, and bones, either with\\nthe object of arresting the spread of the disease, or of removing or\\nalleviating the resulting deformities. In children suffering from\\nkeratitis, the eyes should be protected from the light by smoked or\\ncoloured glasses, and the pupils should be dilated with atropin from\\ntime to time, especially in cases complicated with iritis.\\n\\n#Acquired Syphilis in Infants and Young Children.#--When syphilis is met\\nwith in infants and young children, it is apt to be taken for granted\\nthat the disease has been inherited. It is possible, however, for them\\nto acquire the disease--as, for example, while passing through the\\nmaternal passages during birth, through being nursed or kissed by\\ninfected women, or through the rite of circumcision. The risk of\\ninfection which formerly existed by the arm-to-arm method of\\nvaccination has been abolished by the use of calf lymph.\\n\\nThe clinical features of the acquired disease in infants and young\\nchildren are similar to those observed in the adult, with a tendency,\\nhowever, to be more severe, probably because the disease is often late\\nin being recognised and treated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nTUMOURS[2]\\n\\n\\nDefinition--Etiology--General characters of innocent and malignant\\n    tumours. CLASSIFICATION OF TUMOURS: I. Connective-tissue tumours:\\n    (1) _Innocent_: _Lipoma_, _Xanthoma_, _Chondroma_, _Osteoma_,\\n    _Odontoma_, _Fibroma_, _Myxoma_, _Endothelioma_, etc.; (2)\\n    _Malignant_: _Sarcoma_--II. Epithelial tumours: (1) _Innocent_:\\n    _Papilloma_, _Adenoma_, _Cystic Adenoma_; (2) _Malignant_:\\n    _Epithelioma_, _Glandular Cancer_, _Rodent Cancer_, _Melanotic\\n    Cancer_--III. Dermoids--IV. Teratoma. Cysts: _Retention_,\\n    _Exudation_, _Implantation_, _Parasitic_, _Lymphatic or Serous_.\\n    Ganglion.\\n\\n[2] For the histology of tumours the reader is referred to a text-book\\nof pathology.\\n\\nA tumour or neoplasm is a localised swelling composed of newly formed\\ntissue which fulfils no physiological function. Tumours increase in size\\nquite independently of the growth of the body, and there is no natural\\ntermination to their growth. They are to be distinguished from such\\nover-growths as are of the nature of simple hypertrophy or local\\ngiantism, and also from inflammatory swellings, which usually develop\\nunder the influence of a definite cause, have a natural termination, and\\ntend to disappear when the cause ceases to act.\\n\\nThe _etiology of tumours_ is imperfectly understood. Various factors,\\nacting either singly or in combination, may be concerned in their\\ndevelopment. Certain tumours, for example, are the result of some\\ncongenital malformation of the particular tissue from which they take\\norigin. This would appear to be the case in many tumours of blood\\nvessels (angioma), of cartilage (chondroma), of bone (osteoma), and of\\nsecreting gland tissue (adenoma). The theory that tumours originate from\\nfoetal residues or \"rests,\" is associated with the name of Cohnheim.\\nThese rests are supposed to be undifferentiated embryonic cells which\\nremain embedded amongst fully formed tissue elements, and lie dormant\\nuntil they are excited into active growth and give rise to a tumour.\\nThis mode of origin is illustrated by the development of dermoids from\\nsequestrated portions of epidermis.\\n\\nAmong the local factors concerned in the development of tumours,\\nreference must be made to the influence of irritation. This is probably\\nan important agent in the causation of many of the tumours met with in\\nthe skin and in mucous membranes--for example, cancer of the skin, of\\nthe lip, and of the tongue. The part played by injury is doubtful. It\\nnot infrequently happens that the development of a tumour is preceded by\\nan injury of the part in which it grows, but it does not necessarily\\nfollow that the injury and the tumour are related as cause and effect.\\nIt is possible that an injury may stimulate into active growth\\nundifferentiated tissue elements or \"rests,\" and so determine the growth\\nof a tumour, or that it may alter the characters of a tumour which\\nalready exists, causing it to grow more rapidly.\\n\\nThe popular belief that there is some constitutional peculiarity\\nconcerned in the causation of tumours is largely based on the fact that\\ncertain forms of new growth--for example, cancer--are known to occur\\nwith undue frequency in certain families. The same influence is more\\nstriking in the case of certain innocent tumours--particularly multiple\\nosteomas and lipomas--which are hereditary in the same sense as\\nsupernumerary or webbed fingers, and appear in members of the same\\nfamily through several generations.\\n\\n\\nINNOCENT AND MALIGNANT TUMOURS\\n\\nFor clinical purposes, tumours are arbitrarily divided into two\\nclasses--the innocent and the malignant. The outstanding difference\\nbetween them is, that while the evil effects of innocent tumours are\\nentirely local and depend for their severity on the environment of the\\ngrowth, malignant tumours wherever situated, in addition to producing\\nsimilar local effects, injure the general health and ultimately cause\\ndeath.\\n\\n_Innocent_, benign, or simple tumours present a close structural\\nresemblance to the normal tissues of the body. They grow slowly, and are\\nusually definitely circumscribed by a fibrous capsule, from which they\\nare easily enucleated, and they do not tend to recur after removal. In\\ntheir growth they merely push aside and compress adjacent parts, and\\nthey present no tendency to ulcerate and bleed unless the overlying skin\\nor mucous membrane is injured. Although usually solitary, some are\\nmultiple from the outset--for example, fatty, fibrous, and bony tumours,\\nwarts, and fibroid tumours of the uterus. They produce no constitutional\\ndisturbance. They only threaten life when growing in the vicinity of\\nvital organs, and then only in virtue of their situation--for example,\\ndeath may result from an innocent tumour in the air-passage causing\\nsuffocation, in the intestine causing obstruction of the bowels, or in\\nthe vertebral canal causing pressure on the spinal medulla.\\n\\n_Malignant tumours_ usually show a marked departure from the structure\\nand arrangement of the normal tissues of the body. Although the cells of\\nwhich they are composed are derived from normal tissue cells, they tend\\nto take on a lower, more vegetative form; they may be regarded as\\nparasites living at the expense of the organism, multiplying\\nindefinitely and destroying everything with which they come in contact.\\n\\nMalignant tumours grow more rapidly than innocent tumours, and tend to\\ninfiltrate their surroundings by sending out prolongations or offshoots;\\nthey are therefore liable to recur after an operation which is\\nrestricted to the removal of the main tumour. They are not encapsulated,\\nalthough they may appear to be circumscribed by condensation of the\\nsurrounding tissues; they are rarely multiple at the outset, but show a\\nmarked tendency to spread to other parts of the body. Fragments of the\\nparent tumour may become separated and be carried off in the lymph or\\nblood-stream and deposited in other parts of the body, where they give\\nrise to secondary growths. Malignant tumours tend to invade and destroy\\nthe overlying skin or mucous membrane, and thus give rise to bleeding\\nulcers; if the tumour tissue protrudes through the gap in the skin, it\\nis said to _fungate_. In course of time they give rise to a condition of\\nill-health or _cachexia_, the patient becoming pale, sallow, feverish,\\nand emaciated, probably as a result of chronic poisoning from the\\nabsorption of toxic products from the tumour. They ultimately destroy\\nlife, it may be by their local effects, such as ulceration and\\nhaemorrhage, by favouring the entrance of septic infection, by\\ninterfering with the function of organs which are essential to life, by\\ncachexia, or by a combination of these effects.\\n\\nThe situation of a malignant tumour exercises considerable influence on\\nthe rapidity, as well as on the mode, in which it causes death. Some\\ncancers, such as that known as \"rodent,\" show malignant features which\\nare entirely local, while others, such as melanotic cancer, exhibit a\\nmalignancy characterised by rapid generalisation of growths throughout\\nthe body. Tumours that are structurally alike may show variations in\\nmalignancy, according to their situation and to the age of the patient,\\nas well as to other factors which are as yet unknown.\\n\\nIn attempting to arrive at a conclusion as to the innocence or\\nmalignancy of any tumour, too much reliance must not be placed on its\\nhistological features; its situation, rate of growth, and other clinical\\nfeatures must also be taken into consideration. It cannot be too\\nemphatically stated that there is no hard-and-fast line between innocent\\nand malignant growths; there is an indefinite transition from one to the\\nother. The possibility of the transformation of a benign into a\\nmalignant tumour must be admitted. Such a transformation implies a\\nchange in the structure of the growth, and has been observed especially\\nin fibrous and cartilaginous tumours, in tumours of the thyreoid gland,\\nand in uterine fibroids. The alteration in character may take place\\nunder the influence of injury, prolonged or repeated irritation,\\nincomplete removal of the benign tumour by operation, or the altered\\nphysiological conditions of the tissues which attend upon advancing\\nyears.\\n\\nAfter a tumour has been removed by operation it should as a routine\\nmeasure be subjected to microscopical examination; the results are often\\ninstructive and sometimes other than what was expected.\\n\\n#Varieties of Tumours.#--In the following description, tumours are\\nclassified on an anatomical basis, taking in order first the\\nconnective-tissue group and subsequently those that originate in\\nepithelium.\\n\\n\\nINNOCENT CONNECTIVE-TISSUE TUMOURS\\n\\n#Lipoma.#--A lipoma is composed of fat resembling that normally present\\nin the body. The commonest variety is the _subcutaneous lipoma_, which\\ngrows from the subcutaneous fat, and forms a soft, irregularly lobulated\\ntumour (Fig. 45). The fat is arranged in lobules separated by\\nconnective-tissue septa, which are continuous with the capsule\\nsurrounding the tumour and with the overlying skin, which becomes\\ndimpled or puckered when an attempt is made to pinch it up. As the fat\\nis almost fluid at the body temperature, fluctuation can usually be\\ndetected. These tumours vary greatly in size, occur at all ages, grow\\nslowly, and, while generally solitary, are sometimes multiple. They are\\nmost commonly met with on the shoulder, buttock, or back. In certain\\nsituations, such as the thigh and perineum, they tend to become\\npedunculated (Fig. 46).\\n\\nA fatty tumour is to be diagnosed from a cold abscess and from a cyst.\\nThe distinguishing features of the lipoma are the tacking down and\\ndimpling of the overlying skin, the lobulation of the tumour, which is\\nrecognised when it is pressed upon with the flat of the hand, and, more\\nreliable than either of these, the mobility, the tumour slipping away\\nwhen pressed upon at its margin.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Subcutaneous Lipoma showing lobulation.]\\n\\nThe prognosis is more favourable than in any other tumour as it never\\nchanges its characters; the only reasons for its removal by operation\\nare its unsightliness and its probable increase in size in the course of\\nyears. The operation consists in dividing the skin and capsule over the\\ntumour and shelling it out. Care must be taken that none of the outlying\\nlobules are left behind. If the overlying skin is damaged or closely\\nadherent, it should be removed along with the tumour.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Pedunculated Lipoma of Buttock of forty years\\'\\nduration in a woman aet. 68.]\\n\\n_Multiple subcutaneous lipomas_ are frequently symmetrical, and in a\\ncertain group of cases, met with chiefly in women, pain is a prominent\\nsymptom, hence the term _adiposis dolorosa_ (Dercum). These multiple\\ntumours show little or no tendency to increase in size, and the pain\\nwhich attends their development does not persist.\\n\\nIn the neck, axilla, and pubes a diffuse overgrowth of the subcutaneous\\nfat is sometimes met with, forming symmetrical tumour-like masses, known\\nas _diffuse lipoma_. As this is not, strictly speaking, a tumour, the\\nterm _diffuse lipomatosis_ is to be preferred. A similar condition was\\ndescribed by Jonathan Hutchinson as being met with in the domestic\\nanimals. If causing disfigurement, the mass of fat may be removed by\\noperation.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Diffuse Lipomatosis of Neck.]\\n\\n_Lipoma in other Situations._--The _periosteal lipoma_ is usually\\ncongenital, and is most often met with in the hand; it forms a\\nprojecting lobulated tumour, which, when situated in the palm, resembles\\nan angioma or a lymphangioma. The _subserous lipoma_ arises from the\\nextra-peritoneal fat in the posterior abdominal wall, in which case it\\ntends to grow forwards between the layers of the mesentery and to give\\nrise to an abdominal tumour; or it may grow from the extra-peritoneal\\nfat in the anterior abdominal wall and protrude from one of the hernial\\nopenings or through an abnormal opening in the parietes, constituting a\\n_fatty hernia_. A _subsynovial lipoma_ grows from the fat surrounding\\nthe synovial membrane of a joint, and projects into its interior, giving\\nrise to the symptoms of loose body. Lipomas are also met with growing\\nfrom the adipose connective tissue _between or in the substance of\\nmuscles_, and, when situated beneath the deep fascia, such as the fascia\\nlata of the thigh, the characteristic signs are obscured and a\\ndifferential diagnosis is difficult. It may be differentiated from a\\ncold abscess by puncture with an exploring needle.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Zanthoma of Hands in a girl aet. 14, showing\\nmultiple subcutaneous tumours (cf. Fig. 49).\\n\\n(Sir H. J. Stiles\\' case.)]\\n\\n#Zanthoma# is a rare but interesting form of tumour, composed of a\\nfibrous and fatty tissue, containing a granular orange-yellow pigment,\\nresembling that of the corpus luteum. It originates in the corium and\\npresents two clinical varieties. In the first of these, it occurs in the\\nform of raised yellow patches, usually in the skin of the eyelids of\\npersons after middle life, and in many instances is associated with\\nchronic jaundice; the patches are often symmetrical, and as they\\nincrease in size they tend to fuse with another.\\n\\nThe second form occurs in children and adolescents; it may affect\\nseveral generations of the same family, and is often multiple, there\\nbeing a combination of thickened yellow patches of skin and projecting\\ntumours, some of which may attain a considerable size (Figs. 48 and 49).\\nOn section, the tumour tissue presents a brilliant orange or saffron\\ncolour.\\n\\nThere is no indication for removing the tumours unless for the deformity\\nwhich they cause; exposure to the X-rays is to be preferred to\\noperation.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Zanthoma showing Subcutaneous Tumours on\\nButtocks. From same patient as Fig. 48.]\\n\\n#Chondroma.#--A chondroma is mainly composed of cartilage. Processes of\\nvascular connective tissue pass in between the nodules of cartilage\\ncomposing the tumour from the fibrous capsule which surrounds it. On\\nsection it is of a greyish-blue colour and semi-translucent. The tumour\\nis firm and elastic in consistence, but certain portions may be densely\\nhard from calcification or ossification, while other portions may be\\nsoft and fluctuating as a result of myxomatous degeneration and\\nliquefaction. These tumours grow slowly and painlessly, and may surround\\nnerves and arteries without injuring them. They may cause a deep hollow\\nin the bone from which they originate. All intermediate forms between\\nthe innocent chondroma and the malignant chondro-sarcoma are met with.\\nChondroma may occur in a multiple form, especially in relation to the\\nphalanges and metacarpal bones. When growing in the interior of a bone\\nit causes a spindle-shaped enlargement of the shaft, which in the case\\nof a phalanx or metacarpal bone may resemble the dactylitis resulting\\nfrom tubercle or syphilis. A chondroma appears as a clear area in a\\nskiagram.\\n\\nA _skiagram_ of a bone in which there is a chondroma shows a clear\\nrounded area in the position of the tumour, which must be differentiated\\nfrom similar clear areas due to other kinds of tumour, especially the\\nmyeloma; when it has undergone calcification or ossification, it gives a\\nshadow as dark as bone.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Chondroma growing from infraspinous fossa of\\nScapula.]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Chondroma of Metacarpal Bone of Thumb.]\\n\\n_Treatment._--In view of the unstable quality of the chondroma,\\nespecially of its liability to become malignant, it should be removed as\\nsoon as it is recognised. In those projecting from the surface of a\\nbone, both the tumour and its capsule should be removed. If in the\\ninterior, a sufficient amount of the cortex should be removed to allow\\nof the tumour being scraped out, and care must be taken that no nodules\\nof cartilage are left behind. In multiple chondromas of the hand, when\\nthe fingers are crippled and useless, exposure to the X-rays should be\\ngiven a trial, and in extreme cases the question of amputation may have\\nto be considered. When a cartilaginous tumour takes on active growth, it\\nmust be treated as malignant.\\n\\nThe chondromas that are met with at the ends of the long bones in\\nchildren and young adults form a group by themselves. They are usually\\nrelated to the epiphysial cartilage, and it was suggested by Virchow\\nthat they take origin from islands of cartilage which have not been used\\nup in the process of ossification. They are believed to occur more\\nfrequently in those who have suffered from rickets. They have no\\nmalignant tendencies and tend to undergo ossification concurrently with\\nthe epiphysial cartilage from which they take origin, and constitute\\nwhat are known as _cartilaginous exostoses_. These are sometimes met\\nwith in a multiple form, and may occur in several generations of the\\nsame family. They are considered in greater detail in the chapter\\ndealing with tumours of bone.\\n\\nMinute nodules of cartilage sometimes form in the synovial membrane of\\njoints and lining of tendon sheaths and bursae: they tend to become\\ndetached from the membrane and constitute loose bodies; they also\\nundergo a variable amount of calcification and ossification, so as to be\\nvisible in skiagrams. They are further considered with loose bodies in\\njoints.\\n\\nCartilaginous tumours in the parotid, submaxillary gland, and testicle\\nbelong to a class of \"mixed tumours\" that will be referred to later.\\n\\n#Osteoma.#--The true osteoma is composed of bony tissue, and originates\\nfrom the skeleton. Two varieties are recognised--the spongy or\\ncancellous, and the ivory or compact. The _spongy_ or _cancellous\\nosteoma_ is really an ossified chondroma, and is met with at the ends of\\nthe long bones (Fig. 52). From the fact that it projects from the\\nsurface of the bone it is often spoken of as an _exostosis_. It grows\\nslowly, and rarely causes any discomfort unless it presses upon a\\nnerve-trunk or upon a bursa which has developed over it. The Rontgen\\nrays show a dark shadow corresponding to the ossified portion of the\\ntumour, and continuous with that of the bone from which it is growing\\n(Fig. 138). Operative interference is only indicated when the tumour is\\ngiving rise to inconvenience. It is then removed, its base or neck being\\ndivided by means of the chisel. The multiple variety of osteoma is\\nconsidered with the diseases of bone.\\n\\nThe bony outgrowth from the terminal phalanx of the great toe--known as\\nthe _subungual exostosis_--is described and figured on p. 404. Bony\\nprojections or \"spurs\" sometimes occur on the under surface of the\\ncalcaneus, and, projecting downwards and forwards from the greater\\nprocess, cause pain on putting the heel to the ground.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Cancellous Osteoma of lower end of Femur.]\\n\\nThe _ivory_ or _compact osteoma_ is composed of dense bone, and usually\\ngrows from the skull. It is generally sessile and solitary, and may grow\\ninto the interior of the skull, into the frontal sinus, into the cavity\\nof the orbit or nose, or may fill up the external auditory meatus,\\ncausing most unsightly deformity and interference with sight, breathing,\\nand hearing.\\n\\nBony formations occur in _muscles and tendons_, especially at their\\npoints of attachment to the skeleton, and are known as false exostoses;\\nthey are described with the diseases of muscles.\\n\\n#Odontoma.#--An odontoma is composed of dental tissues in varying\\nproportions and different degrees of development, arising from\\ntooth-germs or from teeth still in process of growth (Bland Sutton).\\nOdontomas resemble teeth in so far that during their development they\\nremain hidden below the mucous membrane and give no evidence of their\\nexistence. There then succeeds, usually between the twentieth and\\ntwenty-fifth years, an eruptive stage, which is often attended with\\nsuppuration, and this may be the means of drawing attention to the\\ntumour. Following Bland Sutton, several varieties of odontoma may be\\ndistinguished according to the part of the tooth-germ concerned in their\\nformation.\\n\\nThe _epithelial odontoma_ is derived from persistent portions of the\\nepithelium of the enamel organ, and constitutes a multilocular cystic\\ntumour which is chiefly met with in the mandible. The cystic spaces of\\nthe tumour contain a brownish glairy fluid. These tumours have been\\ndescribed by Eve under the name of multilocular cystic epithelial\\ntumours of the jaw.\\n\\nThe _follicular odontoma_, also known as a _dentigerous cyst_, is\\nderived from the distension of a tooth follicle. It constitutes a cyst\\ncontaining a viscid fluid, and an imperfectly formed tooth is often\\nfound embedded in its wall. The cyst usually forms in relation to one of\\nthe permanent molars, and may attain considerable dimensions.\\n\\nThe _fibrous odontoma_ is the result of an overgrowth of fibrous tissue\\nsurrounding the tooth sac, which encapsulates the tooth and prevents its\\neruption. The thickened tooth sac is usually mistaken for a fibrous\\ntumour, until, after removal, the tooth is recognised in its interior.\\n\\n_Composite Odontoma._--This is a convenient term to apply to certain\\nhard dental tumours which are met with in the jaws, and consist of\\nenamel, dentine, and cement. The tumour is to be regarded as being\\nderived from an abnormal growth of all the elements of a tooth germ, or\\nof two or more tooth germs, indiscriminately fused with one another. It\\nmay appear in childhood, and form a smooth unyielding tumour, often of\\nconsiderable size, replacing the corresponding permanent tooth. It may\\ncause a purulent discharge, and in some cases it has been extruded after\\nsloughing of the overlying soft parts. Many examples of this variety of\\nodontoma, growing in the nasal cavity or in the maxillary sinus, have\\nbeen erroneously regarded as osteomas even after removal.\\n\\nOn section, the tumour is usually laminated, and is seen to consist\\nmainly of dentine with a partial covering of enamel and cement.\\n\\n_Diagnosis._--Odontomas are often only diagnosed after removal. When\\nattended with suppuration, the condition has been mistaken for disease\\nof the jaw. Fibrous odontomas have been mistaken for sarcoma, and\\nportions of the maxilla removed unnecessarily. Any circumscribed tumour\\nof the jaw, particularly when met with in a young adult, should suggest\\nthe possibility of an odontoma. Skiagrams often give useful information\\nboth for diagnosis and for treatment.\\n\\n_Treatment._--The solid varieties of odontoma can usually be shelled out\\nafter dividing the overlying soft parts. In the follicular variety, it\\nis usually sufficient to excise a portion of the wall, scrape out the\\ninterior, and remove any tooth that may be present. The cavity is then\\npacked and allowed to heal from the bottom.\\n\\n#Fibroma.#--A fibroma is a tumour composed of fibrous connective tissue.\\nA distinction may be made between the _soft fibroma_, which is\\ncomparatively rich in cells and blood vessels, and in which the fibres\\nare arranged loosely; and the _hard fibroma_, which is composed of\\nclosely packed bundles of fibres often arranged in a concentric fashion\\naround the blood vessels. The cut surface of the soft fibroma presents a\\npinkish-white, fleshy appearance, resembling the slowly growing forms of\\nsarcoma; that of a hard fibroma presents a dry, glistening appearance,\\naptly compared to watered silk. The soft variety grows much more rapidly\\nthan the hard. In certain fibromas--in those, for example, which grow\\nfrom the periosteum of the base of the skull and project into the\\nnaso-pharynx--the blood vessels are dilated into sinuses and have no\\nproper sheaths; they therefore tend to remain open when divided, and to\\nbleed excessively. Transition forms between soft fibroma and sarcoma are\\nmet with, so that in operating for their removal it is safer to take\\naway the capsule along with the tumour, and the patient should be kept\\nunder observation in view of the risk of recurrence.\\n\\nThe skin--especially the skin of the buttock--is one of the favourite\\nseats of fibroma, and it may occur in a multiple form. It is met with\\nalso in the subcutaneous and intermuscular cellular tissue, and in the\\nabdominal wall, where it sometimes attains considerable dimensions.\\nVarious forms of fibroma are met with in the mamma and are described\\nwith diseases of that organ. The fibrous overgrowths in the skin, known\\nas _keloid_ and _molluscum fibrosum_, and those met with in the _sheaths\\nof nerves_, are described elsewhere. Fibroid tumours of the uterus are\\ndescribed with myoma.\\n\\n_Diffuse fibroma_ or _Fibromatosis_, analogous to lipomatosis, is met\\nwith in the connective tissue of the skin and sheaths of nerves, and\\nconstitutes one form of neuro-fibromatosis; a similar change is also met\\nwith in the stomach and colon.\\n\\n#Myxoma.#--A myxoma is composed of tissue of a soft gelatinous,\\nsemifluid consistence. The pure myxoma is extremely rare, and\\nclinically resembles the lipoma. Myxomatous tissue is, however,\\nfrequently found in other connective-tissue tumours as a result of\\ndegeneration, for example, in cartilaginous tumours and in sarcomas.\\nMyxomatous tissue is also a prominent constituent of the \"innocent\\nparotid tumour.\" Mucous polypus of the nose, which is often described as\\na myxoma, is merely a pendulous process of oedematous mucous membrane.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--Myeloma of Shaft of Humerus, causing\\npathological fracture. (Mr. J. W. Struthers\\' case.)\\n\\n(The unusual site of the tumour is to be noted.)]\\n\\n#Myeloma.#--A myeloma is composed of large multinuclear giant cells\\nsurrounded by round and spindle cells. The cut surface of the tumour\\npresents a deep red or maroon colour. While occasionally met with in\\ntendon sheaths and bursae, and is then of an orange-yellow colour, the\\nmyeloma occurs most frequently in the cancellous tissue at the ends of\\nthe long bones, its favourite site being the upper end of the tibia.\\nAlthough formerly classified as a sarcoma, it is the exception for it to\\npresent malignant features, and it can usually be extirpated by local\\nmeasures without fear of recurrence. The diagnosis, X-ray appearances,\\nand the method of removal are considered with the diseases of bone.\\nSometimes the myeloma is met with in multiple form in the skeleton, in\\nassociation with an unusual form of protein in the urine (Bence Jones).\\n\\n#Myoma.#--A myoma is composed of non-striped muscle fibres. A pure myoma\\nis very rare, and is met with in organs possessed of non-striped muscle,\\nsuch as the stomach, intestine, urinary bladder, and prostate. In the\\nuterus, which is the most common situation, these tumours contain a\\nconsiderable admixture of fibrous tissue, and are known as _fibroids_ or\\n_fibro-myomas_. They present on section a fasciculated appearance, which\\nmay resemble that of a section of balls of cotton (Fig. 54). They are\\nencapsulated and vascular, frequently attain a large size, and may be\\nsingle or multiple. While they may occasion neither inconvenience nor\\nsuffering, they frequently give rise to profuse haemorrhage from the\\nuterus, and may cause serious symptoms by pressing injuriously on the\\nureters or the intestine, or by complicating pregnancy and parturition.\\n\\nThe #Rhabdomyoma# is an extremely rare form of tumour, met with in the\\nkidney, uterus, and testicle. It contains striped muscle fibres, and is\\nsupposed to originate from a residue of muscular tissue which has become\\nsequestrated during development.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Fibro-myoma of Uterus.\\n\\n(Anatomical Museum, University of Edinburgh.)]\\n\\n#Glioma.#--A glioma is a tumour composed of neuroglia. It is met with\\nexclusively in the central nervous system, retina, and optic nerve. It\\nis a slowly growing, soft, ill-defined tumour, which displaces the\\nadjacent nerve centres and nerve tracts, and is liable to become the\\nseat of haemorrhage and thus to give rise to pressure symptoms resembling\\napoplexy. The glioma of the retina tends to grow into the vitreous\\nhumour and to perforate the globe. It is usually of the nature of a\\nglio-sarcoma and is highly malignant.\\n\\n#Endotheliomas# take origin from the endothelium of lymph vessels and\\nblood vessels, and serous cavities. They show great variation in type,\\npartly because of the number of different kinds of endothelium from\\nwhich they are derived, and partly because the new connective tissue\\nwhich is formed is liable to undergo transformation into other tissues.\\nThey may be soft or hard, solid or cystic, diffuse or circumscribed;\\nthey grow very slowly, and are almost always innocent, although\\nrecurrence has been occasionally observed. Cases of multiple\\nendotheliomata of the skin have recently been described by Wise.\\n\\n_Angioma_, _lymphangioma_, and _neuroma_ are described with the disease\\nof the individual tissues.\\n\\n\\nMALIGNANT CONNECTIVE-TISSUE TUMOURS--SARCOMA\\n\\nThe term sarcoma is applied to any connective-tissue tumour which\\nexhibits malignant characters. The essential structural feature is the\\npredominance of the cellular elements over the intercellular substance\\nor stroma, in which respect a sarcoma resembles the connective tissue of\\nthe embryo. The typical sarcoma consists chiefly of immature or\\nembryonic connective tissue. It most frequently originates from fascia,\\nintermuscular connective tissue, periosteum, bone-marrow, and skin, and\\nforms a rounded or nodulated tumour which appears to be encapsulated,\\nbut the capsule merely consists of the condensed surrounding tissues,\\nand usually contains sarcomatous elements. The consistence of the tumour\\ndepends on the nature and amount of the stroma, and on the presence of\\ndegenerative changes. The softer medullary forms are composed almost\\nexclusively of cells; while the harder forms--such as the fibro-,\\nchondro-, and osteo-sarcoma--are provided with an abundant stroma and\\nare relatively poor in cells. Degenerative changes may produce areas of\\nsoftening or liquefaction which result in the formation of cystic\\ncavities in the interior of the tumour. The colour depends on the amount\\nof blood in the tumour, and on the presence of the products of\\ndegeneration.\\n\\nThe blood vessels are usually represented by mere chinks or spaces\\nbetween the cells. This peculiarity accounts for the facility with which\\nhaemorrhage takes place into the substance of the tumour, the persistence\\nof the bleeding when it is incised or ulcerates through the skin, and\\nthe readiness with which the sarcomatous cells are carried off and\\ninfect distant parts through the blood-stream. Sarcomas are devoid of\\nlymphatics, and unless originating in lymphatic structures--for example,\\nin the tonsil--they rarely infect the lymph glands. Minute portions of\\nthe tumour grow into the small veins, and, becoming detached, are\\ntransported by the blood-current to distant organs, where they are\\narrested in the capillaries and give rise to secondary growths. These\\nare most frequently situated in the lungs, except when the primary\\ngrowth lies within the territory of the portal circulation, in which\\ncase they occur in the liver. The secondary growths closely resemble the\\nparent tumour. Sarcoma may invade an adjacent vein on such a scale that\\nif the invading portion becomes detached it may constitute a dangerous\\nembolus. This may be observed in sarcoma of the kidney, the growth\\ntaking place along the renal vein until it projects into the vena cava.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Recurrent Sarcoma of Sciatic Nerve in a woman\\naet. 27. Recurrence twenty months after removal of primary growth.]\\n\\nIn its growth, a sarcoma compresses and destroys neighbouring parts,\\nsurrounds vessels and nerves, and may lead to destruction of the skin,\\neither by invading it, or more commonly by causing sloughing from\\npressure. Inflammatory and suppurative changes may take place as a\\nresult of pyogenic infection following upon sloughing of the overlying\\nskin or upon an exploratory incision. Once the skin is broken the tumour\\nfungates through the opening. Sarcomas vary in malignancy, especially as\\nregards rapidity of growth and capacity for dissemination. Certain of\\nthem, such as the so-called \"recurrent fibroid of Paget,\" grow\\ncomparatively slowly, and are only malignant in the sense that they tend\\nto recur locally after removal; others--especially the more cellular\\nones--grow with extreme rapidity, and are early disseminated throughout\\nthe body, resembling in these respects the most malignant forms of\\ncancer. They are usually solitary in the first instance, although\\nprimary multiple growths are occasionally met with in the skin and in\\nthe bones.\\n\\nMany varieties of sarcoma are recognised, according to its structural\\npeculiarities. Thus, in virtue of the size and character of the cells,\\nwe have the _small round-celled_ and the _large round-celled_ sarcoma,\\nthe _small_ and the _large spindle-celled_, the _giant-celled_ and the\\n_mixed-celled_ sarcoma. The _lympho-sarcoma_ presents a structure\\nsimilar to that of lymph-follicular tissue, and the _alveolar sarcoma_\\nan arrangement of cells in alveoli resembling that seen in cancers. When\\nthere is a considerable amount of intercellular fibrous tissue, the\\ntumour is called a _fibro-sarcoma_.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Fungating Sarcoma of Arm.\\n\\n(Dr. J. M\\'Watt\\'s case.)]\\n\\nThe term _lymphangio-sarcoma_ is applied when the cells of the tumour\\nare derived from the endothelium of lymph spaces and vessels. The\\n_angio-sarcomas_ are those in which blood vessels form a prominent\\nelement in the structure of the tumour. They are sometimes derived from\\ninnocent angiomas, and they may be so vascular as to pulsate and on\\nauscultation yield a blowing murmur like an aneurysm. The\\n_glio-sarcoma_, _myxo-sarcoma_, _chondro-sarcoma_, and _myo-sarcoma_ are\\nmixed forms which usually develop in pre-existing innocent tumours. The\\n_osteo-sarcoma_ is characterised by the formation in the tumour of bone,\\nthe medullary spaces being occupied by sarcomatous cells in place of\\nmarrow. The _osteoid sarcoma_ is characterised by the formation of a\\ntissue resembling bone but deficient in lime salts, and the _petrifying\\nsarcoma_ by the formation of calcified areas in the stroma. These\\nvarieties, although met with chiefly in the bones, may occur in soft\\ntissues such as muscle, and in such organs as the mamma. The pigmented\\nvarieties include the _chloroma_, which is of a light-green colour, and\\nthe _melanotic sarcoma_, which is brown or black. The _psammoma_ is a\\nsarcoma containing a material resembling sand; it is chiefly met with in\\nthe membranes of the brain. The _chordoma_ is a rare form of tumour\\noriginating from the remains of the notochord in the region of the\\nspheno-occipital synchondrosis or in the sacro-coccygeal region.\\n\\n_Diagnosis of Sarcoma._--A sarcoma is to be differentiated from an\\ninflammatory swelling such as results from tubercle, actinomycosis, or\\nsyphilis, from an innocent tumour, and from a cancer. The points on\\nwhich the diagnosis is founded are discussed with the different tissues\\nand organs.\\n\\n_Treatment._--The removal of the tumour by operation is the most\\nreliable method of treatment; in order to be successful it must be\\nundertaken before dissemination has taken place, and a considerable area\\nof healthy tissue beyond the apparent margin of the growth must be\\nremoved, and in tumours near the surface of the body, the overlying skin\\nalso.\\n\\nIn order to prevent recurrence, a tube of _radium_, to which a silk\\nthread is attached, is inserted into the space from which the tumour was\\nremoved; the thread is brought out at the drain-opening, and at the end\\nof a week or ten days the tube of radium is removed by pulling on the\\nthread. Radium causes a reaction in the tissues attended with exudation\\nfrom the vessels, for the escape of which provision must be made. If\\nradium is not available, the affected area is repeatedly exposed to the\\naction of the _X-rays_ as soon as the wound has healed. The employment\\nof these measures has diminished to a remarkable degree the recurrence\\nof sarcoma after operation.\\n\\nIt will readily be understood that the less thoroughly or radically the\\ngrowth has been removed, the more do we depend upon radium or the X-rays\\nfor bringing about a permanent cure, and that in advanced cases of\\nsarcoma and in cases in which, on account of their anatomical situation,\\nremoval by operation is necessarily incomplete, the prospect of cure is\\nstill more dependent on the use of radium or of the X-rays. Finally,\\nthere are cases in which removal by operation is impossible, the\\nso-called _inoperable sarcoma_; a tube of radium, to which a silk thread\\nis attached, is inserted into the substance of the tumour, either\\nthrough an opening made by a large trocar, or, when necessary, by open\\ndissection. A second tube of radium is placed upon the skin over the\\ntumour and is secured there by a stitch or by a strip of plaster, thus\\nsecuring a cross-fire action of the radium rays, both from within and\\nwithout, as this is found to be much more efficacious in destroying or\\ninhibiting the cellular elements of the growth. The tubes of radium are\\nleft _in situ_ for from eight to fourteen days, according to the power\\nof the radium employed, but are moved about every second day or so in\\norder that every part of the tumour may be efficiently radiated. If the\\ntumour shrinks in size after the use of radium and becomes operable, it\\nshould be removed before time is given it to resume its growth. It will\\ndepend upon the subsequent course of the disease, whether or not a\\nsecond, or it may be even a third, application of radium will be\\nrequired.\\n\\nWhere neither radium nor X-rays is available or applicable, recourse may\\nbe had to the injection of Coley\\'s fluid, a preparation containing the\\nmixed toxins of the streptococcus of erysipelas and the bacillus\\nprodigiosus; or of selenium.\\n\\n\\nEPITHELIAL TUMOURS\\n\\nAn excessive and erratic growth of epithelium is the essential and\\ndistinguishing feature of these tumours. The innocent forms are the\\npapilloma and the adenoma; the malignant, the carcinoma or cancer.\\n\\n#Papilloma.#--A papilloma is a tumour which projects from a cutaneous or\\nmucous surface, and consists of a central axis of vascular fibrous\\ntissue with a covering of epithelium resembling that of the surface from\\nwhich the tumour grows. In the papillomas of the skin--commonly known as\\n_warts_--the covering consists of epidermis; in those growing from\\nmucous surfaces it consists of the epithelium covering the mucous\\nmembrane. When the surface epithelium projects as filiform processes,\\nthe tumour is called a _villous papilloma_, the best-known example of\\nwhich is met with in the urinary bladder. Papillomatous growths are\\nalso met with in the larynx, in the ducts of the breast, and in the\\ninterior of certain cystic tumours of the breast and of the ovary.\\nAlthough papillomas are primarily innocent, they may become the\\nstarting-point of cancer, especially in persons past middle life and if\\nthe papilloma has been subjected to irritation and has ulcerated. The\\nclinical features and treatment of the various forms of papilloma are\\nconsidered with the individual tissues and organs.\\n\\n#Adenoma.#--An adenoma is a tumour constructed on the type of, and\\ngrowing in connection with, a secreting gland. In the substance of such\\nglands as the mamma, parotid, thyreoid, and prostate, adenomas are met\\nwith as encapsulated tumours. When they originate from the glands of the\\nskin or of a mucous membrane, they tend to project from the surface, and\\nform pedunculated tumours or polypi.\\n\\nAdenomas may be single or multiple, and they vary greatly in size. The\\ntumour is seldom composed entirely of gland tissue; it usually contains\\na considerable proportion of fibrous tissue, and is then called a\\n_fibro-adenoma_. When it contains myxomatous tissue it is called a\\n_myxo-adenoma_, and when the gland spaces of the tumour become distended\\nwith accumulated secretion, a _cystic adenoma_, the best examples of\\nwhich are met with in the mamma and ovary. A characteristic feature of\\nthe cystic variety is the tendency the tumour tissue exhibits to project\\ninto the interior of the cysts, constituting what are known as\\n_intracystic growths_. They are essentially innocent, but intracystic\\ngrowths, especially in the mamma of women over fifty, should be regarded\\nwith suspicion and therefore should be removed on radical lines.\\nTransition forms between adenoma and carcinoma are also met with in the\\nrectum and large intestine, and these should be treated on the same\\nlines as cancer.\\n\\n\\nCARCINOMA OR CANCER\\n\\nA cancer is a malignant tumour which originates in epithelium. The\\ncancer cells are derived by proliferation from already existing\\nepithelium, and they invade the sub-epithelial connective tissue in the\\nform of simple or branching columns. These columns are enclosed in\\nspaces--termed alveoli--which are probably dilated lymph spaces, and\\nwhich communicate freely with the lymph vessels. The cells composing the\\ncolumns and filling the alveoli vary with the character of the\\nepithelium in which the cancer originates. The malignancy of cancer\\ndepends on the tendency which the epithelium has of invading the tissues\\nin its neighbourhood, and on the capacity of the cells, when\\ntransported elsewhere by the lymph or blood-stream, of giving rise to\\nsecondary growths.\\n\\nCancer may arise on any surface covered by epithelium or in any of the\\nsecreting glands of the body, but it is much more common in some\\nsituations than in others. It is frequently met with, for example, in\\nthe skin, in the stomach and large intestine, in the breast, the uterus,\\nand the external genitals; less frequently in the gall-bladder, larynx,\\nthyreoid, prostate, and urinary bladder.\\n\\nTissues appear to be most liable to cancer when, having attained\\nmaturity, they enter upon the phase of decadence or involution, and this\\nphase is reached by different tissues at different periods. It is not so\\nmuch, therefore, the age of the person in whom it occurs, as the age of\\nthe tissue in which it arises, that determines the maximum incidence of\\ncancer. Cancer of the stomach appears and attains a maximum frequency\\nearlier than cancer of the skin; cancer of the uterus and mamma is more\\nfrequent towards the decline of reproductive activity than in the later\\nyears of life; rectal cancer is not infrequently met with during the\\nsecond and third decades. There is evidence that the irritation caused\\nby alcohol and tobacco plays a part in the causation of cancer, in the\\nfact that a large proportion of those who become the subjects of cancer\\nof the mouth are excessive drinkers and smokers.\\n\\nA cancer may appear as a papillary growth on a mucous or a skin surface,\\nas a nodule in the substance of an organ, or as a diffuse thickening of\\na tubular organ such as the stomach or intestine. The absence of\\ndefinition in cancerous tumours explains the difficulty of completely\\nremoving them by surgical measures, and has led to the practice of\\ncomplete extirpation of cancerous organs wherever this is possible. The\\nboundaries of the affected organ, moreover, are frequently transgressed\\nby the disease, and the epithelial infiltration implicates the\\nsurrounding parts. In cancer of the breast, for example, the disease\\noften extends to the adjacent skin, fat, and muscle; in cancer of the\\nlip or tongue, to the mandible; in cancer of the uterus or intestine, to\\nthe investing peritoneum.\\n\\nIn addition to its tendency to infiltrate adjacent tissues and organs,\\ncancer is also liable to give rise to _secondary growths_. These are\\nmost often met with in the nearest lymph glands; those in the neck, for\\nexample, becoming infected from cancer of the lip, tongue, or throat;\\nthose in the axilla, from cancer of the breast; those along the\\ncurvatures of the stomach, from cancer of the pylorus; and those in the\\ngroin, from cancer of the external genitals. In lymph vessels the cancer\\ncells may merely accumulate so as to fill the lumen and form indurated\\ncords, or they may proliferate and give rise to secondary nodules along\\nthe course of the vessels. When the lymphatic network in the skin is\\ndiffusely infected, the appearance is either that of a multitude of\\nsecondary nodules or of a diffuse thickening, so that the skin comes to\\nresemble coarse leather. On the wall of the chest this condition is\\nknown as _cancer en cuirasse_. Although the cancer cells constantly\\nattack the walls of the adjacent veins and spread into their interior at\\na comparatively early period, secondary growths due to dissemination by\\nthe blood-stream rarely show themselves clinically until late in the\\ncourse of the disease. It is probable that many of the cancer cells\\nwhich are carried away in the blood or lymph stream undergo necrosis and\\nfail to give rise to secondary growths. Secondary growths present a\\nfaithful reproduction of the structure of the primary tumour. Apart from\\nthe lymph glands, the chief seats of secondary growths are the liver,\\nlungs, serous membranes, and bone marrow.\\n\\nIt is generally believed that the secondary growths in cancer that\\ndevelop at a distance from the primary tumour, those, for example, in\\nthe medullary canal of the femur or in the diploe of the skull occurring\\nin advanced cases of cancer of the breast, are the result of\\ndissemination of cancer cells by way of the blood-stream and are to be\\nregarded as emboli. Sampson Handley disagrees with this view; he\\nbelieves that the dissemination is accomplished in a more subtle way,\\nnamely, by the actual growth of cancer cells along the finer vessels of\\nthe lymph plexuses that ramify in the deep fascia, a method of spread\\nwhich he calls _permeation_. It is maintained also that permeation\\noccurs as readily against the lymph stream as with it. He compares the\\nspread of cancer to that of an invisible annular ringworm. The growing\\nedge extends in a wider and wider circle, within which a healing process\\nmay occur, so that the area of permeation is a ring, rather than a disc.\\nHealing occurs by a process of \"peri-lymphatic fibrosis,\" but as the\\nnatural process of healing may fail at isolated points, nodules of\\ncancer appear, which, although apparently separate from the primary\\ngrowth, have developed in continuity with it, peri-lymphatic fibrosis\\nhaving destroyed the cancer chain connecting the nodule with the primary\\ngrowth. This centrifugal spread of cancer is clearly seen in the\\ndistribution of the subcutaneous secondary nodules so frequently met\\nwith in the late stages of mammary cancer. The area within which the\\nsecondary nodules occur is a circle of continually increasing diameter\\nwith the primary growth in the centre.\\n\\nIn the rare cases in which the skin of the greater part of the body is\\naffected, the nodules rarely appear below the level of the deltoid or\\nthe middle third of the thigh, the patient dying before the spread can\\nreach the distal portions of the limbs.\\n\\nHandley argues against the embolic origin of the metastases in the bones\\nbecause of the rarity of these in the bones of the distal parts of the\\nlimbs, because of the fact that secondary cancer of the femur nearly\\nalways commences in the upper third of the shaft, which harmonises with\\nthe intimate connection of the deep fascia with the periosteum over the\\ngreat trochanter, thus favouring invasion of the bone marrow when\\npermeation has spread thus far. He claims support for the permeation\\ntheory from the fact that the humerus is rarely involved below the\\ninsertion of the deltoid, and that spontaneous fracture of the femur is\\nthree times more common on the side on which the breast cancer is\\nsituated.\\n\\nThe tumour tissue may undergo necrosis, and when the overlying skin or\\nmucous membrane gives way an ulcer is formed. The margins of a\\n_cancerous ulcer_ (Fig. 57) are made up of tumour tissue which has not\\nbroken down. Usually they are irregular, nodularly thickened or\\nindurated; sometimes they are raised and crater-like. The floor of the\\nulcer is smooth and glazed, or occupied by necrosed tissue, and the\\ndischarge is watery and blood-stained, and as a result of putrefactive\\nchanges may become offensive. Haemorrhage is rarely a prominent feature,\\nbut discharge of blood may constitute a symptom of considerable\\ndiagnostic importance in cancer of internal organs such as the rectum,\\nthe bladder, or the uterus.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Carcinoma of Breast with Cancerous Ulcer.]\\n\\n_The Contagiousness of Cancer._--A limited number of cases are on record\\nin which a cancer appears to have been transferred by contact, as from\\nthe lower to the upper lip, from one labium majus to the other, from the\\ntongue to the cheek, and from one vocal cord to the other; these being\\nall examples of cancer involving surfaces which are constantly or\\nfrequently in contact. The transference of cancer from one human being\\nto another, whether by accident, as in the case of a surgeon wounding\\nhis finger while operating for cancer, or by the deliberate introduction\\nof a portion of cancerous tumour into the tissues, has never been known\\nto occur. It is by no means infrequent, however, that when recurrence\\ntakes place after an operation for the removal of cancer, the recurrent\\nnodules make their appearance in the main scar or in the scars of\\nstitches in its neighbourhood. In the lower animals the grafting of\\ncancer only succeeds in animals of the same species; for example, a\\ncancer taken from a mouse will not grow in the tissues of a rat, but\\nonly in a mouse of the same variety as that from which the graft was\\ntaken.\\n\\nWhile cancer cannot be regarded as either contagious or infectious, it\\nis important to bear in mind the possibility of infection of a wound\\nwith cancer when operating for the disease. A cancer should not be cut\\ninto unless this is essential for purposes of diagnosis, and the wound\\nmade for exploration should be tightly closed by stitches before the\\ncurative operation is proceeded with; the instruments used for the\\nexploration must not be used again until they have been boiled. The\\ngreatest care should be taken that a cancer which has softened or broken\\ndown is not opened into during the operation.\\n\\nInvestigations regarding the cause of cancer have been prosecuted with\\ngreat energy during recent years, but as yet without positive result. It\\nis recognised that there are a number of conditions which favour the\\ndevelopment of cancer, such as prolonged irritation, and a considerable\\nnumber of cases have been recorded in which cancer of the skin of the\\nhands has followed prolonged and repeated exposure to the Rontgen rays.\\n\\n_The Alleged Increase of Cancer._--Regarding the alleged increase of\\ncancer, it may be pointed out that it is impossible to ascertain how\\nmuch of the apparent increase is due to more accurate diagnosis and\\nimproved registration. It is probable also that some increase has taken\\nplace in consequence of the increased average duration of life; a larger\\nproportion of persons now reach the age at which cancer is frequent.\\n\\n_The prognosis_ largely depends on the variety of cancer and on its\\nsituation. Certain varieties--such as the atrophic cancer of the breast\\nwhich occurs in old people, and some forms of cancer in the rectum--are\\nso indolent in their progress that they can scarcely be said to shorten\\nlife; while others--such as the softer varieties of mammary cancer\\noccurring in young women--are among the most malignant of tumours. The\\nmode in which cancer causes death depends to a large extent upon its\\nsituation. In the gullet, for example, it usually causes death by\\nstarvation; in the larynx or thyreoid, by suffocation; in the intestine,\\nby obstruction of the bowels; in the uterus, prostate, and bladder, by\\nhaemorrhage or by implication of the ureters and kidneys. Independently\\nof their situation, however, cancers frequently cause death by giving\\nrise to a progressive impairment of health known as the _cancerous\\ncachexia_, a condition which is due to the continued absorption of\\npoisonous products from the tumour. The patient loses appetite, becomes\\nemaciated, pale, and feverish, and gradually loses strength until he\\ndies. In many cases, especially those in which ulceration has occurred,\\nthe addition of pyogenic infection may also be concerned in the failure\\nof health.\\n\\n_Treatment._--Removal by surgical means affords the best prospect of\\ncure. If carcinomatous disease is to be rooted out, its mode of spread\\nby means of the lymph vessels must be borne in mind, and as this occurs\\nat an early stage, and is not evident on examination, a wide area must\\nbe included in the operation. The organ from which the original growth\\nsprings should, if practicable, be altogether removed, because its lymph\\nvessels generally communicate freely with each other, and secondary\\ndeposits have probably already taken place in various parts of it. In\\naddition, the nearest chain of lymph glands must also be removed, even\\nthough they may not be noticeably enlarged, and in some cases--in cancer\\nof the breast, for example--the intervening lymph vessels should be\\nremoved at the same time.\\n\\nThe treatment of cancer by other than operative methods has received a\\ngreat deal of attention within recent years, and many agents have been\\nput to the test, _e.g._ colloidal suspensions of selenium, but without\\nany positive results. Most benefit has resulted from the use of radium\\nand of the X-rays, and one or other should be employed as a routine\\nmeasure after every operation for cancer.\\n\\nIt has been demonstrated that cancer cells are more sensitive to radium\\nand to the Rontgen rays than the normal cells of the body, and are more\\neasily killed. The effect varies a good deal with the nature and seat of\\nthe tumour. In rodent cancers of the skin, for example, both radium and\\nX-ray treatment are very successful, and are to be preferred to\\noperation because they yield a better cosmetic result. While small\\nepitheliomas of the skin may be cured by means of the rays, they are not\\nso amenable as rodent cancers.\\n\\nCancers of mucous membranes are less amenable to ray treatment because\\nthey are less circumscribed and are difficult of access. In cancers\\nunder the skin, the Rontgen rays are less efficient; if radium is\\nemployed, the tube containing it should be inserted into the substance\\nof the tumour after the method described in connection with sarcoma--and\\nanother tube should be placed on the overlying skin.\\n\\nIn the employment of X-rays and of radium in the treatment of cancer,\\nexperience is required, not only to obtain the maximum effect of the\\nrays, but to avoid damage to the adjacent and overlying tissues.\\n\\nRay treatment is not to be looked upon as a rival but as a powerful\\nsupplement to the operative treatment of cancer.\\n\\n\\nVARIETIES OF CANCER\\n\\nThe varieties of cancer are distinguished according to the character and\\narrangement of the epithelial cells.\\n\\nThe _squamous epithelial cancer_ or _epithelioma_ originates from a\\nsurface covered by squamous epithelium, such as the skin, or the mucous\\nmembrane of the mouth, gullet, or larynx. The cancer cells retain the\\ncharacters of squamous epithelium, and, being confined within the lymph\\nspaces of the sub-epithelial connective tissue, become compressed and\\nundergo a horny change. This results in the formation of concentrically\\nlaminated masses known as cell nests.\\n\\nThe clinical features are those of a slowly growing indurated tumour,\\nwhich nearly always ulcerates; there is a characteristic induration of\\nthe edges and floor of the ulcer, and its surface is often covered with\\nwarty or cauliflower-like outgrowths (Fig. 58). The infection of the\\nlymph glands is early and constant, and constitutes the most dangerous\\nfeature of the disease; the secondary growths in the glands exhibit the\\ncharacteristic induration, and may themselves break down and lead to the\\nformation of ulcers.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Epithelioma of Lip.]\\n\\nEpithelioma frequently originates in long-standing ulcers or sinuses,\\nand in scars, and probably results from the displacement and\\nsequestration of epithelial cells during the process of cicatrisation.\\n\\nThe _columnar epithelial cancer_ or _columnar epithelioma_ originates in\\nmucous membranes covered with columnar epithelium, and is chiefly met\\nwith in the stomach and intestine. As it resembles an adenoma in\\nstructure it is sometimes described as a _malignant adenoma_. Its\\nmalignancy is shown by the proliferating epithelium invading the other\\ncoats of the stomach or intestine, and by the development of secondary\\ngrowths.\\n\\n_Glandular carcinoma_ originates in organs such as the breast, and in\\nthe glands of mucous membranes and skin. The epithelial cells are not\\narranged on any definite plan, but are closely packed in irregularly\\nshaped alveoli. If the alveoli are large and the intervening stroma is\\nscanty and delicate, the tumour is soft and brain-like, and is described\\nas a _medullary_ or _encephaloid cancer_. If the alveoli are small and\\nthe intervening stroma is abundant and composed of dense fibrous tissue,\\nthe tumour is hard, and is known as a _scirrhous cancer_--a form which\\nis most frequently met with in the breast. If the cells undergo\\ndegeneration and absorption and the stroma contracts, the tumour becomes\\nstill harder, and tends to shrink and to draw in the surrounding parts,\\nleading, in the breast, to retraction of the nipple and overlying skin,\\nand in the stomach and colon to narrowing of the lumen. When the cells\\nof the tumour undergo colloid degeneration, a _colloid cancer_ results;\\nif the degeneration is complete, as may occur in the breast, the\\nmalignancy is thereby greatly diminished; if only partial, as is more\\ncommon in rectal cancer, the malignancy is not appreciably affected.\\nMelanin pigment is formed in relation to the cells and stroma of certain\\nepithelial tumours, giving rise to _melanotic cancer_, one of the most\\nmalignant of all new growths. Cyst-like spaces may form in the tumour by\\nthe accumulation of the secretion of the epithelial cells, or as a\\nresult of their degeneration--_cystic carcinoma_. This is met with\\nchiefly in the breast and ovary, and the tumour resembles the cystic\\nadenoma, but it tends to infect its surroundings and gives rise to\\nsecondary growths.\\n\\n_Rodent cancer_ originates in the glands of the skin, and presents a\\nspecial tendency to break down and ulcerate on the surface (Figs. 102\\nand 103). It almost never infects the lymph glands.\\n\\n\\nDERMOIDS\\n\\nA dermoid is a tumour containing skin or mucous membrane, occurring in a\\nsituation where these tissues are not met under normal conditions.\\n\\nThe _skin dermoid_, or _derma-cyst_ as it has been called by Askanazy,\\narises from a portion of epiblast, which has become sequestrated during\\nthe process of coalescence of two cutaneous surfaces in development.\\nThis form is therefore most frequently met with on the face and neck in\\nthe situations which correspond to the various clefts and fissures of\\nthe embryo. It occurs also on the trunk in situations where the lateral\\nhalves of the body coalesce during development. Such a dermoid usually\\ntakes the form of a globular cyst, the wall of which consists of skin,\\nand the contents of turbid fluid containing desquamated epithelium, fat\\ndroplets, cholestrol crystals, and detached hairs. Delicate hairs may\\nalso be found projecting from the epithelial lining of the cyst.\\n\\nFaulty coalescence of the cutaneous covering of the back occurs most\\nfrequently over the lower sacral vertebrae, giving rise to small\\ncongenital recesses, known as post-anal dimples and coccygeal sinuses.\\nThese recesses are lined with skin, which is furnished with hairs,\\nsebaceous and sweat glands. If the external orifice becomes occluded,\\nthere results a dermoid cyst.\\n\\n_Tubulo-dermoids_ arise from embryonic ducts and passages that are\\nnormally obliterated at birth, for example, _lingual dermoids_ develop\\nin relation to the thyreo-glossal duct; _rectal and post-rectal_\\ndermoids to the post-anal gut; and _branchial dermoids_ in relation to\\nthe branchial clefts. Tubulo-dermoids present the same structure as skin\\ndermoids, save that mucous membrane takes the place of skin in the wall\\nof the cyst, and the contents consist of the pent-up secretion of mucous\\nglands.\\n\\n_Clinical Features._--Although dermoids are of congenital origin, they\\nare rarely evident at birth, and may not give rise to visible tumours\\nuntil puberty, when the skin and its appendages become more active, or\\nnot till adult life. Superficial dermoids, such as those met with at the\\nouter angle of the orbit, form rounded, definitely limited tumours over\\nwhich the skin is freely movable. They are usually adherent to the\\ndeeper parts, and when situated over the skull may be lodged in a\\ndepression or actual gap in the bone. Sometimes the cyst becomes\\ninfected and suppurates, and finally ruptures on the surface. This may\\nlead to a natural cure, or a persistent sinus may form. Dermoids more\\ndeeply placed, such as those within the thorax, or those situated\\nbetween the rectum and sacrum, give rise to difficulty in diagnosis,\\neven with the help of the X-rays, and their nature is seldom recognised\\nuntil the escape of the contents--particularly hairs--supplies the clue.\\nThe literature of dermoid cysts is full of accounts of puzzling tumours\\nmet with in all sorts of situations.\\n\\nThe treatment is to remove the cyst. When it is impossible to remove the\\nwhole of the lining membrane by dissection, the portion that is left\\nshould be destroyed with the cautery.\\n\\n_Ovarian Dermoids._--Dermoids are not uncommon in the ovary (Fig. 59).\\nThey usually take the form of unilocular or multilocular cysts, the\\nwall of which contains skin, mucous membrane, hair follicles, sebaceous,\\nsweat, and mucous glands, nails, teeth, nipples, and mammary glands. The\\ncavity of the cyst usually contains a pultaceous mixture of shed\\nepithelium, fluid fat, and hair. If the cyst ruptures, the epithelial\\nelements are diffused over the peritoneum, and may give rise to\\nsecondary dermoids.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Dermoid Cyst of Ovary showing Teeth in its\\ninterior.]\\n\\nThe ovarian dermoid appears clinically as an abdominal or pelvic tumour\\nprovided with a pedicle; if the pedicle becomes twisted, the tumour\\nundergoes strangulation, an event which is attended with urgent\\nsymptoms, not unlike those of strangulated hernia.\\n\\nThe treatment consists in removing the tumour by laparotomy.\\n\\n#Teratoma.#--A teratoma is believed to result from partial dichotomy or\\ncleavage of the trunk axis of the embryo, and is found exclusively in\\nconnection with the skull and vertebral column. It may take the form of\\na monstrosity such as conjoined twins or a parasitic foetus, but more\\ncommonly it is met with as an irregularly shaped tumour, usually growing\\nfrom the sacrum. On dissection, such a tumour is found to contain a\\ncurious mixture of tissues--bones, skin, and portions of viscera, such\\nas the intestine or liver. The question of the removal of the tumour\\nrequires to be considered in relation to the conditions present in each\\nindividual case.\\n\\n\\nCYSTS[3]\\n\\n[3] Cysts which form in relation to new-growths have been considered\\nwith tumours.\\n\\nCysts are rounded sacs, the wall being composed of fibrous tissue lined\\nby epithelium or endothelium; the contents are fluid or semi-solid, and\\nvary in character according to the tissue in which the cyst has\\noriginated.\\n\\n_Retention and Exudation Cysts._--_Retention cysts_ develop when the\\nduct of a secreting gland is partly obstructed; the secretion\\naccumulates, and the gland and its duct become distended into a cyst.\\nThey are met with in the mamma and in the salivary glands. Sebaceous\\ncysts or wens are described with diseases of the skin. _Exudation cysts_\\narise from the distension of cavities which are not provided with\\nexcretory ducts, such as those in the thyreoid.\\n\\n_Implantation cysts_ are caused by the accidental transference of\\nportions of the epidermis into the underlying connective tissue, as may\\noccur in wounds by needles, awls, forks, or thorns. The implanted\\nepidermis proliferates and forms a small cyst. They are met with chiefly\\non the palmar aspect of the fingers, and vary in size from a split pea\\nto a cherry. The treatment consists in removing them by dissection.\\n\\n_Parasitic cysts_ are produced by the growth within the tissues of\\ncyst-forming parasites, the best known being the taenia echinococcus,\\nwhich gives rise to the _hydatid cyst_. The liver is by far the most\\ncommon site of hydatid cysts in the human subject.\\n\\nWith regard to the further life-history of hydatids, the living elements\\nof the cyst may die and degenerate, or the cyst may increase in size\\nuntil it ruptures. As a result of pyogenic infection the cyst may be\\nconverted into an abscess.\\n\\nThe _clinical features_ of hydatids vary so much with their situation\\nand size, that they are best discussed with the individual organs. In\\ngeneral it may be said that there is a slow formation of a globular,\\nelastic, fluctuating, painless swelling. Fluctuation is detected when\\nthe cyst approaches the surface, and it is then also that percussion\\nmay elicit the \"hydatid thrill\" or fremitus. This thrill is not often\\nobtainable, and in any case is not pathognomonic of hydatids, as it may\\nbe elicited in ascites and in other abdominal cysts. Pressure of the\\ncyst upon adjacent structures, and the occurrence of suppuration, are\\nattended with characteristic clinical features.\\n\\nThe _diagnosis_ of hydatids will be considered with the individual\\norgans. The disease is more common in certain parts of Australia and in\\nShetland and Iceland than in countries where the association of dogs in\\nthe domestic life of the inhabitants is less intimate. Pfeiler, who has\\nworked at the _serum diagnosis of hydatid disease_, regards the\\ncomplement deviation method as the most reliable; he believes that a\\npositive reaction may almost be regarded as absolutely diagnostic of an\\nechinococcal lesion.\\n\\nThe _treatment_ is to excise the cyst completely, or to inject into it a\\n1 per cent. solution of formalin. In operating upon hydatids the utmost\\ncare must be taken to avoid leakage of the contents of the cyst, as\\nthese may readily disseminate the infection.\\n\\nA _blood cyst_ or haematoma results from the encapsulation of\\nextravasated blood in the tissues, from haemorrhage taking place into a\\npreformed cyst, or from the saccular pouching of a varicose vein.\\n\\nA _lymph cyst_ usually results from a contusion in which the skin is\\nforcibly displaced from the subjacent tissues, and lymph vessels are\\nthereby torn across. The cyst is usually situated between the skin and\\nfascia, and contains clear or blood-stained serum. At first it is lax\\nand fluctuates readily, later it becomes larger and more tense. The\\ntreatment consists in drawing off the contents through a hollow needle\\nand applying firm pressure. Apart from injury, lymph cysts are met with\\nas the result of the distension of lymph spaces and vessels\\n(_lymphangiectasis_); and in lymphangiomas, of which the best-known\\nexample is the cystic hygroma or hydrocele of the neck.\\n\\n\\nGANGLION\\n\\nThis term is applied to a cyst filled with a clear colourless jelly or\\ncolloid material, met with in the vicinity of a joint or tendon sheath.\\n\\nThe commonest variety--the _carpal ganglion_--popularly known as a\\nsprained sinew--is met with as a smooth, rounded, or oval swelling on\\nthe dorsal aspect of the carpus, usually towards its radial side (Fig. 60).\\nIt is situated over one of the intercarpal or other joints in this\\nregion, and may be connected with one or other of the extensor tendons.\\nThe skin and fascia are movable over the cyst. The cyst varies in size\\nfrom a pea to a pigeon\\'s egg, and usually attains its maximum size\\nwithin a few months and then remains stationary. It becomes tense and\\nprominent when the hand is flexed towards the palm. Its appearance is\\nusually ascribed to some strain of the wrist--for example, in girls\\nlearning gymnastics. It may cause no symptoms or it may interfere with\\nthe use of the hand, especially in grasping movements and when the hand\\nis dorsiflexed. In girls it may give rise to pain which shoots up the\\narm. Ganglia are also met with on the dorsum of the metacarpus and on\\nthe palmar aspect of the wrist.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Carpal Ganglion in a woman aet. 25.]\\n\\nThe _tarsal ganglion_ is situated on the dorsum of the foot over one or\\nother of the intertarsal joints. It is usually smaller, flatter, and\\nmore tense than that met with over the wrist, so that it is sometimes\\nmistaken for a bony tumour. It rarely causes symptoms, unless so\\nsituated as to be pressed upon by the boot.\\n\\n_Ganglia in the region of the knee_ are usually situated over the\\ninterval between the femur and tibia, most often on the lateral aspect\\nof the joint in front of the tendon of the biceps (Fig. 61). The\\nswelling, which may attain the size of half a walnut, is tense and hard\\nwhen the knee is extended, and becomes softer and more prominent when it\\nis flexed. They are met with in young adults who follow laborious\\noccupations or who indulge in athletics, and they cause stiffness,\\ndiscomfort, and impairment of the use of the limb. A ganglion is\\nsometimes met with on the median aspect of the head of the metatarsal\\nbone of the great toe and may be the cause of considerable suffering; it\\nis indistinguishable from the thickened and enlarged bursa so commonly\\npresent in this situation in the condition known as bunion.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Ganglion on lateral aspect of Knee in a young\\nwoman.]\\n\\nGanglionic cysts are met with in other situations than those mentioned,\\nbut they are so rare as not to require separate description.\\n\\nGanglia are to be diagnosed by their situation and physical characters;\\nenlarged bursae, synovial cysts, and new-growths are the swellings most\\nlikely to be mistaken for them. The diagnosis is sometimes only cleared\\nup by withdrawing the clear, jelly-like contents through a hollow\\nneedle.\\n\\n_Pathological Anatomy._--The wall of the cyst is composed of fibrous\\ntissue closely adherent to or fused with the surrounding tissues, so\\nthat it cannot be shelled out. There is no endothelial lining, and the\\nfibrous tissue of the wall is in immediate contact with the colloid\\nmaterial in the interior, which appears to be derived by a process of\\ndegeneration from the surrounding connective tissue. In the region of\\nthe knee the ganglion is usually multilocular, and consists of a\\nmeshwork of fibrous tissue, the meshes of which are occupied by colloid\\nmaterial.\\n\\nIt is often stated that a ganglion originates from a hernial protrusion\\nof the synovial membrane of a joint or tendon sheath. We have not been\\nable to demonstrate any communication between the cavity of the cyst\\nand that of an adjacent tendon sheath or joint. It is possible, however,\\nthat the cyst may originate from a minute portion of synovial membrane\\nbeing protruded and strangulated so that it becomes disconnected from\\nthat to which it originally belonged; it may then degenerate and give\\nrise to colloid material, which accumulates and forms a cyst. Ledderhose\\nand others regard ganglia as entirely new formations in the\\nperi-articular tissues, resulting from colloid degeneration of the\\nfibrous tissue of the capsular ligament, occurring at first in numerous\\nsmall areas which later coalesce. Ganglia are probably, therefore, of\\nthe nature of degeneration cysts arising in the capsule of joints, in\\ntendons, and in their sheaths.\\n\\n_Treatment._--A ganglion can usually be got rid of by a modification of\\nthe old-fashioned seton. The skin and cyst wall are transfixed by a\\nstout needle carrying a double thread of silkworm gut; some of the\\ncolourless jelly escapes from the punctures; the ends of the thread are\\ntied and cut short, and a dressing is applied. A week later the threads\\nare removed and the minute punctures are sealed with collodion. The\\naction of the threads is to convert the cyst wall into granulation\\ntissue, which undergoes the usual conversion into scar tissue. If the\\ncyst re-forms, it should be removed by open dissection under local\\nanaesthesia. Puncture with a tenotomy knife and scraping the interior,\\nand the injection of irritants, are alternative, but less satisfactory,\\nmethods of treatment.\\n\\n_Ganglia_ in the substance of _tendons_ are rare. The diagnosis rests on\\nthe observation that the small tumour is cystic, and that it follows the\\nmovements of the tendon. The cyst is at first multiple, but the\\npartitions disappear, and the spaces are thrown into one. The tendon is\\nso weakened that it readily ruptures. The best treatment is to resect\\nthe affected segment of tendon.\\n\\nThe so-called \"compound palmar ganglion\" is a tuberculous disease of the\\ntendon sheaths, and is described with diseases of tendon sheaths.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\nINJURIES\\n\\n\\nCONTUSIONS--WOUNDS: _Varieties_--WOUNDS BY FIREARMS AND\\n    EXPLOSIVES: _Pistol-shot wounds_; _Wounds by sporting guns_;\\n    _Wounds by rifle bullets_; _Wounds received in warfare_; _Shell\\n    wounds_. _Embedded foreign bodies_--BURNS AND\\n    SCALDS--INJURIES PRODUCED BY ELECTRICITY: _X-ray and\\n    radium_; _Electrical burns_; _Lightning stroke_.\\n\\n\\nCONTUSIONS\\n\\nA contusion or bruise is a laceration of the subcutaneous soft tissues,\\nwithout solution of continuity of the skin. When the integument gives\\nway at the same time, a _contused-wound_ results. Bruising occurs when\\nforce is applied to a part by means of a blunt object, whether as a\\ndirect blow, a crush, or a grazing form of violence. If the force acts\\nat right angles to the part, it tends to produce localised lesions which\\nextend deeply; while, if it acts obliquely, it gives rise to lesions\\nwhich are more diffuse, but comparatively superficial. It is well to\\nremember that those who suffer from scurvy, or haemophilia (bleeders),\\nand fat and anaemic females, are liable to be bruised by comparatively\\ntrivial injuries.\\n\\n_Clinical Features._--The less severe forms of contusion are associated\\nwith _ecchymosis_, numerous minute and discrete punctate haemorrhages\\nbeing scattered through the superficial layers of the skin, which is\\nslightly oedematous. The effused blood is soon reabsorbed.\\n\\nThe more severe forms are attended with _extravasation_, the\\nextravasated blood being widely diffused through the cellular tissue of\\nthe part, especially where this is loose and lax, as in the region of\\nthe orbit, the scrotum and perineum, and on the chest wall. A blue or\\nbluish-black discoloration occurs in patches, varying in size and depth\\nwith the degree of force which produced the injury, and in shape with\\nthe instrument employed. It is most intense in regions where the skin is\\nnaturally thin and pigmented. In parts where the extravasated blood is\\nonly separated from the oxygen of the air by a thin layer of epidermis\\nor by a mucous membrane, it retains its bright arterial colour. These\\npoints are often well illustrated in cases of black eye, where the blood\\neffused under the conjunctiva is bright red, while that in the eyelids\\nis almost black. In severe contusions associated with great tension of\\nthe skin--for example, over the front of the tibia or around the\\nankle--blisters often form on the surface and constitute a possible\\navenue of infection. When deeply situated, the blood tends to spread\\nalong the lines of least resistance, partly under the influence of\\ngravity, passing under fasciae, between muscles, along the sheaths of\\nvessels, or in connective-tissue spaces, so that it may only reach the\\nsurface after some time, and at a considerable distance from the seat of\\ninjury. This fact is sometimes of importance in diagnosis, as, for\\nexample, in certain fractures of the base of the skull, where\\ndiscoloration appears under the conjunctiva or behind the mastoid\\nprocess some days after the accident.\\n\\nBlood extravasated deeply in the tissues gives rise to a firm,\\nresistant, doughy swelling, in which there may be elicited on deep\\npalpation a peculiar sensation, not unlike the crepitus of fracture.\\n\\nIt frequently happens that, from the tearing of lymph vessels, serous\\nfluid is extravasated, and a _lymphatic_ or _serous cyst_ may form.\\n\\nIn all contusions accompanied by extravasation, there is marked swelling\\nof the area involved, as well as pain and tenderness. The temperature\\nmay rise to 101 o F., or, in the large extravasations that occur in\\nbleeders, even higher--a form of aseptic fever. The degree of shock is\\nvariable, but sudden syncope frequently results from severe bruises of\\nthe testicle, abdomen, or head, and occasionally marked nervous\\ndepression follows these injuries.\\n\\nContusion of muscles or nerves may produce partial atrophy and paresis,\\nas is often seen after injuries in the region of the shoulder.\\n\\nIn alcoholic or other debilitated patients, suppuration is liable to\\nensue in bruised parts, infection taking place from cocci circulating in\\nthe blood, or through the overlying skin.\\n\\n_Terminations of Contusions._--The usual termination is a complete\\nreturn to the normal, some of the extravasated blood being organised,\\nbut most of it being reabsorbed. During the process characteristic\\nalterations in the colour of the effused blood take place as a result of\\nchanges in the blood pigment. In from twenty-four to forty-eight hours\\nthe margins of the blue area become of a violet hue, and as time goes on\\nthe discoloured area increases in size, and becomes successively green,\\nyellow, and lemon-coloured at its margins, the central part being the\\nlast to change. The rate at which this play of colours proceeds is so\\nvariable, and depends on so many circumstances, that no time-limits can\\nbe laid down. During the disintegration of the effused blood the\\nadjacent lymph glands may become enlarged, and on dissection may be\\nfound to be pigmented. Sometimes the blood persists as a collection of\\nfluid with a newly formed connective-tissue capsule, constituting a\\n_haematoma_ or _blood cyst_, more often met with in the scalp than in\\nother parts.\\n\\nThe impairment of the blood supply of the skin may lead to the formation\\nof _blisters_, or to _necrosis_. Death of skin is more liable to occur\\nin bleeders, and when the slough separates the blood-clot is exposed and\\nthe reparative changes go on extremely slowly. _Suppuration_ may occur\\nand lead to the formation of an abscess as a result of direct infection\\nfrom the skin or through the circulation.\\n\\n_Treatment._--If the patient is seen immediately after the accident,\\nelevation of the part, and firm pressure applied by means of a thick pad\\nof cotton wool and an elastic bandage, are useful in preventing effusion\\nof blood. Ice-bags and evaporating lotions are to be used with caution,\\nas they are liable to lower the vitality of the damaged tissues and lead\\nto necrosis of the skin.\\n\\nWhen extravasation has already taken place, massage is the most speedy\\nand efficacious means of dispersing the effused blood. The part should\\nbe massaged several times a day, unless the presence of blebs or\\nabrasions of the skin prevents this being done. When this is the case,\\nthe use of antiseptic dressings is called for to prevent infection and\\nto promote healing, after which massage is employed.\\n\\nWhen the tension caused by the extravasated blood threatens the vitality\\nof the skin, incisions may be made, if asepsis can be assured. The blood\\nfrom a haematoma may be withdrawn by an exploring needle, and the\\npuncture sealed with collodion. Infective complications must be looked\\nfor and dealt with on general principles.\\n\\n\\nWOUNDS\\n\\nA wound is a solution in the continuity of the skin or mucous membrane\\nand of the underlying tissues, caused by violence.\\n\\nThree varieties of wounds are described: incised, punctured, and\\ncontused and lacerated.\\n\\n#Incised Wounds.#--Typical examples of incised wounds are those made by\\nthe surgeon in the course of an operation, wounds accidentally inflicted\\nby cutting instruments, and suicidal cut-throat wounds. It should be\\nborne in mind in connection with medico-legal inquiries, that wounds of\\nsoft parts that closely overlie a bone, such as the skull, the tibia, or\\nthe patella, although, inflicted by a blunt instrument, may have all the\\nappearances of incised wounds.\\n\\n_Clinical Features._--One of the characteristic features of an incised\\nwound is its tendency to gape. This is evident in long skin wounds, and\\nespecially when the cut runs across the part, or when it extends deeply\\nenough to divide muscular fibres at right angles to their long axis. The\\ngaping of a wound, further, is more marked when the underlying tissues\\nare in a state of tension--as, for example, in inflamed parts. Incised\\nwounds in the palm of the hand, the sole of the foot, or the scalp,\\nhowever, have little tendency to gape, because of the close attachment\\nof the skin to the underlying fascia.\\n\\nIncised wounds, especially in inflamed tissues, tend to bleed profusely;\\nand when a vessel is only partly divided and is therefore unable to\\ncontract, it continues to bleed longer than when completely cut across.\\n\\nThe _special risks_ of incised wounds are: (1) division of large blood\\nvessels, leading to profuse haemorrhage; (2) division of nerve-trunks,\\nresulting in motor and sensory disturbances; and (3) division of tendons\\nor muscles, interfering with movement.\\n\\n_Treatment._--If haemorrhage is still going on, it must be arrested by\\npressure, torsion, or ligature, as the accumulation of blood in a wound\\ninterferes with union. If necessary, the wound should be purified by\\nwashing with saline solution or eusol, and the surrounding skin painted\\nwith iodine, after which the edges are approximated by sutures. The raw\\nsurfaces must be brought into accurate apposition, care being taken that\\nno inversion of the cutaneous surface takes place. In extensive and deep\\nwounds, to ensure more complete closure and to prevent subsequent\\nstretching of the scar, it is advisable to unite the different\\nstructures--muscles, fasciae, and subcutaneous tissue--by separate series\\nof _buried sutures_ of catgut or other absorbable material. For the\\napproximation of the skin edges, stitches of horse-hair, fishing-gut, or\\nfine silk are the most appropriate. These _stitches of coaptation_ may\\nbe interrupted or continuous. In small superficial wounds on exposed\\nparts, stitch marks may be avoided by approximating the edges with\\nstrips of gauze fixed in position by collodion, or by subcutaneous\\nsutures of fine catgut. Where the skin is loose, as, for example, in the\\nneck, on the limbs, or in the scrotum, the use of Michel\\'s clips is\\nadvantageous in so far as these bring the deep surfaces of the skin into\\naccurate apposition, are introduced with comparatively little pain, and\\nleave only a slight mark if removed within forty-eight hours.\\n\\nWhen there is any difficulty in bringing the edges of the wound into\\napposition, a few interrupted _relaxation stitches_ may be introduced\\nwide of the margins, to take the strain off the coaptation stitches.\\nStout silk, fishing-gut, or silver wire may be employed for this\\npurpose. When the tension is extreme, Lister\\'s button suture may be\\nemployed. The tension is relieved and death of skin prevented by scoring\\nit freely with a sharp knife. Relaxation stitches should be removed in\\nfour or five days, and stitches of coaptation in from seven to ten days.\\nOn the face and neck, wounds heal rapidly, and stitches may be removed\\nin two or three days, thus diminishing the marks they leave.\\n\\n_Drainage._--In wounds in which no cavity has been left, and in which\\nthere is no reason to suspect infection, drainage is unnecessary. When,\\nhowever, the deeper parts of an extensive wound cannot be brought into\\naccurate apposition, and especially when there is any prospect of oozing\\nof blood or serum--as in amputation stumps or after excision of the\\nbreast--drainage is indicated. It is a wise precaution also to insert\\ndrainage tubes into wounds in fat patients when there is the slightest\\nreason to suspect the presence of infection. Glass or rubber tubes are\\nthe best drains; but where it is desirable to leave little mark, a few\\nstrands of horse-hair, or a small roll of rubber, form a satisfactory\\nsubstitute. Except when infection occurs, the drain is removed in from\\none to four days and the opening closed with a Michel\\'s clip or a\\nsuture.\\n\\n#Punctured Wounds.#--Punctured wounds are produced by narrow, pointed\\ninstruments, and the sharper and smoother the instrument the more does\\nthe resulting injury resemble an incised wound; while from more rounded\\nand rougher instruments the edges of the wound are more or less contused\\nor lacerated. The depth of punctured wounds greatly exceeds their width,\\nand the damage to subcutaneous parts is usually greater than that to the\\nskin. When the instrument transfixes a part, the edges of the wound of\\nentrance may be inverted, and those of the exit wound everted. If the\\ninstrument is a rough one, these conditions may be reversed by its\\nsudden withdrawal.\\n\\nPunctured wounds neither gape nor bleed much. Even when a large vessel\\nis implicated, the bleeding usually takes place into the tissues rather\\nthan externally.\\n\\nThe _risks_ incident to this class of wounds are: (1) the extreme\\ndifficulty, especially when a dense fascia has been perforated, of\\nrendering them aseptic, on account of the uncertainty as to their depth,\\nand of the way in which the surface wound closes on the withdrawal of\\nthe instrument; (2) different forms of aneurysm may result from the\\npuncture of a large vessel; (3) perforation of a joint, or of a serous\\ncavity, such as the abdomen, thorax, or skull, materially adds to the\\ndanger.\\n\\n_Treatment._--The first indication is to purify the whole extent of the\\nwound, and to remove any foreign body or blood-clot that may be in it.\\nIt is usually necessary to enlarge the wound, freely dividing injured\\nfasciae, paring away bruised tissues, and purifying the whole\\nwound-surface. Any blood vessel that is punctured should be cut across\\nand tied; and divided muscles, tendons, or nerves must be sutured. After\\nhaemorrhage has been arrested, iodoform and bismuth paste is rubbed into\\nthe raw surface, and the wound closed. If there is any reason to doubt\\nthe asepticity of the wound, it is better treated by the open method,\\nand a Bier\\'s bandage should be applied.\\n\\n#Contused and Lacerated Wounds.#--These may be considered together, as\\nthey so occur in practice. They are produced by crushing, biting, or\\ntearing forms of violence--such as result from machinery accidents,\\nfirearms, or the bites of animals. In addition to the irregular wound of\\nthe integument, there is always more or less bruising of the parts\\nbeneath and around, and the subcutaneous lesions are much wider than\\nappears on the surface.\\n\\nWounds of this variety usually gape considerably, especially when there\\nis much laceration of the skin. It is not uncommon to have considerable\\nportions of skin, muscle, or tendon completely torn away.\\n\\nHaemorrhage is seldom a prominent feature, as the crushing or tearing of\\nthe vessel wall leads to the obliteration of the lumen.\\n\\nThe _special risks_ of these wounds are: (1) Sloughing of the bruised\\ntissues, especially when attempts to sterilise the wound have not been\\nsuccessful. (2) Reactionary haemorrhage after the initial shock has\\npassed off. (3) Secondary haemorrhage as a result of infective processes\\nensuing in the wound. (4) Loss of muscle or tendon, interfering with\\nmotion. (5) Cicatricial contraction. (6) Gangrene, which may follow\\nocclusion of main vessels, or virulent infective processes. (7) It is\\nnot uncommon to have particles of carbon embedded in the tissues after\\nlacerated wounds, leaving unsightly, pigmented scars. This is often seen\\nin coal-miners, and in those injured by firearms, and is to be prevented\\nby removing all gross dirt from the edges of the wound.\\n\\n_Treatment._--In severe wounds of this class implicating the\\nextremities, the most important question that arises is whether or not\\nthe limb can be saved. In examining the limb, attention should first be\\ndirected to the state of the main blood vessels, in order to determine\\nif the vascular supply of the part beyond the lesion is sufficient to\\nmaintain its vitality. Amputation is usually called for if there is\\ncomplete absence of pulsation in the distal arteries and if the part\\nbeyond is cold. If at the same time important nerve-trunks are\\nlacerated, so that the function of the limb would be seriously impaired,\\nit is not worth running the risk of attempting to save it. If, in\\naddition, there is extensive destruction of large muscular masses or of\\nimportant tendons, or comminution of the bones, amputation is usually\\nimperative. Stripping of large areas of skin is not in itself a reason\\nfor removing a limb, as much can be done by skin grafting, but when it\\nis associated with other lesions it favours amputation. In considering\\nthese points, it must be borne in mind that the damage to the deeper\\ntissues is always more extensive than appears on the surface, and that\\nin many cases it is only possible to estimate the real extent of the\\ninjury by administering an anaesthetic and exploring the wound. In\\ndoubtful cases the possibility of rendering the parts aseptic will often\\ndecide the question for or against amputation. If thorough purification\\nis accomplished, the success which attends conservative measures is\\noften remarkable. It is permissible to run an amount of risk to save an\\nupper extremity which would be unjustifiable in the case of a lower\\nlimb. The age and occupation of the patient must also be taken into\\naccount.\\n\\nIt having been decided to try and save the limb, the question is only\\nsettled for the moment; it may have to be reconsidered from day to day,\\nor even from hour to hour, according to the progress of the case.\\n\\nWhen it is decided to make the attempt to save the limb, the wound must\\nbe thoroughly purified. All bruised tissue in which gross dirt has\\nbecome engrained should be cut away with knife or scissors. The raw\\nsurface is then cleansed with eusol, washed with sterilised salt\\nsolution followed by methylated spirit, and rubbed all over with \"bipp\"\\npaste. If the purification is considered satisfactory the wound may be\\nclosed, otherwise it is left open, freely drained or packed with gauze,\\nand the limb is immobilised by suitable splints.\\n\\n\\nWOUNDS BY FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES\\n\\nIt is not necessary here to do more than indicate the general characters\\nof wounds produced by modern weapons. For further details the reader is\\nreferred to works on military surgery. Experience has shown that the\\nnature and severity of the injuries sustained in warfare vary widely in\\n\\ndifferent campaigns, and even in different fields of the same campaign.\\nSlight variations in the size, shape, and weight of rifle bullets, for\\nexample, may profoundly modify the lesions they produce: witness the\\ndestructive effect of the pointed bullet compared with that of the\\nconical form previously used. The conditions under which the fighting is\\ncarried on also influence the wounds. Those sustained in the open,\\nlong-range fighting of the South African campaign of 1899-1902 were very\\ndifferent from those met with in the entrenched warfare in France in\\n1914-1918. It has been found also that the infective complications are\\ngreatly influenced by the terrain in which the fighting takes place. In\\nthe dry, sandy, uncultivated veldt of South Africa, bullet wounds seldom\\nbecame infected, while those sustained in the highly manured fields of\\nBelgium were almost invariably contaminated with putrefactive organisms,\\nand gaseous gangrene and tetanus were common complications. It has been\\nfound also that wounds inflicted in naval engagements present different\\ncharacters from those sustained on land. Many other factors, such as the\\nphysical and mental condition of the men, the facilities for affording\\nfirst aid, and the transport arrangements, also play a part in\\ndetermining the nature and condition of the wounds that have to be dealt\\nwith by military surgeons.\\n\\nWhatever the nature of the weapon concerned, the wound is of the\\n_punctured, contused, and lacerated_ variety. Its severity depends on\\nthe size, shape, and velocity of the missile, the range at which the\\nweapon is discharged, and the part of the body struck.\\n\\nShock is a prominent feature, but its degree, as well as the time of its\\nonset, varies with the extent and seat of the injury, and with the\\nmental state of the patient when wounded. We have observed pronounced\\nshock in children after being shot even when no serious injury was\\nsustained. At the moment of injury the patient experiences a sensation\\nwhich is variously described as being like the lash of a whip, a blow\\nwith a stick, or an electric shock. There is not much pain at first, but\\nlater it may become severe, and is usually associated with intense\\nthirst, especially when much blood has been lost.\\n\\nIn all forms of wounds sustained in warfare, septic infection\\nconstitutes the main risk, particularly that resulting from\\nstreptococci. The presence of anaerobic organisms introduces the\\nadditional danger of gaseous forms of gangrene.\\n\\nThe earlier the wound is disinfected the greater is the possibility of\\ndiminishing this risk. If cleansing is carried out within the first six\\nhours the chance of eliminating sepsis is good; with every succeeding\\nsix hours it diminishes, until after twenty-four hours it is seldom\\npossible to do more than mitigate sepsis. (J. T. Morrison.)\\n\\nThe presence of a metallic foreign body having been determined and its\\nposition localised by means of the X-rays, all devitalised and\\ncontaminated tissue is excised, the foreign material, _e.g._, a missile,\\nfragments of clothing, gravel and blood-clot, removed, the wound\\npurified with antiseptics and closed or drained according to\\ncircumstances.\\n\\n#Pistol-shot Wounds.#--Wounds inflicted by pistols, revolvers, and small\\nair-guns are of frequent occurrence in civil practice, the weapon being\\ndischarged usually by accident, but frequently with suicidal, and\\nsometimes with homicidal intent.\\n\\nWith all calibres and at all ranges, except actual contact, the wound of\\nentrance is smaller than the bullet. If the weapon is discharged within\\na foot of the body, the skin surrounding the wound is usually stained\\nwith powder and burned, and the hair singed. At ranges varying from six\\ninches to thirty feet, grains of powder may be found embedded in the\\nskin or lying loose on the surface, the greater the range the wider\\nbeing the area of spread. When black powder is used, the embedded grains\\nusually leave a permanent bluish-black tattooing of the skin. When the\\nweapon is placed in contact with the skin, the subcutaneous tissues are\\nlacerated over an area of two or three inches around the opening made by\\nthe bullet and smoke and powder-staining and scorching are more marked\\nthan at longer ranges.\\n\\nWhen the bullet perforates, the exit wound is usually larger and more\\nextensively lacerated than the wound of entrance. Its margins are as a\\nrule everted, and it shows no marks of flame, smoke, or powder. These\\nfeatures are common to all perforations caused by bullets.\\n\\nPistol wounds only produce dangerous effects when fired at close range,\\nand when the cavities of the skull, the thorax, or the abdomen are\\nimplicated. In the abdomen a lethal injury may readily be caused even by\\npistols of the \"toy\" order. These injuries will be described with\\nregional surgery.\\n\\nPistol-shot wounds of _joints_ and _soft parts_ are seldom of serious\\nimport apart from the risk of haemorrhage and of infection.\\n\\n_Treatment._--The treatment of wounds of the soft parts consists in\\npurifying the wounds of entrance and exit and the surrounding skin, and\\nin providing for drainage if this is indicated.\\n\\nThere being no urgency for the removal of the bullet, time should be\\ntaken to have it localised by the X-rays, preferably by stereoscopic\\nplates. In some cases it is not necessary to remove the bullet.\\n\\n#Wounds by Sporting Guns.#--In the common sporting or scatter gun, with\\nwhich accidents so commonly occur during the shooting season, the charge\\nof small shot or pellets leave the muzzle of the gun as a solid mass\\nwhich makes a single ragged wound having much the appearance of that\\ncaused by a single bullet. At a distance of from four to five feet from\\nthe muzzle the pellets begin to disperse so that there are separate\\npunctures around the main central wound. As the range increases, these\\noutlying punctures make a wider and wider pattern, until at a distance\\nof from eighteen to twenty feet from the muzzle, the scattering is\\ncomplete, there is no longer any central wound, and each individual\\npellet makes its own puncture. From these elementary data, it is usually\\npossible, from the features of the wound, to arrive at an approximately\\naccurate conclusion regarding the range at which the gun was discharged,\\nand this may have an important bearing on the question of accident,\\nsuicide, or murder.\\n\\nAs regards the effects on the tissues at close range, that is, within a\\nfew feet, there is widespread laceration and disruption; if a bone is\\nstruck it is shattered, and portions of bone may be displaced or even\\ndriven out through the exit wound.\\n\\nWhen the charge impinges over one of the large cavities of the body, the\\nshot may scatter widely through the contained viscera, and there is\\noften no exit wound. In the thorax, for example, if a rib is struck, the\\ncharge and possibly fragments of bone, will penetrate the pleura, and be\\ndispersed throughout the lung; in the head, the skull may be shattered\\nand the brain torn up; and in the abdomen, the hollow viscera may be\\nperforated in many places and the solid organs lacerated.\\n\\nOn covered parts the clothing, by deflecting the shot, influences the\\nsize and shape of the wound; the entrance wound is increased in size and\\nmore ragged, and portions of the clothes may be driven into the tissues.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--Radiogram showing Pellets embedded in Arm.\\n\\n(Mr. J. W. Dowden\\'s case.)]\\n\\nA charge of small shot is much more destructive to blood vessels,\\ntendons, and ligaments than a single bullet, which in many cases pushes\\nsuch structures aside without dividing them. In the abdomen and chest,\\nalso, the damage done by a full charge of shot is much more extensive\\nthan that inflicted by a single bullet, the deflection of the pellets\\nleading to a greater number of perforations of the intestine and more\\nwidespread laceration of solid viscera.\\n\\nWhen the charge impinges on one of the extremities at close range, we\\noften have the opportunity of observing that the exit wound is larger,\\nmore ragged than that of entrance, and that its edges are everted; the\\nextensive tearing and bruising of all the tissues, including the bones,\\nand the marked tendency to early and progressive septic infection,\\nrender amputation compulsory in the majority of such cases.\\n\\nAt a range of from twenty to thirty feet, although the scatter is\\ncomplete, the pellets are still close together, so that if they\\nencounter the shaft of a long bone, even the femur, they fracture the\\nbone across, often along with some longitudinal splintering.\\n\\nIndividual pellets striking the shafts of long bones become flattened or\\ndistorted, and when cancellated bone is struck they become embedded in\\nit (Fig. 62).\\n\\nThe skin, when it is closely peppered with shot, is liable to lose its\\nvitality, and with the addition of a little sepsis, readily necroses and\\ncomes away as a slough.\\n\\nWhen the shot have diverged so as to strike singly, they seldom do much\\nharm, but fatal damage may be done to the brain or to the aorta, or the\\neye may be seriously injured by a single pellet.\\n\\nSmall shot fired at longer ranges--over about a hundred and fifty\\nfeet--usually go through the skin, but seldom pierce the fascia, and lie\\nembedded in the subcutaneous tissue, from which they can readily be\\nextracted.\\n\\nThe wad of the cartridge behaves erratically: so long as it remains flat\\nit goes off with the rest of the charge, and is often buried in the\\nwound; but if it curls up or turns on its side, it is usually deflected\\nand flies clear of the shot. It may make a separate wound.\\n\\nWounds from sporting guns are to be _treated_ on the usual lines, the\\nearly efforts being directed to the alleviation of shock and the\\nprevention of septic infection. There is rarely any urgency in the\\nremoval of pellets from the tissues.\\n\\n#Wounds by Rifle Bullets.#--The vast majority of wounds inflicted by\\nrifle bullets are met with in the field during active warfare, and fall\\nto be treated by military surgeons. They occasionally occur\\naccidentally, however, during range practice for example, and may then\\ncome under the notice of the civil surgeon.\\n\\nIt is only necessary here to consider the effects of modern small-bore\\nrifle or machine-gun bullets.\\n\\nThe trajectory is practically flat up to 675 yards. In destructive\\neffect there is not much difference between the various high velocity\\nbullets used in different armies; they will kill up to a distance of two\\nmiles. The hard covering is employed to enable the bullet to take the\\ngrooves in the rifle, and to prevent it stripping as it passes through\\nthe barrel. It also increases the penetrating power of the missile, but\\ndiminishes its \"stopping\" power, unless a vital part or a long bone is\\nstruck. By removing the covering from the point of the bullet, as is\\ndone in the Dum-Dum bullet, or by splitting the end, the bullet is made\\nto expand or \"mushroom\" when it strikes the body, and its stopping power\\nis thereby greatly increased, the resulting wound being much more\\nsevere. These \"soft-nosed\" expanding bullets are to be distinguished\\nfrom \"explosive\" bullets which contain substances which detonate on\\nimpact. High velocity bullets are unlikely to lodge in the body unless\\nspent, or pulled up by a sandbag, or metal buckle on a belt, or a book\\nin the pocket, or the core and the case separating--\"stripping\" of the\\nbullet. Spent shot may merely cause bruising of the surface, or they may\\npass through the skin and lodge in the subcutaneous tissue, or may even\\ndamage some deeper structure such as a nerve trunk.\\n\\nA blank cartridge fired at close range may cause a severe wound, and, if\\ncharged with black powder, may leave a permanent bluish-black\\npigmentation of the skin.\\n\\nThe lesions of individual tissues--bones, nerves, blood vessels--are\\nconsidered with these.\\n\\n#Treatment of Gunshot Wounds under War Conditions.#--It is only\\nnecessary to indicate briefly the method of dealing with gunshot wounds\\nin warfare as practised in the European War.\\n\\n1. _On the Field._--Haemorrhage is arrested in the limbs by an improvised\\ntourniquet; in the head by a pad and bandage; in the thorax or abdomen\\nby packing if necessary, but this should be avoided if possible, as it\\nfavours septic infection. If a limb is all but detached it should be\\ncompletely severed. A full dose of morphin is given hypodermically. The\\nampoule of iodine carried by the wounded man is broken, and its contents\\nare poured over and around the wound, after which the field dressing is\\napplied. In extensive wounds, the \"shell-dressing\" carried by the\\nstretcher bearers is preferred. All bandages are applied loosely to\\nallow for subsequent swelling. The fragments of fractured bones are\\nimmobilised by some form of emergency splint.\\n\\n2. _At the Advanced Dressing Station_, after the patient has had a\\nliberal allowance of warm fluid nourishment, such as soup or tea, a full\\ndose of anti-tetanic serum is injected. The tourniquet is removed and\\nthe wound inspected. Urgent amputations are performed. Moribund patients\\nare detained lest they die _en route_.\\n\\n3. _In the Field Ambulance or Casualty Clearing Station_ further\\nmeasures are employed for the relief of shock, and urgent operations are\\nperformed, such as amputation for gangrene, tracheotomy for dyspnoea, or\\nlaparotomy for perforated or lacerated intestine. In the majority of\\ncases the main object is to guard against infection; the skin is\\ndisinfected over a wide area and surrounded with towels; damaged tissue,\\nespecially muscle, is removed with the knife or scissors, and foreign\\nbodies are extracted. Torn blood vessels, and, if possible, nerves and\\ntendons are repaired. The wound is then partly closed, provision being\\nmade for free drainage, or some special method of irrigation, such as\\nthat of Carrel, is adopted. Sometimes the wound is treated with bismuth,\\niodoform, and paraffin paste (B.I.P.P.) and sutured.\\n\\n4. _In the Base Hospital or Hospital Ship_ various measures may be\\ncalled for according to the progress of the wound and the condition of\\nthe patient.\\n\\n#Shell Wounds and Wounds produced by Explosions.#--It is convenient to\\nconsider together the effects of the bursting of shells fired from heavy\\nordnance and those resulting in the course of blasting operations from\\nthe discharge of dynamite or other explosives, or from the bursting of\\nsteam boilers or pipes, the breaking of machinery, and similar accidents\\nmet with in civil practice.\\n\\nWounds inflicted by shell fragments and shrapnel bullets tend to be\\nextensive in area, and show great contusion, laceration, and destruction\\nof the tissues. The missiles frequently lodge and carry portions of the\\nclothing and, it may be, articles from the man\\'s pocket, with them.\\nShell wounds are attended with a considerable degree of shock. On\\naccount of the wide area of contusion which surrounds the actual wound\\nproduced by shell fragments, amputation, when called for, should be\\nperformed some distance above the torn tissues, as there is considerable\\nrisk of sloughing of the flaps.\\n\\nWounds produced by dynamite explosions and the bursting of boilers have\\nthe same general characters as shell wounds. Fragments of stone, coal,\\nor metal may lodge in the tissues, and favour the occurrence of\\ninfective complications.\\n\\nAll such injuries are to be treated on the general principles governing\\ncontused and lacerated wounds.\\n\\n\\nEMBEDDED FOREIGN BODIES\\n\\nIn the course of many operations foreign substances are introduced into\\nthe tissues and intentionally left there, for example, suture and\\nligature materials, steel or aluminium plates, silver wire or ivory pegs\\nused to secure the fixation of bones, or solid paraffin employed to\\ncorrect deformities. Other substances, such as gauze, drainage tubes,\\nor metal instruments, may be unintentionally left in a wound.\\n\\nForeign bodies may also lodge in accidentally inflicted wounds, for\\nexample, bullets, needles, splinters of wood, or fragments of clothing.\\nThe needles of hypodermic syringes sometimes break and a portion remains\\nembedded in the tissues. As a result of explosions, particles of carbon,\\nin the form of coal-dust or gunpowder, or portions of shale, may lodge\\nin a wound.\\n\\nThe embedded foreign body at first acts as an irritant, and induces a\\nreaction in the tissues in which it lodges, in the form of hyperaemia,\\nlocal leucocytosis, proliferation of fibroblasts, and the formation of\\ngranulation tissue. The subsequent changes depend upon whether or not\\nthe wound is infected with pyogenic bacteria. If it is so infected,\\nsuppuration ensues, a sinus forms, and persists until the foreign body\\nis either cast out or removed.\\n\\nIf the wound is aseptic, the fate of the foreign body varies with its\\ncharacter. A substance that is absorbable, such as catgut or fine silk,\\nis surrounded and permeated by the phagocytes, which soften and\\ndisintegrate it, the debris being gradually absorbed in much the same\\nmanner as a fibrinous exudate. Minute bodies that are not capable of\\nbeing absorbed, such as particles of carbon, or of pigment used in\\ntattooing, are taken up by the phagocytes, and in course of time\\nremoved. Larger bodies, such as needles or bullets, which are not\\ncapable of being destroyed by the phagocytes, become encapsulated. In\\nthe granulation tissue by which they are surrounded large multinuclear\\ngiant-cells appear (\"_foreign-body giant-cells_\") and attach themselves\\nto the foreign body, the fibroblasts proliferate and a capsule of scar\\ntissue is eventually formed around the body. The tissues of the capsule\\nmay show evidence of iron pigmentation. Sometimes fluid accumulates\\naround a foreign body within its capsule, constituting a cyst.\\n\\nSubstances like paraffin, strands of silk used to bridge a gap in a\\ntendon, or portions of calcined bone, instead of being encapsulated, are\\ngradually permeated and eventually replaced by new connective tissue.\\n\\nEmbedded bodies may remain in the tissues for an indefinite period\\nwithout giving rise to inconvenience. At any time, however, they may\\ncause trouble, either as a result of infective complications, or by\\ninducing the formation of a mass of inflammatory tissue around them,\\nwhich may simulate a gumma, a tuberculous focus, or a sarcoma. This\\nlatter condition may give rise to difficulties in diagnosis,\\nparticularly if there is no history forthcoming of the entrance of the\\nforeign body. The ignorance of patients regarding the possible lodgment\\nin the tissues of a foreign body--even of considerable size--is\\nremarkable. In such cases the X-rays will reveal the presence of the\\nforeign body if it is sufficiently opaque to cast a shadow. The heavy,\\nlead-containing varieties of glass throw very definite shadows little\\ninferior in sharpness and definition to those of metal; almost all the\\nordinary forms of commercial glass also may be shown up by the X-rays.\\n\\nForeign bodies encapsulated in the peritoneal cavity are specially\\ndangerous, as the proximity of the intestine furnishes a constant\\npossibility of infection.\\n\\nThe question of removal of the foreign body must be decided according to\\nthe conditions present in individual cases; in searching for a foreign\\nbody in the tissues, unless it has been accurately located, a general\\nanaesthetic is to be preferred.\\n\\n\\nBURNS AND SCALDS\\n\\nThe distinction between a burn which results from the action of dry heat\\non the tissues of the body and a scald which results from the action of\\nmoist heat, has no clinical significance.\\n\\nIn young and debilitated subjects hot poultices may produce injuries of\\nthe nature of burns. In old people with enfeebled circulation mere\\nexposure to a strong fire may cause severe degrees of burning, the\\nclothes covering the part being uninjured. This may also occur about the\\nfeet, legs, or knees of persons while intoxicated who have fallen asleep\\nbefore the fire.\\n\\nThe damage done to the tissues by strong caustics, such as fuming nitric\\nacid, sulphuric acid, caustic potash, nitrate of silver, or arsenical\\npaste, presents pathological and clinical features almost identical with\\nthose resulting from heat. Electricity and the Rontgen rays also produce\\nlesions of the nature of burns.\\n\\n_Pathology of Burns._--Much discussion has taken place regarding the\\nexplanation of the rapidly fatal issue in extensive superficial burns.\\nOn post-mortem examination the lesions found in these cases are: (1)\\ngeneral hyperaemia of all the organs of the abdominal, thoracic, and\\ncerebro-spinal cavities; (2) marked leucocytosis, with destruction of\\nred corpuscles, setting free haemoglobin which lodges in the epithelial\\ncells of the tubules of the kidneys; (3) minute thrombi and\\nextravasations throughout the tissues of the body; (4) degeneration of\\nthe ganglion cells of the solar plexus; (5) oedema and degeneration of\\nthe lymphoid tissue throughout the body; (6) cloudy swelling of the\\nliver and kidneys, and softening and enlargement of the spleen. Bardeen\\nsuggests that these morbid phenomena correspond so closely to those met\\nwith where the presence of a toxin is known to produce them, that in all\\nprobability death is similarly due to the action of some poison produced\\nby the action of heat on the skin and on the proteins of the blood.\\n\\n#Clinical Features--Local Phenomena.#--The most generally accepted\\nclassification of burns is that of Dupuytren, which is based upon the\\ndepth of the lesion. Six degrees are thus, recognised: (1) hyperaemia or\\nerythema; (2) vesication; (3) partial destruction of the true skin; (4)\\ntotal destruction of the true skin; (5) charring of muscles; (6)\\ncharring of bones.\\n\\nIt must be observed, however, that burns met with at the bedside always\\nillustrate more than one of these degrees, the deeper forms always being\\nassociated with those less deep, and the clinical picture is made up of\\nthe combined characters of all. A burn is classified in terms of its\\nmost severe portion. It is also to be remarked that the extent and\\nseverity of a burn usually prove to be greater than at first sight\\nappears.\\n\\n_Burns of the first degree_ are associated with erythema of the skin,\\ndue to hyperaemia of its blood vessels, and result from scorching by\\nflame, from contact with solids or fluids below 212 o F., or from\\nexposure to the sun\\'s rays. They are characterised clinically by acute\\npain, redness, transitory swelling from oedema, and subsequent\\ndesquamation of the surface layers of the epidermis. A special form of\\npigmentation of the skin is seen on the front of the legs of women from\\nexposure to the heat of the fire.\\n\\n_Burns of Second Degree--Vesication of the Skin._--These are\\ncharacterised by the occurrence of vesicles or blisters which are\\nscattered over the hyperaemic area, and contain a clear yellowish or\\nbrownish fluid. On removing the raised epidermis, the congested and\\nhighly sensitive papillae of the skin are exposed. Unna has found that\\npyogenic bacteria are invariably present in these blisters. Burns of the\\nsecond degree leave no scar but frequently a persistent discoloration.\\nIn rare instances the burned area becomes the seat of a peculiar\\novergrowth of fibrous tissue of the nature of keloid (p 401).\\n\\n_Burns of Third Degree--Partial Destruction of the Skin._--The epidermis\\nand papillae are destroyed in patches, leaving hard, dry, and insensitive\\nsloughs of a yellow or black colour. The pain in these burns is\\nintense, but passes off during the first or second day, to return again,\\nhowever, when, about the end of a week, the sloughs separate and expose\\nthe nerve filaments of the underlying skin. Granulations spring up to\\nfill the gap, and are rapidly covered by epithelium, derived partly from\\nthe margins and partly from the remains of skin glands which have not\\nbeen completely destroyed. These latter appear on the surface of the\\ngranulations as small bluish islets which gradually increase in size,\\nbecome of a greyish-white colour, and ultimately blend with one another\\nand with the edges. The resulting cicatrix may be slightly depressed,\\nbut otherwise exhibits little tendency to contract and cause deformity.\\n\\n_Burns of Fourth Degree--Total Destruction of the Skin._--These follow\\nthe more prolonged action of any form of intense heat. Large, black, dry\\neschars are formed, surrounded by a zone of intense congestion. Pain is\\nless severe, and is referred to the parts that have been burned to a\\nless degree. Infection is liable to occur and to lead to wide\\ndestruction of the surrounding skin. The amount of granulation tissue\\nnecessary to fill the gap is therefore great; and as the epithelial\\ncovering can only be derived from the margins--the skin glands being\\ncompletely destroyed--the healing process is slow. The resulting scars\\nare irregular, deep and puckered, and show a great tendency to contract.\\nKeloid frequently develops in such cicatrices. When situated in the\\nregion of the face, neck, or flexures of joints, much deformity and\\nimpairment of function may result (Fig. 63).\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--Cicatricial Contraction following Severe Burn.]\\n\\nIn _burns of the fifth degree_ the lesion extends through the\\nsubcutaneous tissue and involves the muscles; while in those of the\\n_sixth degree_ it passes still more deeply and implicates the bones.\\nThese burns are comparatively limited in area, as they are usually\\nproduced by prolonged contact with hot metal or caustics. Burns of the\\nfifth and sixth degrees are met with in epileptics or intoxicated\\npersons who fall into the fire. Large blood vessels, nerve-trunks,\\njoints, or serous cavities may be implicated.\\n\\n#General Phenomena.#--It is customary to divide the clinical history of\\na severe burn into three periods; but it is to be observed that the\\nfeatures characteristic of the periods have been greatly modified since\\nburns have been treated on the same lines as other wounds.\\n\\n_The first period_ lasts for from thirty-six to forty-eight hours,\\nduring which time the patient remains in a more or less profound state\\nof _shock_, and there is a remarkable absence of pain. When shock is\\nabsent or little marked, however, the amount of suffering may be great.\\nWhen the injury proves fatal during this period, death is due to shock,\\nprobably aggravated by the absorption of poisonous substances produced\\nin the burned tissues. In fatal cases there is often evidence of\\ncerebral congestion and oedema.\\n\\nThe _second period_ begins when the shock passes off, and lasts till the\\nsloughs separate. The outstanding feature of this period is _toxaemia_,\\nmanifested by fever, the temperature rising to 102 o, 103 o, or 104 o F.,\\nand congestive or inflammatory conditions of internal organs, giving\\nrise to such clinical complications as bronchitis, broncho-pneumonia, or\\npleurisy--especially in burns of the thorax; or meningitis and\\ncerebritis, when the neck or head is the seat of the burn. Intestinal\\ncatarrh associated with diarrhoea is not uncommon; and ulceration of the\\nduodenum leading to perforation has been met with in a few cases. These\\nphenomena are much more prominent when bacterial infection has taken\\nplace, and it seems probable that they are to be attributed chiefly to\\nthe infection, as they have become less frequent and less severe since\\nburns have been treated like other breaches of the surface. Albuminuria\\nis a fairly constant symptom in severe burns, and is associated with\\ncongestion of the kidneys. In burns implicating the face, neck, mouth,\\nor pharynx, oedema of the glottis is a dangerous complication, entailing\\nas it does the risk of suffocation.\\n\\nThe _third period_ begins when the sloughs separate, usually between\\nthe seventh and fourteenth days, and lasts till the wound heals, its\\nduration depending upon the size, depth, and asepticity of the raw area.\\nThe chief causes of death during this period are toxin absorption in any\\nof its forms; waxy disease of the liver, kidneys, or intestine; less\\ncommonly erysipelas, tetanus, or other diseases due to infection by\\nspecific organisms. We have seen nothing to substantiate the belief that\\nduodenal ulcers are liable to perforate during the third period.\\n\\nThe _prognosis_ in burns depends on (1) the superficial extent, and, to\\na much less degree, the depth of the injury. When more than one-third of\\nthe entire surface of the body is involved, even in a mild degree, the\\nprognosis is grave. (2) The situation of the burn is important. Burns\\nover the serous cavities--abdomen, thorax, or skull--are, other things\\nbeing equal, much more dangerous than burns of the limbs. The risk of\\noedema of the glottis in burns about the neck and mouth has already been\\nreferred to. (3) Children are more liable to succumb to shock during the\\nearly period, but withstand prolonged suppuration better than adults.\\n(4) When the patient survives the shock, the presence or absence of\\ninfection is the all-important factor in prognosis.\\n\\n#Treatment.#--The _general treatment_ consists in combating the shock.\\nWhen pain is severe, morphin must be injected.\\n\\n_Local Treatment._--The local treatment must be carried out on\\nantiseptic lines, a general anaesthetic being administered, if necessary,\\nto enable the purification to be carried out thoroughly. After carefully\\nremoving the clothing, the whole of the burned area is gently, but\\nthoroughly, cleansed with peroxide of hydrogen or warm boracic lotion,\\nfollowed by sterilised saline solution. As pyogenic bacteria are\\ninvariably found in the blisters of burns, these must be opened and the\\nraised epithelium removed.\\n\\nThe dressings subsequently applied should meet the following\\nindications: the relief of pain; the prevention of sepsis; and the\\npromotion of cicatrisation.\\n\\nAn application which satisfactorily fulfils these requirements is\\n_picric acid_. Pads of lint or gauze are lightly wrung out of a solution\\nmade up of picric acid, 1 1/2 drams; absolute alcohol, 3 ounces;\\ndistilled water, 40 ounces, and applied over the whole of the reddened\\narea. These are covered with antiseptic wool, _without_ any waterproof\\ncovering, and retained in position by a many-tailed bandage. The\\ndressing should be changed once or twice a week, under the guidance of\\nthe temperature chart, any portion of the original dressing which\\nremains perfectly dry being left undisturbed. The value of a general\\nanaesthetic in dressing extensive burns, especially in children, can\\nscarcely be overestimated.\\n\\nPicric acid yields its best results in superficial burns, and it is\\nuseful as _a primary dressing_ in all. As soon as the sloughs separate\\nand a granulating surface forms, the ordinary treatment for a healing\\nsore is instituted. Any slough under which pus has collected should be\\ncut away with scissors to permit of free drainage.\\n\\nAn occlusive dressing of melted _paraffin_ has also been employed. A\\nuseful preparation consists of: Paraffin molle 25 per cent., paraffin\\ndurum 67 per cent., olive oil 5 per cent., oil of eucalyptus 2 per\\ncent., and beta-naphthol 1/4 per cent. It has a melting point of 48 o C.\\nIt is also known as _Ambrine_ and _Burnol_. After the burned area has\\nbeen cleansed and thoroughly dried, it is sponged or painted with the\\nmelted paraffin, and before solidification takes place a layer of\\nsterilised gauze is applied and covered with a second coating of\\nparaffin. Further coats of paraffin are applied every other day to\\nprevent the gauze sticking to the skin.\\n\\nAn alternative method of treating extensive burns is by immersing the\\npart, or even the whole body when the trunk is affected, in a bath of\\nboracic lotion kept at the body temperature, the lotion being frequently\\nrenewed.\\n\\nIf a burn is already infected when first seen, it is to be treated on\\nthe same principles as govern the treatment of other infected wounds.\\n\\nAll moist or greasy applications, such as Carron oil, carbolic oil and\\nointments, and all substances like collodion and dry powders, which\\nretain discharges, entirely fail to meet the indications for the\\nrational treatment of burns, and should be abandoned.\\n\\nSkin-grafting is of great value in hastening healing after extensive\\nburns, and in preventing cicatricial contraction. The _deformities_\\nwhich are so liable to develop from contraction of the cicatrices are\\ntreated on general principles. In the region of the face, neck, and\\nflexures of joints (Fig. 63), where they are most marked, the contracted\\nbands may be divided and the parts stretched, the raw surface left being\\ncovered by Thiersch grafts or by flaps of skin raised from adjacent\\nsurfaces or from other parts of the body (Fig. 1).\\n\\n\\nINJURIES PRODUCED BY ELECTRICITY\\n\\n#Injuries produced by Exposure to X-Rays and Radium.#--In the routine\\ntreatment of disease by radiations, injury is sometimes done to the\\ntissues, even when the greatest care is exercised as to dosage and\\nfrequency of application. Robert Knox describes the following\\nill-effects.\\n\\n_Acute dermatitis_ varying in degree from a slight erythema to deep\\nulceration or even necrosis of skin. When ulcers form they are extremely\\npainful and slow to heal. When hair-bearing areas are affected,\\nepilation may occur without destroying the hair follicles and the hairs\\nare reproduced, but if the reaction is excessive permanent alopecia may\\nresult.\\n\\n_Chronic dermatitis_, which results from persistence of the acute form,\\nis most intractable and may assume malignant characters. X-ray warts are\\na late manifestation of chronic dermatitis and may become malignant.\\n\\nAmong the _late manifestations_ are neuritis, telangiectasis, and a\\npainful and intractable form of ulceration, any of which may come on\\nmonths or even years after the cessation of exposure. _Sterility_ may be\\ninduced in X-ray workers who are imperfectly protected from the effects\\nof the rays.\\n\\n#Electrical burns# usually occur in those who are engaged in industrial\\nundertakings where powerful electrical currents are employed.\\n\\nThe lesions--which vary from a slight superficial scorching to complete\\ncharring of parts--are most evident at the points of entrance and exit\\nof the current, the intervening tissues apparently escaping injury.\\n\\nThe more superficial degrees of electrical burns differ from those\\nproduced by heat in being almost painless, and in healing very slowly,\\nalthough as a rule they remain dry and aseptic.\\n\\nThe more severe forms are attended with a considerable degree of shock,\\nwhich is not only more profound, but also lasts much longer than the\\nshock in an ordinary burn of corresponding severity. The parts at the\\npoint of entrance of the current are charred to a greater or lesser\\ndepth. The eschar is at first dry and crisp, and is surrounded by a zone\\nof pallor. For the first thirty-six to forty-eight hours there is\\ncomparatively little suffering, but at the end of that time the parts\\nbecome exceedingly painful. In a majority of cases, in spite of careful\\npurification, a slow form of moist gangrene sets in, and the slough\\nspreads both in area and in depth, until the muscles and often the\\nlarge blood vessels and nerves are exposed. A line of demarcation\\neventually forms, but the sloughs are exceedingly slow to separate,\\ntaking from three to five times as long as in an ordinary burn, and\\nduring the process of separation there is considerable risk of secondary\\nhaemorrhage from erosion of large vessels.\\n'"

      "The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.\n",
      "Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.\n",
      "Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). They mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia, dogs have uniquely adapted to human behavior; this adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans. As such, the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs' influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of \"man's best friend\".\n",
      "The global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the world. The dog is the most popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households. Developed countries make up approximately 20% of the global dog population, while around 75% of dogs are estimated to be from developing countries, mainly in the form of feral and community dogs.\n",

      "== Taxonomy ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Dogs are domesticated members of the family Canidae. They are classified as a subspecies of Canis lupus, along with wolves and dingoes. Dogs were domesticated from wolves over 14,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers, before the development of agriculture. The remains of the Bonn–Oberkassel dog, buried alongside humans between 14,000 and 15,000 years ago, are the earliest to be conclusively identified as a domesticated dog. Genetic studies show that dogs likely diverged from wolves between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago. The dingo and the related New Guinea singing dog resulted from the geographic isolation and feralization of dogs in Oceania over 8,000 years ago.\n",
      "Dogs, wolves, and dingoes have sometimes been classified as separate species. In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus assigned the genus name Canis (which is the Latin word for \"dog\") to the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal in his book, Systema Naturae. He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris and, on the next page, classified the grey wolf as Canis lupus. Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata in Latin term), which is not found in any other canid. In the 2005 edition of Mammal Species of the World, mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed the wolf as a wild subspecies of Canis lupus and proposed two additional subspecies: familiaris, as named by Linnaeus in 1758, and dingo, named by Meyer in 1793. Wozencraft included hallstromi (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name (junior synonym) for the dingo. This classification was informed by a 1999 mitochondrial DNA study.\n",
      "The classification of dingoes is disputed and a political issue in Australia. Classifying dingoes as wild dogs simplifies reducing or controlling dingo populations that threaten livestock. Treating dingoes as a separate species allows conservation programs to protect the dingo population. Dingo classification affects wildlife management policies, legislation, and societal attitudes. In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the dingo and the New Guinea singing dog to be feral Canis familiaris. Therefore, it did not assess them for the IUCN Red List of threatened species.\n",

      "=== Domestication ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany. Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf. The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under large, thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of canine distemper. This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be domesticated in the time of hunter-gatherers, which predates agriculture. Earlier remains dating back to 30,000 years ago have been described as Paleolithic dogs, but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated because considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the Late Pleistocene.\n",
      "DNA sequences show that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population that was distinct from any modern wolf lineage. Some studies have posited that all living wolves are more closely related to each other than to dogs, while others have suggested that dogs are more closely related to modern Eurasian wolves than to American wolves.\n",
      "The dog is a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal pathway into domestication (i.e. humans initially neither benefitted nor were harmed by wild dogs eating refuse from their camps). The questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated remains uncertain. Genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000 years ago, in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or eastern Asia. In 2021, a literature review of the current evidence infers that the dog was domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by ancient North Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia, with dogs likely accompanying the first humans to inhabit the Americas. Some studies have suggested that the extinct Japanese wolf is closely related to the ancestor of domestic dogs.\n",
      "In 2018, a study identified 429 genes that differed between modern dogs and modern wolves. As the differences in these genes could also be found in ancient dog fossils, these were regarded as being the result of the initial domestication and not from recent breed formation. These genes are linked to neural crest and central nervous system development. These genes affect embryogenesis and can confer tameness, smaller jaws, floppy ears, and diminished craniofacial development, which distinguish domesticated dogs from wolves and are considered to reflect domestication syndrome. The study concluded that during early dog domestication, the initial selection was for behavior. This trait is influenced by those genes which act in the neural crest, which led to the phenotypes observed in modern dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Breeds ===\n",
      "\n",
      " There are around 450 official dog breeds, the most of any mammal. Dogs began diversifying in the Victorian era, when humans took control of their natural selection. Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years. Since then, dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and have been subjected to artificial selection by humans. The skull, body, and limb proportions between breeds display more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type, and colour. As such, humans have long used dogs for their desirable traits to complete or fulfill a certain work or role. Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, hunting, retrieving, and scent detection. Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression. Present-day dogs are dispersed around the world. An example of this dispersal is the numerous modern breeds of European lineage during the Victorian era.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Size and skeleton ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Dogs are extremely variable in size, ranging from one of the largest breeds, the Great Dane, at 50 to 79 kg (110 to 174 lb) and 71 to 81 cm (28 to 32 in), to one of the smallest, the Chihuahua, at 0.5 to 3 kg (1.1 to 6.6 lb) and 13 to 20 cm (5.1 to 7.9 in). All healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have the same amount of bones (with the exception of the tail), although there is significant skeletal variation between dogs of different types. The dog's skeleton is well adapted for running; the vertebrae on the neck and back have extensions for back muscles, consisting of epaxial muscles and hypaxial muscles, to connect to; the long ribs provide room for the heart and lungs; and the shoulders are unattached to the skeleton, allowing for flexibility.\n",
      "Compared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since domestication has seen the dog's skeleton increase in size for larger types such as mastiffs and miniaturised for smaller types such as terriers; dwarfism has been selectively bred for some types where short legs are preferred, such as dachshunds and corgis. Most dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with naturally short tails have as few as three.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dog's skull has identical components regardless of breed type, but there is significant divergence in terms of skull shape between types. The three basic skull shapes are the elongated dolichocephalic type as seen in sighthounds, the intermediate mesocephalic or mesaticephalic type, and the very short and broad brachycephalic type exemplified by mastiff type skulls. The jaw contains around 42 teeth, and it has evolved for the consumption of flesh. Dogs use their carnassial teeth to cut food into bite-sized chunks, more especially meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Senses ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Dogs' senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and magnetoreception. One study suggests that dogs can feel small variations in Earth's magnetic field. Dogs prefer to defecate with their spines aligned in a north–south position in calm magnetic field conditions.\n",
      "Dogs' vision is dichromatic; their visual world consists of yellows, blues, and grays. They have difficulty differentiating between red and green, and much like other mammals, the dog's eye is composed of two types of cone cells compared to the human's three. The divergence of the eye axis of dogs ranges from 12 to 25°, depending on the breed, which can have different retina configurations. The fovea centralis area of the eye is attached to a nerve fiber, and is the most sensitive to photons. Additionally, a study found that dogs' visual acuity was up to eight times less effective than a human, and their ability to discriminate levels of brightness was about two times worse than a human.\n",
      "While the human brain is dominated by a large visual cortex, the dog brain is dominated by a large olfactory cortex. Dogs have roughly forty times more smell-sensitive receptors than humans, ranging from about 125 million to nearly 300 million in some dog breeds, such as bloodhounds. This sense of smell is the most prominent sense of the species; it detects chemical changes in the environment, allowing dogs to pinpoint the location of mating partners, potential stressors, resources, etc. Dogs also have an acute sense of hearing up to four times greater than that of humans. They can pick up the slightest sounds from about 400 m (1,300 ft) compared to 90 m (300 ft) for humans.\n",
      "Dogs have stiff, deeply embedded hairs known as whiskers that sense atmospheric changes, vibrations, and objects not visible in low light conditions. The lower most part of whiskers hold more receptor cells than other hair types, which help in alerting dogs of objects that could collide with the nose, ears, and jaw. Whiskers likely also facilitate the movement of food towards the mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Coat ===\n",
      "The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: \"double\" being common in dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or \"single\", with the topcoat only. Breeds may have an occasional \"blaze\", stripe, or \"star\" of white fur on their chest or underside. Premature graying can occur in dogs as early as one year of age; this is associated with impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, and fear of unfamiliar noise, people, or animals. Some dog breeds are hairless, while others have a very thick corded coat. The coats of certain breeds are often groomed to a characteristic style, for example, the Yorkshire Terrier's \"show cut\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Dewclaw ===\n",
      "A dog's dewclaw is the fifth digit in its forelimb and hind legs. Dewclaws on the forelimbs are attached by bone and ligament, while the dewclaws on the hind legs are attached only by skin. Most dogs are not born with dewclaws in their hind legs, and some are without them in their forelimbs. Dogs' dewclaws consist of the proximal phalanges and distal phalanges. Some publications theorize that dewclaws in wolves, who usually do not have dewclaws, were a sign of hybridization with dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Tail ===\n",
      "A dog's tail is the terminal appendage of the vertebral column, which is made up of a string of 5 to 23 vertebrae enclosed in muscles and skin that support the dog's back extensor muscles. One of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state. The tail also helps the dog maintain balance by putting its weight on the opposite side of the dog's tilt, and it can also help the dog spread its anal gland's scent through the tail's position and movement. Dogs can have a violet gland (or supracaudal gland) characterized by sebaceous glands on the dorsal surface of their tails; in some breeds, it may be vestigial or absent. The enlargement of the violet gland in the tail, which can create a bald spot from hair loss, can be caused by Cushing's disease or an excess of sebum from androgens in the sebaceous glands.\n",
      "\n",
      "A study suggests that dogs show asymmetric tail-wagging responses to different emotive stimuli. \"Stimuli that could be expected to elicit approach tendencies seem to be associated with [a] higher amplitude of tail-wagging movements to the right side\". Dogs can injure themselves by wagging their tails forcefully; this condition is called kennel tail, happy tail, bleeding tail, or splitting tail. In some hunting dogs, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries. Some dogs can be born without tails because of a DNA variant in the T gene, which can also result in a congenitally short (bobtail) tail. Tail docking is opposed by many veterinary and animal welfare organisations such as the American Veterinary Medical Association and the British Veterinary Association. Evidence from veterinary practices and questionnaires showed that around 500 dogs would need to have their tail docked to prevent one injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Health ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Numerous disorders have been known to affect dogs. Some are congenital and others are acquired. Dogs can acquire upper respiratory tract diseases including diseases that affect the nasal cavity, the larynx, and the trachea; lower respiratory tract diseases which includes pulmonary disease and acute respiratory diseases; heart diseases which includes any cardiovascular inflammation or dysfunction of the heart; haemopoietic diseases including anaemia and clotting disorders; gastrointestinal disease such as diarrhoea and gastric dilatation volvulus; hepatic disease such as portosystemic shunts and liver failure; pancreatic disease such as pancreatitis; renal disease; lower urinary tract disease such as cystitis and urolithiasis; endocrine disorders such as diabetes mellitus, Cushing's syndrome, hypoadrenocorticism, and hypothyroidism; nervous system diseases such as seizures and spinal injury; musculoskeletal disease such as arthritis and myopathies; dermatological disorders such as alopecia and pyoderma; ophthalmological diseases such as conjunctivitis, glaucoma, entropion, and progressive retinal atrophy; and neoplasia.\n",
      "Common dog parasites are lice, fleas, fly larvae, ticks, mites, cestodes, nematodes, and coccidia. Taenia is a notable genus with 5 species in which dogs are the definitive host. Additionally, dogs are a source of zoonoses for humans. They are responsible for 99% of rabies cases worldwide; however, in some developed countries such as the UK, rabies is absent from dogs and is instead only transmitted by bats. Other common zoonoses are hydatid disease, leptospirosis, pasteurellosis, ringworm, and toxocariasis. Common infections in dogs include canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, leptospirosis, canine influenza, and canine coronavirus. All of these conditions have vaccines available.\n",
      "Dogs are the companion animal most frequently reported for exposure to toxins. Most poisonings are accidental and over 80% of reports of exposure to the ASPCA animal poisoning hotline are due to oral exposure. The most common substances people report exposure to are: pharmaceuticals, toxic foods, and rodenticides. Data from the Pet Poison Helpline shows that human drugs are the most frequent cause of toxicosis death. The most common household products ingested are cleaning products. Most food related poisonings involved theobromine poisoning (chocolate). Other common food poisonings include xylitol, Vitis (grapes, raisins, etc.), and Allium (garlic, onions, etc.). Pyrethrin insecticides were the most common cause of pesticide poisoning. Metaldehyde, a common pesticide for snails and slugs, typically causes severe outcomes when ingested by dogs.\n",
      "Neoplasia is the most common cause of death for dogs. Other common causes of death are heart and renal failure. Their pathology is similar to that of humans, as is their response to treatment and their outcomes. Genes found in humans to be responsible for disorders are investigated in dogs as being the cause and vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Lifespan ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but the median longevity (the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive) is approximately 12.7 years. Obesity correlates negatively with longevity with one study finding obese dogs to have a life expectancy approximately a year and a half less than dogs with a healthy weight.\n",
      "In a 2024 UK study analyzing 584,734 dogs, it was concluded that purebred dogs lived longer than crossbred dogs, challenging the previous notion of the latter having the higher life expectancies. The authors noted that their study included \"designer dogs\" as crossbred and that purebred dogs were typically given better care than their crossbred counterparts, which likely influenced the outcome of the study. Other studies also show that fully mongrel dogs live about a year longer on average than dogs with pedigrees. Furthermore, small dogs with longer muzzles have been shown to have higher lifespans than larger medium-sized dogs with much more depressed muzzles. For free-ranging dogs, less than 1 in 5 reach sexual maturity, and the median life expectancy for feral dogs is less than half of dogs living with humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Reproduction ===\n",
      "\n",
      "In domestic dogs, sexual maturity happens around six months to one year for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years of age for some large breeds. This is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle, characterized by their vulvas swelling and producing discharges, usually lasting between 4 and 20 days. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy. At the peak of the cycle, females will become estrous, mentally and physically receptive to copulation. Because the ova survive and can be fertilized for a week after ovulation, more than one male can sire the same litter. Fertilization typically occurs two to five days after ovulation. After ejaculation, the dogs are coitally tied for around 5–30 minutes because of the male's bulbus glandis swelling and the female's constrictor vestibuli contracting; the male will continue ejaculating until they untie naturally due to muscle relaxation. 14–16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus, and after seven to eight more days, a heartbeat is detectable. Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization, with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. An average litter consists of about six puppies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Neutering ====\n",
      "Neutering is the sterilization of animals via gonadectomy, which is an orchidectomy (castration) in dogs and ovariohysterectomy (spay) in bitches. Neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, especially in male dogs. Spayed females are less likely to develop cancers affecting the mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs. However, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in bitches, prostate cancer in dogs, and osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, pyometra, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in either sex.\n",
      "Neutering is the most common surgical procedure in dogs less than a year old in the US and is seen as a control method for overpopulation. Neutering often occurs as early as 6–14 weeks in shelters in the US. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) advises that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered so that they do not have undesired puppies that may later be euthanized. However, the Society for Theriogenology and the American College of Theriogenologists made a joint statement that opposes mandatory neutering; they said that the cause of overpopulation in the US is cultural.\n",
      "Neutering is less common in most European countries, especially in Nordic countries—except for the UK, where it is common. In Norway, neutering is illegal unless for the benefit of the animal's health (e.g., ovariohysterectomy in case of ovarian or uterine neoplasia). Some European countries have similar laws to Norway, but their wording either explicitly allows for neutering for controlling reproduction or it is allowed in practice or by contradiction through other laws. Italy and Portugal have passed recent laws that promote it. Germany forbids early age neutering, but neutering is still allowed at the usual age. In Romania, neutering is mandatory except for when a pedigree to select breeds can be shown.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Inbreeding depression ====\n",
      "\n",
      "A common breeding practice for pet dogs is to mate them between close relatives (e.g., between half- and full-siblings). In a study of seven dog breeds (the Bernese Mountain Dog, Basset Hound, Cairn Terrier, Brittany, German Shepherd Dog, Leonberger, and West Highland White Terrier), it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival. Another analysis of data on 42,855 Dachshund litters found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression. In a study of Boxer litters, 22% of puppies died before reaching 7 weeks of age. Stillbirth was the most frequent cause of death, followed by infection. Mortality due to infection increased significantly with increases in inbreeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Behavior ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Dog behavior has been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. They have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and are uniquely attuned to human behaviors. Behavioral scientists suggest that a set of social-cognitive abilities in domestic dogs that are not possessed by the dog's canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals, such as great apes, are parallel to children's social-cognitive skills.  Dogs have about twice the number of neurons in their cerebral cortexes than what cats have, which suggests they could be about twice as intelligent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most domestic animals were initially bred for the production of goods. Dogs, on the other hand, were selectively bred for desirable behavioral traits. In 2016, a study found that only 11 fixed genes showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations indicate the occurrence of artificial selection and the subsequent divergence of behavior and anatomical features. These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response (i.e., selection for tameness) and emotional processing. Compared to their wolf counterparts, dogs tend to be less timid and less aggressive, though some of these genes have been associated with aggression in certain dog breeds. Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans, which cause hypersociability at the expense of problem-solving ability. In a 2023 study of 58 dogs, some dogs classified as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-like showed lower serotonin and dopamine concentrations. A similar study claims that hyperactivity is more common in male and young dogs. A dog can become aggressive because of trauma or abuse, fear or anxiety, territorial protection, or protecting an item it considers valuable. Acute stress reactions from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) seen in dogs can evolve into chronic stress. Police dogs with PTSD can often refuse to work.\n",
      "Dogs have a natural instinct called prey drive (the term is chiefly used to describe training dogs' habits) which can be influenced by breeding. These instincts can drive dogs to consider objects or other animals to be prey or drive possessive behavior. These traits have been enhanced in some breeds so that they may be used to hunt and kill vermin or other pests. Puppies or dogs sometimes bury food underground. One study found that wolves outperformed dogs in finding food caches, likely due to a \"difference in motivation\" between wolves and dogs. Some puppies and dogs engage in coprophagy out of habit, stress, for attention, or boredom; most of them will not do it later in life. A study hypothesizes that the behavior was inherited from wolves, a behavior likely evolved to lessen the presence of intestinal parasites in dens. Most dogs can swim. In a study of 412 dogs, around 36.5% of the dogs could not swim; the other 63.5% were able to swim without a trainer in a swimming pool. A study of 55 dogs found a correlation between swimming and 'improvement' of the hip osteoarthritis joint.\n",

      "=== Nursing ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The female dog may produce colostrum, a type of milk high in nutrients and antibodies, 1–7 days before giving birth. Milk production lasts for around three months, and increases with litter size. The dog can sometimes vomit and refuse food during child contractions. In the later stages of the dog's pregnancy, nesting behaviour may occur. Puppies are born with a protective fetal membrane that the mother usually removes shortly after birth. Dogs can have the maternal instincts to start grooming their puppies, consume their puppies' feces, and protect their puppies, likely due to their hormonal state. While male-parent dogs can show more disinterested behaviour toward their own puppies, most can play with the young pups as they would with other dogs or humans. A female dog may abandon or attack her puppies or her male partner dog if she is stressed or in pain.\n",

      "Researchers have tested dogs' ability to perceive information, retain it as knowledge, and apply it to solve problems. Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference. A study with Rico, a Border Collie, showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items after four weeks of the initial exposure. A study of another Border Collie, Chaser, documented that he had learned the names and could associate them by verbal command with over 1,000 words.\n",
      "One study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are similar to those of horses, chimpanzees, or cats. One study of 18 household dogs found that the dogs could not distinguish food bowls at specific locations without distinguishing cues; the study stated that this indicates a lack of spatial memory. A study stated that dogs have a visual sense for number. The dogs showed a ratio-dependent activation both for numerical values from 1–3 to larger than four.\n",
      "Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. Another experimental study showed evidence that Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans. Another study showed that dogs stared at humans after failing to complete an impossible version of the same task they had been trained to solve. Wolves, under the same situation, avoided staring at humans altogether.\n",

      "=== Communication ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Dog communication is the transfer of information between dogs, as well as between dogs and humans. Communication behaviors of dogs include eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). Dogs mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. Both sexes of dogs may also urinate to communicate anxiety or frustration, submissiveness, or when in exciting or relaxing situations. Aroused dogs can be a result of the dogs' higher cortisol levels. Dogs begin socializing with other dogs by the time they reach the ages of 3 to 8 weeks, and at about 5 to 12 weeks of age, they alter their focus from dogs to humans. Belly exposure in dogs can be a defensive behavior that can lead to a bite or to seek comfort.\n",
      "Humans communicate with dogs by using vocalization, hand signals, and body posture. With their acute sense of hearing, dogs rely on the auditory aspect of communication for understanding and responding to various cues, including the distinctive barking patterns that convey different messages. A study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that dogs respond to both vocal and nonvocal voices using the brain's region towards the temporal pole, similar to that of humans' brains. Most dogs also looked significantly longer at the face whose expression matched the valence of vocalization. A study of caudate responses shows that dogs tend to respond more positively to social rewards than to food rewards.\n",

      "=== Population ===\n",
      "The dog is the most widely abundant large carnivoran living in the human environment. In 2020, the estimated global dog population was between 700 million and 1 billion. In the same year, a study found the dog to be the most popular pet in the United States, as they were present in 34 out of every 100 homes. About 20% of the dog population live in developed countries. In the developing world, it is estimated that three-quarters of the world's dog population lives in the developing world as feral, village, or community dogs. Most of these dogs live as scavengers and have never been owned by humans, with one study showing that village dogs' most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively (11%).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Competitors ===\n",
      "Feral and free-ranging dogs' potential to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with humans. Although wolves are known to kill dogs, wolves tend to live in pairs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage when facing large dog groups. In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs, to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed. Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, there is still a fear among humans of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs, and losses of dogs to wolves have led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.\n",
      "Coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. In particular, leopards are known to have a preference for dogs and have been recorded to kill and consume them, no matter their size. Siberian tigers in the Amur river region have killed dogs in the middle of villages. They will not tolerate wolves as competitors within their territories, and the tigers could be considering dogs in the same way. Striped hyenas are known to kill dogs in their range. Dogs as introduced predators have affected the ecology of New Zealand, which lacked indigenous land-based mammals before human settlement. Dogs have made 11 vertebrate species extinct and are identified as a 'potential threat' to at least 188 threatened species worldwide. Dogs have also been linked to the extinction of 156 animal species. Dogs have been documented to have killed a few birds of the endangered species, the kagu, in New Caledonia.\n",

      "=== Diet ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Dogs are typically described as omnivores. Compared to wolves, dogs from agricultural societies have extra copies of amylase and other genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet. Similar to humans, some dog breeds produce amylase in their saliva and are classified as having a high-starch diet. Despite being an omnivore, dogs are only able to conjugate bile acid with taurine. They must get vitamin D from their diet.\n",
      "Of the twenty-one amino acids common to all life forms (including selenocysteine), dogs cannot synthesize ten: arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Like cats, dogs require arginine to maintain nitrogen balance. These nutritional requirements place dogs halfway between carnivores and omnivores.\n",

      "== Roles with humans ==\n",
      "\n",
      "The domesticated dog originated as a predator and scavenger. They inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for dogs' trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, and probably also their co-existence with early human hunter-gatherers. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, and aiding disabled individuals. These roles in human society have earned them the nickname \"man's best friend\" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are also a source of meat.\n",

      "\n",
      "=== Pets ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history. Pet-dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased. In the 1980s, there have been changes in the pet dog's functions, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians. Within the second half of the 20th century, more and more dog owners considered their animal to be a part of the family. This major social status shift allowed the dog to conform to social expectations of personality and behavior. The second has been the broadening of the concepts of family and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.\n",
      "Products such as dog-training books, classes, and television programs target dog owners. Some dog-trainers have promoted a dominance model of dog-human relationships. However, the idea of the \"alpha dog\" trying to be dominant is based on a controversial theory about wolf packs. It has been disputed that \"trying to achieve status\" is characteristic of dog-human interactions. Human family members have increased participation in activities in which the dog is an integral partner, such as dog dancing and dog yoga.\n",
      "According to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009–2010, an estimated 77.5 million people in the United States have pet dogs. The source shows that nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% own two dogs, and nearly 9% own more than two dogs. The data also shows an equal number of male and female pet dogs; less than one-fifth of the owned dogs come from shelters.\n",

      "=== Workers ===\n",
      "In addition to dogs' role as companion animals, dogs have been bred for herding livestock (such as collies and sheepdogs); for hunting; for rodent control (such as terriers); as search and rescue dogs; as detection dogs (such as those trained to detect illicit drugs or chemical weapons); as homeguard dogs; as police dogs (sometimes nicknamed \"K-9\"); as welfare-purpose dogs; as dogs who assist fishermen retrieve their nets; and as dogs that pull loads (such as sled dogs). In 1957, the dog Laika became one of the first animals to be launched into Earth orbit aboard the Soviets's Sputnik 2; Laika died during the flight from overheating. Various kinds of service dogs and assistance dogs, including guide dogs, hearing dogs, mobility assistance dogs, and psychiatric service dogs, assist individuals with disabilities. A study of 29 dogs found that 9 dogs owned by people with epilepsy were reported to exhibit attention-getting behavior to their handler 30 seconds to 45 minutes prior to an impending seizure; there was no significant correlation between the patients' demographics, health, or attitude towards their pets.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dogs compete in breed-conformation shows and dog sports (including racing, sledding, and agility competitions). In dog shows, also referred to as \"breed shows\", a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in a breed standard. Weight pulling, a dog sport involving pulling weight, has been criticized for promoting doping and for its risk of injury.\n",

      "=== Dogs as food ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Humans have consumed dog meat going back at least 14,000 years. It is unknown to what extent prehistoric dogs were consumed and bred for meat. For centuries, the practice was prevalent in Southeast Asia, East Asia, Africa, and Oceania before cultural changes triggered by the spread of religions resulted in dog meat consumption declining and becoming more taboo. Switzerland, Polynesia, and pre-Columbian Mexico historically consumed dog meat. Some Native American dogs, like the Peruvian Hairless Dog and Xoloitzcuintle, were raised to be sacrificed and eaten. Han Chinese traditionally ate dogs. Consumption of dog meat declined but did not end during the Sui dynasty (581–618) and Tang dynasty (618–907) due in part to the spread of Buddhism and the upper class rejecting the practice. Dog consumption was rare in India, Iran, and Europe.\n",
      "Eating dog meat is a social taboo in most parts of the world, though some still consume it in modern times. It is still consumed in some East Asian countries, including China, Vietnam, Korea, Indonesia, and the Philippines. An estimated 30 million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every year. China is the world's largest consumer of dogs, with an estimated 10 to 20 million dogs killed every year for human consumption. In Vietnam, about 5 million dogs are slaughtered annually. In 2024, China, Singapore, and Thailand placed a ban on the consumption of dogs within their borders. In some parts of Poland and Central Asia, dog fat is reportedly believed to be beneficial for the lungs. Proponents of eating dog meat have argued that placing a distinction between livestock and dogs is Western hypocrisy and that there is no difference in eating different animals' meat.\n",
      "There is a long history of dog meat consumption in South Korea, but the practice has fallen out of favor. A 2017 survey found that under 40% of participants supported a ban on the distribution and consumption of dog meat. This increased to over 50% in 2020, suggesting changing attitudes, particularly among younger individuals. In 2018, the South Korean government passed a bill banning restaurants that sell dog meat from doing so during that year's Winter Olympics. On 9 January 2024, the South Korean parliament passed a law banning the distribution and sale of dog meat. It will take effect in 2027, with plans to assist dog farmers in transitioning to other products. The primary type of dog raised for meat in South Korea has been the Nureongi. In North Korea where meat is scarce, eating dog is a common and accepted practice, officially promoted by the government.\n",

      "In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 59,000 people died globally from rabies, with 59.6% of the deaths in Asia and 36.4% in Africa. Rabies is a disease for which dogs are the most significant vector. Dog bites affect tens of millions of people globally each year. The primary victims of dog bite incidents are children. They are more likely to sustain more serious injuries from bites, which can lead to death. Sharp claws can lacerate flesh and cause serious infections. In the United States, cats and dogs are a factor in more than 86,000 falls each year. It has been estimated that around 2% of dog-related injuries treated in U.K. hospitals are domestic accidents. The same study concluded that dog-associated road accidents involving injuries more commonly involve two-wheeled vehicles. Some countries and cities have also banned or restricted certain dog breeds, usually for safety concerns.\n",
      "Toxocara canis (dog roundworm) eggs in dog feces can cause toxocariasis. It is estimated that nearly 14% of people in the United States are infected with Toxocara; about 10,000 cases are reported each year. Untreated toxocariasis can cause retinal damage and decreased vision. Dog feces can also contain hookworms that cause cutaneous larva migrans in humans.\n",

      "=== Health benefits ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The scientific evidence is mixed as to whether a dog's companionship can enhance human physical and psychological well-being. Studies suggest that there are benefits to physical health and psychological well-being, but they have been criticized for being \"poorly controlled\". One study states that \"the health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal\". Earlier studies have shown that pet-dog or -cat guardians make fewer hospital visits and are less likely to be on medication for heart problems and sleeping difficulties than non-guardians. People with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats or those without pets; these effects are relatively long-term. Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased survival in cases of coronary artery disease. Human guardians are significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who do not own dogs. Studies have found a small to moderate correlation between dog-ownership and increased adult physical-activity levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 2005 paper by the British Medical Journal states: Recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people. Research has, however, pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among children who live with pets. Health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in a pet dog's presence, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety and are exposed to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases (according to the hygiene hypothesis). Other benefits include dogs as social support.\n",
      "One study indicated that wheelchair-users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when accompanied by a dog than when they are not. In a 2015 study, it was found that having a pet made people more inclined to foster positive relationships with their neighbors. In one study, new guardians reported a significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition, which was sustained through the 10-month study.\n",
      "Using dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late-18th century, when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders. Animal-assisted intervention research has shown that animal-assisted therapy with a dog can increase smiling and laughing among people with Alzheimer's disease. One study demonstrated that children with ADHD and conduct disorders who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance, knowledge, and skill-objectives and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared with those not in an animal-assisted program.\n",

      "\n",
      "=== Cultural importance ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Artworks have depicted dogs as symbols of guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, alertness, and love. In ancient Mesopotamia, from the Old Babylonian period until the Neo-Babylonian period, dogs were the symbol of Ninisina, the goddess of healing and medicine, and her worshippers frequently dedicated small models of seated dogs to her. In the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods, dogs served as emblems of magical protection. In China, Korea, and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind protectors.\n",
      "In mythology, dogs often appear as pets or as watchdogs. Stories of dogs guarding the gates of the underworld recur throughout Indo-European mythologies and may originate from Proto-Indo-European traditions. In Greek mythology, Cerberus is a three-headed, dragon-tailed watchdog who guards the gates of Hades. Dogs also feature in association with the Greek goddess Hecate. In Norse mythology, a dog called Garmr guards Hel, a realm of the dead. In Persian mythology, two four-eyed dogs guard the Chinvat Bridge. In Welsh mythology, Cŵn Annwn guards Annwn. In Hindu mythology, Yama, the god of death, owns two watchdogs named Shyama and Sharvara, which each have four eyes—they are said to watch over the gates of Naraka. A black dog is considered to be the vahana (vehicle) of Bhairava (an incarnation of Shiva).\n",
      "In Christianity, dogs represent faithfulness. Within the Roman Catholic denomination specifically, the iconography of Saint Dominic includes a dog after the saint's mother dreamt of a dog springing from her womb and became pregnant shortly after that. As such, the Dominican Order (Ecclesiastical Latin: Domini canis) means \"dog of the Lord\" or \"hound of the Lord\". In Christian folklore, a church grim often takes the form of a black dog to guard Christian churches and their churchyards from sacrilege. Jewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets but requires Jews to feed dogs (and other animals that they own) before themselves and to make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them. The view on dogs in Islam is mixed, with some schools of thought viewing them as unclean, although Khaled Abou El Fadl states that this view is based on \"pre-Islamic Arab mythology\" and \"a tradition [...] falsely attributed to the Prophet\". The Sunni Maliki school jurists disagree with the idea that dogs are unclean.\n",
